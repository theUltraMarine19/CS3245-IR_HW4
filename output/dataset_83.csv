    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONMICHAEL GROVE JFriday 5 November 199970105/92 - REGINA v BRIAN WILLIAM MAXWELLJUDGMENT 
     
      
       
        
        
       
      
    1    HIS HONOUR :  The accused was indicted before me on a count of murder to which he pleaded not guilty but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown Prosecutor declined to accept that plea in discharge of the indictment and the trial proceeded. Some background facts should be recorded and some comments made.  
     
      
       
      
    2    On 24 August 1992 Marilyn Maxwell, the estranged wife of the accused, died as a result of blood loss following a bullet wound. The projectile was discharged from a .22 sawn off rifle being brandished by the accused. That much is not in dispute. The curial history until March 1996 is traced in the various judgments of the High Court published in 184 CLR p501 and following. I have read those judgments but for the purposes of present trial I ignore the factual content, in particular the reported views of Dr Shand and the concession concerning the intention of the accused. As to the latter see per Gaudron and Gummow JJ @ 527.  
     
      
       
      
    3    Upon the matter being remitted from the High Court, a previous election on behalf of the Crown to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter in discharge of the indictment was withdrawn and the indictment was tried by Bruce J sitting without a jury. A conviction for murder following that trial was set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeal in a judgment delivered on 23 December 1998. I have read that judgment. 
     
      
       
      
    4    I confirm my information to counsel that, save the abovementioned and material which has been tendered before me I do not believe that I have accessed extraneous material and in particular I have not read the judgment of Bruce J.  
     
      
       
      
    5    As indicated, the hearing proceeded before me without a jury pursuant to s32 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The parties waived the rules of evidence pursuant to s190 of the Evidence Act 1995. In the result, a substantial part of the trial was conducted by tender of statements by witnesses accompanied by transcripts of testimony given before Bruce J. A transcript of the unsworn statement of the accused at that trial was tendered. This was supplemented by his utterance, again unsworn, of the following four sentences: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Your Honour, I would like to tell the Court what happened. My problem is that it is very difficult for me. I can’t seem to say what I want to say and I get confused; even more confused now than I was at the last trial and I did my best at the last trial. It is very painful for me and I just don’t think I could do it again.”  
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    6    Exceptions were two witnesses who spoke briefly of their acquaintance with and observations of the accused. One of these Raymond Clamback had been overseas at the time of the previous trial and an affidavit by him was received then and re-tendered in this trial. The other exceptions were four psychiatrists, Drs Strum, Jurek, Westmore and Milton whose reports and evidence at the earlier trial were supplemented, in some cases by further reports, and in all cases by testimony. 
     
      
       
      
    7    It is a disturbing observation that an accused citizen is potentially liable to the maximum available penalty known to our law upon judicial decision without any contribution to the finding of guilt by a jury of his peers and after a trial significantly conducted “on paper”. I strongly urge the legislature to consider exempting crimes of the magnitude of murder from s32 of the Criminal Procedure Act or at least restoring to the courts a power to insist upon trial by jury irrespective of any concert between an accused and the Director of Public Prosecutions avoiding it. I suggest that an observation of the course of this trial would provide enlightenment to those theorists who propose that trial without jury is somehow more expeditious. I do not imagine any competent counsel on either side of litigation would engage in examination of psychiatric and psychological hypotheses before a jury to the extravagant degree undertaken in this hearing. 
     
      
       
      
    8    To establish the offence of murder the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that an act of the accused caused the death of Marilyn Maxwell, that the act was deliberate and done with an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. In these respects the central issue of dispute raised on behalf of the accused was his intent or the lack of it.  
     
      
       
      
    9    The routine of the victim was to deliver Guy, the son of herself and the accused to the William Lawson Day Care Centre, Prospect. There was in force an order made in the Local Court restraining the accused from being within five hundred metres of that establishment. 
     
      
       
      
    10    The accused came to the vicinity in a Ford Marquis vehicle which he had purchased on the previous Friday. 24th August was a Monday. He was dressed in work clothes of his current employer Petrolink but covered these with a hooded yellow raincoat. He brought with him the sawn off rifle wrapped in a towel. He positioned himself at the rear of his wife’s car while she was inside the premises delivering Guy. 
     
      
       
      
    11    Upon her return he confronted her with the weapon. Three shots were discharged. One projectile twice passed through fleshy parts of the victim’s arm and grazed her breast, another missed her completely and a third entered her face with fatal consequence. Investigation has not established the order in which these three shots were fired. The accused acquired the keys to his wife’s car and drove from a parking bay towards the public street in an erratic manner. Ultimately following a collision with a post he exited from the car but his departure was prevented by a motorist who used his vehicle to pinion him. The activity of the accused had not gone unnoticed. He was in due course taken into custody and placed in a police van which had been directed to the scene. 
     
      
       
      
    12    At an interview conducted that morning which was recorded on video and audiotape, the accused on occasions described to police how the victim had “grabbed” the gun, the suggestion being that this action caused the discharge. There is no doubt that the act of the accused in presenting the weapon which fired the projectile caused the death. The issues are whether his act was deliberate and what was his intention. I find a path to resolution of these issues can be achieved by answering the question: Is there any credit at all to be attached to the claim of the accused that the deceased grabbed the weapon. The claim was made to police soon after arrest.  
     
      
       
      
    13    I interpolate at this stage that the accused raised his prior good character. He is entitled to have this taken into account both on the likelihood of his committing the crime and upon his credibility. The latter includes the credit to be attached to his assertions to police as well as statements prior and subsequent to the killing which were made to family, acquaintances and medical practitioners and at trial.  
     
      
       
      
    14    I reject the accused’s claim that the victim grabbed the weapon and the implication that such an action caused it to discharge. A principal reason for so finding is the circumstance that three shots were fired. The weapon was semi-automatic and required a separate application of pressure to the trigger for each firing. It is simply not the mechanics of the weapon that it would continue discharging shots (until it jammed) upon continuous application of pressure to the trigger whether provoked by someone grabbing the weapon or otherwise. Thus even if one of the shots had been to any extent provoked by such grabbing, two others were achieved by re-pressuring the trigger. Even if some credibility were attached to this claim of the accused, the reaction of the victim was in my judgment no more than a defensive response to threat and does not relieve him of responsibility for intended killing even if there was some element of the unexpected emerging from the reaction of the target. 
     
      
       
      
    15    I have said however that I do not accept that such occurred. If there had been such an element of the unexpected or accident, I would expect it to be uppermost in the mind of the person who had wielded the weapon. To no one at the scene did the accused make such a claim and I see no reason not to accept the evidence of Mrs Campbell that when challenged the accused said words like “I had to do it, it was the only way. I haven’t seen my son in twelve months. I had to kill her”. Some criticism was directed to Mrs Campbell’s evidence and I have read the cross examination and had reference to the testimonies of other witnesses whose recollection of what the accused said is different. The distinction is of course premised upon the circumstance that all witnesses were hearing the same utterance. I see no reason to regard Mrs Campbell’s evidence as undependable. Contained in it is a plain lie when the accused asserted that he had not seen his son for twelve months and that is compatible with lies and exaggerations to many people concerning the issue of access to his son. Mrs Campbell could have had no knowledge of the accused’s assertions in that regard other than by hearing what he said. Her accuracy in that aspect is persuasive towards the probable accuracy of all that she recalled.  
     
      
       
      
    16    Although at the police station the accused told police about his wife allegedly grabbing the gun early in his time of custody there, there is what I find to be a notable contradiction of the suggestion of the contribution of an element of accident in the evidence. In evidence there is a typescript of the interview but this was taken from audiotape and the video machine with sound track continued to run during an interval while the audiotapes were being changed.  
     
      
       
      
    17    During that period ruminations by the accused were heard on the sound track. These include utterances by the accused “She shouldn’t be dead. Why did I do it? Shooting her was stupid”. There is confirmation that these can be heard in a question asked of Dr Milton at the earlier trial by counsel for the accused the transcript of which was tendered before me: see Exhibit T36 p585 line 52. It is true that these ruminations are not entirely unambiguous but they are hardly consistent with a claim that although he went armed to force his wife to do no more than talk to him, the weapon unexpectedly discharged because she grabbed it. The unprompted remark “Shooting her was stupid” offers a compelling insight into the circumstances and the state of mind of the accused. 
     
      
       
      
    18    I am satisfied to the necessary standard that at the time of the killing, the accused intended so to do. I continue with some further observations and findings which have led me to that conclusion. 
     
      
       
      
    19    Firearms are designed to be lethal. An issue is whether any credibility, however faint, should be attached to the claim by the accused that he intended to present the weapon merely as a threat. I find none. On occasions the accused has given at least three different versions of the provenance of the weapon. He said he purchased it in January 1992 for $4,000. It was then intact and the vendor was a man at Kings Cross. Later he himself cut down the barrel and butt. He has also said that he bought the weapon in January 1992 when it was already shortened and he has further said that he bought it just before the killing. I cannot determine where the truth lies as to the acquisition of the weapon but it is inevitable to conclude that the accused has been lying about the matter on some of the occasions. I mentioned to counsel my scepticism that anyone would pay $4,000 unless there was a premium for illegality (shortened weapons are unlawful) and senior counsel for the accused invited me to find that his client told the truth to police when he said that he paid $4,000 but lied to them about shortening it himself. If that be the case then it is interesting to observe on the video the glib recounting of detail to police by the accused of how he altered the weapon himself and the evidence shows that he later took them on a purposeless journey to search the location where he told them he had abandoned the offcuts. The impression I formed is that the accused is both a ready and a persistent prevaricator.  
     
      
       
      
    20    As a tribunal of fact, I have examined the weapon. From the point of view of an operator it is of exquisite simplicity. Save the magazine which moves on guides and engages a catchlock in the conventional manner - and I note the accused claimed that he never removed the magazine even apparently when he claimed he was shortening the weapon - it has only three functions with which a user need be concerned: the cocking piece, the trigger and the safety catch. 
     
      
       
      
    21    In his unsworn statement at the previous trial the accused claimed that he still did not know what a safety looked like although he added “I was surprised when he showed us it was on top of the gun. I would have thought it was near the trigger”. It is not exactly clear that “he” was the vendor but he referred to a fellow who came in and “told us how guns worked”. That was not consistent with answers to police. When asked about the bullets, the accused said “Well, it (presumably the magazine) was already in and the guy showed me how to do the safety off and everything was there, that was the whole thing - just there.” The safety on this weapon is a simple switch-like button with forward and back positions. The accused said that he test fired the weapon at his mother’s home by discharging a round into a bag of potting mix. There is no objective evidence to confirm this occurrence but neither counsel invited me to doubt it. Even if the accused was unsure whether the weapon was safe when the catch was forward or back, after he test fired it he must have been able to appreciate that he had only to move it into the alternative position in order to engage it.  
     
      
       
      
    22    The accused is a fitter and machinist by trade and a commercial pilot by qualification. These are not academic occupations. I find the claim that he did not recognize and know how to operate the simple safety mechanism ludicrous and I reject it. I find that he knew when he presented the weapon towards his wife that it was in ready to fire mode with the safety catch disengaged. 
     
      
       
      
    23    There is further evidence which convinces me of the accused’s homicidal intention. The operation of the weapon was such that spent cartridge cases would eject and the accused inhibited this by taping over the ejection port. Apart from suggesting that the accused understood somewhat more about the operation of the weapon than his plea of ignorance about the safety catch would have it, his action strongly suggests that thought was given to thwarting any ballistic investigation following use of the rifle. Of course ballistic investigation cannot be effectively undertaken in the absence of a weapon which has been disposed of but the significant matter is that taping the ejection port demonstrates to my mind an intention that the weapon be fired and not simply presented as a threat.  
     
      
       
      
    24    I add that the assertion by the accused to Dr Jurek in 1997 that he applied the tape in order to prevent his mother being upset at finding an empty cartridge case after the test firing I find quite incredible. I note however that his remark confirms his adherence to having test fired the weapon and I note that if he was really worried about the ejected case, he could simply pick it up and dispose of it. The emergence of this tale years after the event fortifies the poor view which I have formed of the accused’s veracity. 
     
      
       
      
    25    A number of subordinate issues were explored. I do not find it necessary to trace all of the detail of every one of them but I have found nothing which erodes my finding that the accused deliberately and intentionally killed. I recognize that the actual event may not have taken place in accordance with an original plan or indeed a plan as varied from time to time to accommodate circumstances and I would not expect that every action would coalesce into an ideal pattern of logical steps but the totality of evidence has led me exorably to the conclusion which I have stated. 
     
      
       
      
    26    Because reliance was placed upon them I should mention a few matters individually. The accused had purchased the Ford Marquis a few days beforehand. On the preceding Saturday access visit the accused had nevertheless driven to his sister-in-law’s home in his mother’s car. The Crown argued that he arrived at the day care centre therefore in a vehicle which he knew his wife would not recognize. Perhaps that was so but I do not regard the circumstances of the purchase of the vehicle and the use of it on that day as specifically inculpatory. The Ford car was searched and found to contain items including a dropsheet. Some of the items were of utility in the accused’s employment at Petrolink. I do not find that the dropsheet was in the conveyance as a potential shroud. The contention to that effect rises no higher than a possibility.  
     
      
       
      
    27    Much reference was made to a hole dug by the accused underneath the home of his mother. I am not satisfied to the requisite standard that this was an intended grave for the victim. That is not to say that I am positively persuaded to the contrary. I do not accept the accused’s version that he was merely digging a hole for a safe in which to keep his mother’s valuables and got carried away. I accept that he had made some enquiries about a safe and the intended structure was to say the least, extraordinary. It would also appear that if such a safe were put in place the accused’s mother would have to retrieve her valuables by going underneath the house where the clearance between under the floor and the ground was minimal. The possibility exists that the hole was intended to have a dual purpose but as I have said I am not satisfied to the requisite standard that I can use this material in proof of guilt of the accused. 
     
      
       
      
    28    My attention was drawn to tools which had been newly painted and it suffices to record also that I do not find anything germane to either the issues of culpability or psychology from that circumstance. 
     
      
       
      
    29    I have mentioned that the accused was at the scene in a yellow raincoat. He was wearing sunglasses and had pantyhose in his pocket. I am satisfied that he intended to disguise himself but his purpose may primarily have been to prevent those at the centre who knew of the restraining order from identifying him. That leads to contemplation of whether such identification might be foreseen to be likely to provoke a call to police but ultimately I do not find that the matter of disguise is useful in contributing to my findings. No doubt when the accused confronted his wife she would recognize him but I am satisfied that he intended to kill her although whether he intended to do so at exactly the time and place that it in fact occurred is not now directly in point. Counsel argued that gaudy outer garments such as the raincoat were more likely to attract attention than deflect it and I think that is correct but the overall picture is of the accused bent upon intended mischief and whilst disguise does not contribute to proof of murder it does not detract from other evidence which sustains that conclusion.  
     
      
       
      
    30    Subject to the partial defence of diminished responsibility made available by s23A of the Crimes Act (to which I will refer simply as s23A), I find the ingredients of murder proved.  
     
      
       
      
    31    In a paper published in 1935, Sir Owen Dixon said of the development of the law of homicide that “for eight centuries the course of its very gradual evolution has been from an almost exclusive concern with the external act that occasioned death to a primary concern with the mind of the man who did the act”: 9 ALJ (Supp) 64. In Ryan v The Queen 1967 121 CLR 205 Windeyer J (@ 238) said of those remarks that “it may be that this process of common law development is as yet unfinished”. 
     
      
       
      
    32    The common law has been qualified by s23A which is applicable to this trial in the form prior to substitution by the Crimes Amendment (Diminished Responsibility) Act 1997. The conduct of this case has involved an expansive analysis of the mind of the accused to the extent that I was provoked to wondering whether expert witnesses had not at times entirely ignored the external acts of the accused, a man on any view obsessed by deprivation of perceived entitlement to access to his son, who armed himself and shot dead the competitor parent. 
     
      
       
      
    33    It will be necessary to refer to a substantial volume of psychiatric expert evidence but it will not be necessary to recapitulate every hypothesis explored in the evidence. A primary reason for this is that much of the hypothetical was dependent upon a variety of possible fact finding and that in turn depended upon the credibility of various assertions by the accused. I have concluded that the accused is not a person whose statements can be regarded as dependable unless there is supporting material. 
     
      
       
      
    34    It is important to emphasize that the onus of proof is cast by statute upon the accused in relation to diminished responsibility and although the standard is upon balance of probabilities, if I cannot for any reason including reservation about foundational material emanating from the accused, determine where the probability lies the defence will not be sustained.  
     
      
       
      
    35    Before proceeding to refer to evidence I should record that I am to varying degrees acquainted with all of the expert witnesses. Any rejection of their views should not be taken as implying that I am in any way doubtful of their respective integrity and professional skill but, as they recognized, the ultimate determination must be made by a tribunal of fact, which desirably would be a cross section of the community constituting a jury but in this case, is me.  
     
      
       
      
    36    Although the prescriptions of s23A are well known I should state them to authenticate my approach to the issues which basically comprise three: 
     
      
       
      
    37    First, was there an abnormality of mind of the type described in the provision, relevantly arising from inherent cause or induced by disease?, 
     
      
       
      
    38    Second, did such abnormality of mind impair mental responsibility for the accused’s act, namely the intentional killing of his wife? and, 
     
      
       
      
    39    Third, if so, was that impairment substantial? 
     
      
       
      
    40    Abnormality of mind exists where there is deviation from the range within which there is variation among normal people to perceive events, to form sensible judgment as to whether an action is right or wrong and to exercise will to control actions in accordance with sensible judgment. 
     
      
       
      
    41    Mental responsibility also involves the ability to exercise will over physical acts and the extent to which the mind is answerable for them. 
     
      
       
      
    42    A substantial impairment is more than trivial or minimal. It is substantial if it is such as warrants the reduction of crime from murder to manslaughter. That definition is articulated in the “new” s23A but it represents an authorized approach to the provision as presently applicable as well. 
     
      
       
      
    43    Retaining therefore a focus upon what needs to be proved to sustain the partial defence, I turn to some evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    44    Dr Strum reported on 6 October 1993. He had seen the accused on ten occasions between April and August of that year. He had also interviewed his mother. Part of the history recorded in the report is disturbing. The accused told of receiving a note a few days before the shooting (elsewhere alleged to have been delivered by Guy at the time of the access visit on the preceding Saturday) which was quoted by Dr Strum in what appeared in his report as verbatim terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Brian 
         
        
        
         
         Guy has been diagnosed as having Perthes Desease (sic). He needs the operation on his hip and he will wear leg braces for twelve months. If you love your son send some money. 
         
        
        
         
         Marilyn.” 
         
        
       
      
    45    It has transpired that Dr Strum has never seen such a note and the parenthetical observation refers not to a spelling error in any original document but in some document (now unable to be produced) which the accused supplied to Dr Strum as part of history.  
     
      
       
      
    46    The disturbing element is the demonstration that the accused not only has been shown to prevaricate from time to time but this would appear to reveal that he is prepared to manufacture evidence even if it is purported to be only secondhand. The accused bears the onus on the issue of diminished responsibility but I am positively satisfied that the alleged note (said to have been on yellow paper) claimed to have been despatched with Guy on the Saturday is a matter of invention. There was in fact a letter from the accused’s wife dated and sent in June which is in evidence and it referred to diagnosis of disease by a general practitioner and informed the accused there had been a referral to a specialist. I accept that Mr Wayne Clamback probably also saw a letter (said to have been on blue paper) making some reference to Guy’s condition. I consider his recollection of the content has probably become faded over the years. He remembered it being said that she (the deceased) wasn’t concerned that he (the accused) had obtained a second opinion. It is factually incorrect that the accused ever obtained a second opinion and this suggests to me that there is some confusion in Mr Clamback’s recollection. He further remembered that the letter said that she was going ahead (with the operation) and asked for money. I am unable to say whether those recollections may not also be tinged with some confusion. 
     
      
       
      
    47    Dr Strum had not seen the letter of 28 June 1992 (which is the only letter which has actually been produced) until he gave evidence at the first trial. After he saw it he volunteered that it was a most reasonable letter. I agree. That such a reasonable letter was written makes me somewhat sceptical that the same author would have shortly thereafter despatched one or two other seemingly unreasonable ones. It was said that there was no medical support for the impression that Guy might be in callipers for a year as mentioned in the June letter and that correctly reflects the evidence. But from wherever Marilyn Maxwell got the idea, she stated in the letter that it was conditional upon the condition worsening and there was no suggestion that it would affect any access by the accused to his son.  
     
      
       
      
    48    I return to Dr Strum’s evidence. In his report of 6 October 1993 he recorded the accused’s “conspiracy” assertion that Guy was being subjected to unnecessary surgery in order to prevent him having access. Dr Strum continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “It is certain that irrespective of the irrationality of this proposition, Mr Maxwell not only believed in its truth at the time but continues to believe in its truth”. 
         
        
        
       I am unable to detect any objective source for Dr Strum’s certainty concerning the accused’s belief especially as it might have existed at the time of the killing. It appears to me that Dr Strum would be reliant upon the credibility of the accused which is somewhat distant from producing certainty, and indeed Dr Strum in his own testimony confirmed that he was aware that the accused had told him untruths from time to time and he himself had wondered about his veracity. 
        
       
      
    49    Dr Strum thought that the delivery of the note on the Saturday with its alleged content could be described as a trigger for the homicide. I have found its existence unproved. Nor am I satisfied that the accused had any belief that a conspiracy existed to subject Guy to unnecessary surgery at all and specifically no belief that such was being undertaken for the purpose of denying him access. The records of the practice and the evidence of general practitioners contradict his claim to have gone to see a doctor upon receipt of the note. My acceptance of that evidence is fortified by my further acceptance of the evidence of Dr Scougall that he had no conversation with the accused and specifically no conversation in which he demanded the joint presence of the parents before he would discuss issues surrounding Guy. A palpable lie about contact with Dr Scougall has been repeatedly advanced by the accused. 
     
      
       
      
    50    Dr Strum’s first diagnosis was that the accused had a depressive illness which had developed into a “full blown major depressive episode”. I do not accept that diagnosis which is based upon unreliable history, parts of which have been falsified by the accused.  
     
      
       
      
    51    I find other difficulties with Dr Strum’s diagnosis. By the time he gave evidence at the first trial he was aware of the opinion of Dr Westmore diagnosing severe personality disorder but significantly discounting depression. In testimony he said he could well understand Dr Westmore’s view but, at that time at least, he did not see it (I assume, diagnosis of the accused having a severe personality disorder) that way. 
     
      
       
      
    52    By the time Dr Strum saw the accused and reported in October this year, he had come to accept Dr Westmore’s opinion in the sense that he now proposed that in 1992 the accused had been suffering from two abnormalities of mind, a basic severe personality disorder on which there was superimposed a depressive illness. Dr Strum recognized that this change may lay him open to criticism and it is to his obvious credit that he nevertheless was prepared to expound it. That does not however make the new view attractive to rely upon. 
     
      
       
      
    53    Reading of the transcript will reveal the need apparently felt by counsel to explore at length the bases of a great many observations made by the experts. For example, Drs Strum and Jurek were examined and cross examined about a view that a personality disorder either develops or can develop from stresses upon extant personality traits or characteristics whereas Drs Westmore and Milton were examined and cross examined about their contrary view that this does not occur. I am not qualified to rule on the dispute, if that is what it is, and I reiterate that my task is to determine whether the evidence persuades me that the accused has discharged the onus of proof cast by s23A. 
     
      
       
      
    54    There are some matters however upon which I can express a view. Dr Strum thought that the accused’s remark concerning the weapon that he “didn’t want a long one” was absurd. I respectfully disagree. Short, that is to say not long weapons are concealable which is a highly desirable quality when a person is arming himself with criminal intent. I was deprived of the opportunity of seeing the accused deliver the lengthy unsworn statement transcribed at the first trial but its content was said to demonstrate thought disorder. The statement certainly pays long attention to irrelevant detail and the description rambling was not inappropriate. I note the various interventions permitted by the trial judge at the first trial for counsel to redirect his client’s attention. However, in reading it I found little difference between its quality and that of many which I have heard or read wherein an accused will elaborate in excruciating detail about peripheral or irrelevant matters and barely touch upon crucial and inculpatory matters. It has not been in my experience unusual for a brief and almost formal denial of guilt to be buried within lengthy elaboration of descriptions of the lifetime contact between an accused and his victim. I am unpersuaded to accept the unsworn statement of the accused as manifesting thought disorder. 
     
      
       
      
    55    I have digressed from dealing with specific expert testimony. A transcript has been taken of counsel’s address in this trial and nothing will be gained by my reproduction in these reasons of the points and counterpoints which can be read there. I should advert to the matters which have led me to the conclusions which I have reached and my reasons for so doing. 
     
      
       
      
    56    I have noted that Dr Strum said that on many occasions he had wondered about the accused’s veracity and I accept that he took that into account when forming his opinions but given what I have found to be falsity in critical information upon which reliance was placed I do not regard those opinions as sustaining the partial defence. I add that the fluidity of opinion as it has changed over a span now exceeding seven years also causes me to have the reservation that anything emerging for expression in 1999 may not reliably be related back to 24 August 1992. 
     
      
       
      
    57    Dr Jurek first saw the accused in 1997. Reporting after seeing him for the second time in April of that year she opined that he was suffering from a Disturbed Mental State, the aetiology of which was a depression with paranoid features. She had at the time seen reports from Drs Strum and Milton but had not seen any from Dr Westmore. She expressed her agreement with Dr Strum’s diagnosis of Acute Depressive Episode and my reasons for declining to rely upon that diagnosis remain applicable. 
     
      
       
      
    58    Dr Jurek said that she assessed the accused as pretty close to psychotic. By 1999 Dr Strum was hypothesizing to the same effect, going so far as to raise the possibility of a M’Naghten defence, that is that the accused may be not guilty on the ground of mental illness. My attention is directed to the accused’s mental state and responsibility on 24 August 1992. Whilst I am conscious of the specialized training attaching to the practice of psychiatry, the weight to be given to such view bearing in mind that to be relevant the view must relate back to the stated date, is somewhat eroded in the absence of any observation of suggestion of psychosis by medical practitioners seeing the accused at the time.  
     
      
       
      
    59    Dr Young saw the accused, on one occasion with his mother, and had discussions mainly about treatment and alleged mistreatment of Guy. He did not formally examine the mental state of the accused but noted that he was disturbed and agitated, obsessed about his son and vindictive towards his wife, but he did not think he was psychiatrically unwell in the delusional sense. Dr Young was seeing the accused between November 1991 and February 1992 and he did not then consider that the accused was psychotic. Dr McPhail described the accused as a belligerent man who on at least one occasion used the consultation to criticise his wife in front of his son. Dr Doust did a fitness for flying examination in December 1991. He noted emotional distress said to centre upon deprivation of access. This was of course an exaggeration as the accused was having access to his son although overnight access had been stopped after an incident at about that time. Dr Doust thought that the accused could rapidly develop an anxiety depression in that state of affairs. I infer therefore that he was not then depressed nor did Dr Doust assess him as psychotic. He expressed concern at about what might happen in the future. 
     
      
       
      
    60    Dr Kitson had an opportunity to observe the accused during a very significant period. He first saw the accused on 15 January 1992 although the consultation was about cholesterol levels. The accused returned to see him on 4 February and spoke about marital problems including alleged difficulty in having access to his son. I repeat, in truth access was not being denied rather the accused was not apparently getting the access which he wished. Dr Kitson thought that the accused “was considerably seriously agitated”. The accused came to see him again on 16 February, 5 March, 8 April and 11 May. These consultations involved distress about the accused’s perception of his family situation. Dr Kitson continued to see him although for medical problems on 2 June, 5 July and 15 August, the lastmentioned occasion being just over one week before the killing. Dr Kitson thought that the accused was depressed and extremely agitated however it offers some indication of the scale of the situation that Dr Kitson did not think that the accused was in need of any treatment other than counselling. This he recommended but the accused did not implement the recommendation telling Dr Kitson that he preferred to continue seeing him. Dr Kitson confirmed that if he had been very concerned about mental state he would have insisted that the accused see a trained counsellor and if he thought that he was even more seriously disturbed he would have insisted that the accused see a psychiatrist. He insisted upon neither of these two things which suggests to me that it is highly unlikely that the accused was psychotic or near psychotic then or at the time of the killing. True Dr Kitson was not a psychiatrist but I would expect the expertise of a competent general practitioner such as Dr Kitson particularly having the advantage of multiple encounters, to extend to perception of the possibility of psychiatric illness and the need for expert consultation. Dr Kitson obviously did not perceive that possibility or need. 
     
      
       
      
    61    I do not place any reliance upon the views of Dr Strum and Dr Jurek, expressed and to a large extent formed many years after, that the accused was at the time of killing near to psychotic. I have already commented on the basic defects in history which infect the views of both Dr Strum and Dr Jurek and therefore their opinion concerning major depressive episode. My reliance upon Dr Jurek’s views is also inhibited by apparent contradiction in some evidence given by her in the first trial on 25 May 1997. As I have noted, she saw the accused in prison in March and April of that year and she testified (transcript p 468) that when she saw him at Long Bay he was not deeply depressed but then expressed an opinion (transcript page 495) that he was still suffering from a major depressive illness. This may be explained in Dr Jurek’s view that the illness fluctuates but if manifestation is capable of fluctuating then I have great difficulty in projecting that opinion back to August 1992 from consultations in 1997 and making a finding that the accused was suffering from abnormality of mind when he engaged in the act of homicide.  
     
      
       
      
    62    I am conscious that Dr Jurek’s references to psycho-dynamics indicate her recognition that neither illness nor human behaviour occurs in a static fashion so that such matters can be frozen as it were at a chosen moment (such as that at which homicide is committed) however there are a number of factual matters and opinions which Dr Jurek apparently relied upon which I do not accept. The accused reported losing about twenty kilos in weight. I reject the evidence of the accused’s mother in corroboration of this and I am not satisfied that it is realistically supported by the evidence of Mr Bone. If anyone would have noticed such a dramatic decline in body bulk I would have expected it to have been Dr Kitson. His evidence tended to the contrary. If the accused had had a weight loss in 1991 he was, as reported to Dr Kitson, gaining in 1992. I find it hard to regard this assertion of weight loss as a reliable foundation for opinion about florid psychiatric illness at 24 August 1992. 
     
      
       
      
    63    I do not share the view that it was “crazy” to test fire the rifle and to tape the ejection port. Even if the claimed intention to assess noise is accepted I would not expect that a single discharge from a .22 rifle (shortened) would be likely to provoke more than momentary curiosity in a neighbourhood. Dr Jurek referred to taping the ejection port in the context of the accused’s assertion to her that he did so because he did not want his mother to be distressed by finding an empty cartridge. As a reason it does not merit Dr Jurek’s description and I have already mentioned that it would be easy enough simply to pick up the shell but more importantly I do not regard what he stated to Dr Jurek as representing the true motive of the accused for sealing off the ejection port. 
     
      
       
      
    64    I do not overlook that in 1997 Dr Jurek explained her report in terms of thinking that the accused suffered a “combination of a depression on top of a personality disorder” which is in harmony with the opinion finally expressed by Dr Strum in 1999. However she was also significantly affected in forming that view by the circumstances of the delivery of the yellow paper note on the Saturday which I am not satisfied existed. Dr Jurek thought this was a trigger for the killing on the following Monday and said that in its absence she would have to concede that she could not see what triggered the killing. 
     
      
       
      
    65    The third psychiatrist called on behalf of the accused was Dr Westmore. He first saw the accused within two weeks of the killing. He was apparently retained by a solicitor then acting for the accused. He next saw him at the request of another solicitor on 5 February 1997. As he conceded at the first trial, when he engaged in the latter consultation and wrote his report, he was not conscious that he had seen and reported on the accused previously and the respective reports were not cross referenced. 
     
      
       
      
    66    The report of 29 September 1992 obviously offers the nearest to contemporary psychiatric assessment of the accused at a time relevant to the killing and the defence raised on his behalf. The opinion and conclusions expressed then, I set out in entirety: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Your client faces the serious charge of murder. The deceased person in this matter is his wife, from whom he was separated for a period of twelve months before the incident leading to her death. It would appear that the issue of access to their son was the focus of much disharmony with Mr Maxwell believing that his wife’s mother and sister controlled and dominated her to the extent that they excluded him seeing his child. 
         
        
        
         
         He expressed his view that his wife was a somewhat inadequate person who was completely controlled by these two people (her mother and sister). 
         
        
        
         
         While your client does not suffer any specific psychiatric disability in the form of a major depressive illness or a psychotic process such a schizophrenia, he clearly was greatly disturbed and distressed by the circumstances surrounding the breakdown of the marriage. In view of the apparent intensity of the relationship he seems to have had with his son, certainly it is as he described it to me, the possibility of the defence provocation should be considered in this case. I should note that at this stage I have no documents relating to the facts in this matter, nor statements of witnesses that might add further history to that provided to me by Mr Maxwell. 
         
        
        
         
         I am a little unclear at this stage as to whether his preoccupation with his son was an abnormal one having already noted that it was an extremely intense one. At this time I do not believe the defence of diminished responsibility is available to him but should there be other evidence to suggest an abnormality of mind being present at the time then I would be happy to review my conclusions. 
         
        
        
         
         If I can provide any further information or assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.” 
         
        
       
      
    67    I can ignore the reference to provocation. It is not suggested that the facts on any view fall within the context of s23 of the Crimes Act. In the course of time Dr Westmore has come to the opinion that the accused suffers from a severe personality disorder, the magnitude of which he assesses as constituting an abnormality of mind. To be relevant to my task such abnormality of mind had to be present on 24 August 1992. Dr Westmore has explained that he would not, save in an exceptional case, diagnose such a personality disorder from a single consultation and I accept that. What demands my attention is the absence of any suggestion in September 1992 that further consultation was indicated. As the above extract shows, there is no request based upon either the accused’s presentation nor even upon intuition, that there should be further examination for assessment. Review was postulated upon the production of other evidence and not any further investigation by the psychiatrist. I find it significant that at a time so proximate to the event Dr Westmore confidently negatived major depressive illness and psychotic process. 
     
      
       
      
    68    My conclusion is that nothing in the presentation of the accused to the expert offered even suspicion that he was suffering from a personality disorder of the magnitude now suggested - or, given the absence of mention - at all.  
     
      
       
      
    69    When Dr Westmore was retained on the second occasion, he first reported (7 February 1997) that he would require further consultation before he could form an opinion. This was arranged and in his report of 2 April 1997 he offered the opinion of severely disturbed personality to be classified as disorder. He has adhered to that view and his conviction in it has been intensified by many encounters with the accused since. Dr Westmore has described how the accused even approaches him when he is at the prison to see someone else and he has observed the same traits and characteristics manifested in such an extreme way that he is even more certain in his conclusion about disorder. I recognize that Dr Westmore has said that it is necessary for him (or for anyone) to see the accused on many occasions in order for the impressions to be communicated and diagnosis made. 
     
      
       
      
    70    I accept what I understand to be the conventional definition that a personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behaviour that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment. On that definition, of course, if Dr Westmore’s present diagnosis is correct then, absent its identification or observation of suggestions of its presence at the interview in September 1992, the disorder must nevertheless have been extant. 
     
      
       
      
    71    This leads to comment upon testimony from Dr Milton who was called by the Crown. He has never interviewed the accused. It was said by counsel that this was because the request was made after Dr Milton had written a report to the representatives of the prosecution. Where the Crown bears the onus of proof of guilt, no adverse inference can be drawn from an accused exercising the privilege of silence. I apprehend that the situation is different when by express legislation the accused bears the onus of proof, however I infer that the accused acted on legal advice in refusing to see Dr Milton and I do not weigh that circumstance against his interest. I deal with the issues on the objective basis that Dr Milton did not have the experience of consultation which was available to Drs Strum, Jurek and Westmore. 
     
      
       
      
    72    As I perceive the situation the final views of Drs Milton and Westmore are not greatly separated. Although there is the difference to which I will refer, it is of interest to note that Dr Milton’s present view is highly compatible with that expressed by Dr Westmore when he saw the accused in 1992. Dr Milton acknowledged that the accused manifested a number of personality traits and characteristics but he did not assess them as constituting diagnosed disorder. Dr Westmore considered that they do. Of course there are differences in the material upon which they each rely to reach their respective conclusions but little would be gained by my attempting to collate and tabulate all the pros and cons.  
     
      
       
      
    73    One matter to which I will refer in deference to the extent of attention paid by counsel concerns a remark by Dr Milton about Dr Westmore’s inability to classify the personality disorder which he diagnosed into a particular category. Dr Westmore opined that the disorder was of a mixed type. My attention was drawn, as was that of witnesses on many occasions, to the 4th Edn of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - DSM IV. That publication refers to ten specific patterns of personality disorder: paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissistic, avoidant, dependent and obsessive-compulsive respectively. DSM IV however recognizes “disorder not otherwise specified” including cases where a person’s pattern meets the general criteria for several of the traits. This last I understand to comprehend Dr Westmore’s diagnosis of mixed disorder. For myself, I reach no conclusion adverse to the case being presented for the accused by reason of the absence of specific label. 
     
      
       
      
    74    I earlier mentioned the videotaping at the police station on the morning of 24 August. The video tapes have been viewed by the experts and somewhat intensely studied by Dr Milton in the absence of direct contact with the accused. I am in a position similar to Dr Milton. It is an interesting observation by Dr Westmore who apparently had not seen the tapes until recently that upon viewing them he described that “he is an obsessional narcissistic man, he externalizes responsibilities for his actions onto others, his themes are generally ones of trying to provide some rational explanation or justification for his actions towards his wife”. Save that I would substitute “justification for killing her” for the somewhat euphemistic “rational explanation or justification for his actions towards his wife”. Dr Westmore’s words offer a fair general description of my own impression. 
     
      
       
      
    75    My conclusion about the divergence of view between Dr Westmore and Dr Milton is that they differ essentially as to degree. My task is not to certify the correctness of any such opinion and I am far from qualified so to do. My task is to apply the evidence which I accept to answering two of the three questions which I have posed concerning s23A, whether there was a deviation from the range over which normal people might vary in the perception of events, the ability to judge right and wrong and will power to control physical acts (as possessed by the accused at the time of his homicidal act) and second, whether if so, the impairment of mental responsibility which that represents was substantial so that it warrants reduction of what was otherwise murder to manslaughter.  
     
      
       
      
    76    When Dr Milton gave evidence at the first trial he was cross examined (25 May 1997) about some evidence which he had given in the trial of an accused Mr Nguyen where he had said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Well, my own impression was that this was not the result of a depressive illness or psychiatric disorder. It brings up I suppose in a way a kind of philosophical issue really but psychiatrists will sometimes see human behaviour as a disease, whereas this is often the way humans have been behaving for thousands of years. 
         
        
        
         
         Psychiatrists will often perceive a particular behaviour as disease whereas if you look at literature, history and everything else, it is the way human beings have been behaving right through history and they regarded it as normal tragedy, normal suffering if you like, part of the way of ordinary life, is difficult life. As we all know life wasn’t meant to be easy and that psychiatrists, I think, have a tendency to say that look, this is a disease because it fits with certain criteria and I think that although psychiatric disease involves human suffering, not all human suffering is necessarily disease or abnormality of the mind, if you like, putting it in legal terms.” 
         
        
       
      
    77    Coincidentally that very passage was sometime after the first trial described as a sound commonsense approach to be taken (to diminished responsibility) in the Court of Criminal Appeal: R v Nguyen CCA unreported 20 March 1998 per Hunt CJ at CL.  
     
      
       
      
    78    In a report prepared on 8 October 1999 Dr Milton confirmed his adherence to the above view and stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “When I gave evidence I referred to what I believed to be a tendency in psychiatry to expand the borders of illness, the result being that a considerable amount of ordinary human suffering or individual differences might be regarded (especially in legal proceedings involving a serious offence) as abnormality. Mr Maxwell has been described as being discursive, obsessional, self centred, and unduly suspicious. Dr Westmore considers these constitute a personality disorder, but was unable to classify it into a particular category. Homicide is a rare crime and it is likely that those committing it will have personalities different, in the main, from the rest of the population. That does not, in my view, constitute sufficient reason to make a diagnosis of personality disorder (especially of a non specific kind) and to regard the personality disorder as substantially diminishing a person’s responsibility for having committed a serious crime.” 
         
        
       
      
    79    I have commented above on the absence of specificity of disorder but, placing that to one side, the balance of Dr Milton’s remarks do attract me as a sound commonsense basis for approach. 
     
      
       
      
    80    I am acutely conscious that from the torrent of words in the reports and the testimonies there can be constructed plausible theses for support of a partial defence but, as the witnesses recognized, the task of evaluation must be undertaken by the tribunal of fact. Although, as is obvious in its expression, s23A is concerned with mental responsibility I do not believe that the law has developed to a point where when dealing with it, it is appropriate to ignore the external acts. Indeed the necessity so to do can be demonstrated by extrapolation from the evidence. It was remarked that psycho-dynamic theorists postulate that anger and depression are external and internal manifestations of the same thing. It is difficult to imagine that the community (or the law) would accept that anger in isolation, however heightened, would diminish responsibility for intentional killing nor that such is contemplated by s23A. Yet it was accepted by all expert witnesses that depression (even of the non-endogenous variety) was an available basis for the defence. Logically then, if so, why not anger? I do not suggest that this theory or my comment is directly relevant to present findings but it is mentioned as a demonstration of the seeming paradoxes that, if one chooses, can be extracted from the evidence. It is therefore relevant in my view to bear in mind that the accused executed the homicide after preparing by arming himself with a loaded weapon with disengaged safety and lying in wait for the victim. 
     
      
       
      
    81    I shall summarize some conclusions. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused was at the time of the killing suffering from what I will call for convenience clinical depression. Neither Dr Westmore nor Dr Milton supports that view and I have mentioned the deficiencies of fact underlying the formation of those opinions which do support depression. I have not thought it necessary to detail the endorsements in the prison medical file but it suffices to say that they do not corroborate major depressive episode as the accused was observed shortly after 24 August and I have considerable reservation about the proposition that killing could have a cathartic effect of ameliorating such a condition if it existed. I record that there was hearsay evidence about opinion concerning the availability of a defence of diminished responsibility said to be held particularly by Dr Barclay and Dr Lewin. The suggestion was not that their opinions advanced the case of the accused but in the circumstances I have put what was said entirely to one side and that hearsay has not contributed to any conclusion which I have reached. 
     
      
       
      
    82    I have given careful consideration to whether the thesis proposed by Dr Westmore that the accused is suffering and was suffering severe personality disorder should be accepted. The firming of his view by repeated contact with the accused conveyed considerable conviction and as I have said, by definition if the accused now has a personality disorder of the requisite diagnosable severity, then it was extant in 1992. My final conclusion is that the accused has not discharged the onus of proof in relation to this issue. The cogency of Dr Westmore’s opinion is undermined by the absence of any reference to any signs or indications of the possibility of such at the early and therefore, in a temporal sense, most advantageous consultation. Second, given that a matter of degree is involved, I consider weight should be given to the estimates of Dr Milton which have been consistent throughout and consistent with the philosophy which he has disclosed and espoused. I do not consider that the relatively late arrival of support for the diagnosis of severe personality disorder from Dr Strum and Dr Jurek brings the balance of probability into the accused’s favour. 
     
      
       
      
    83    I am not, of course, holding that the accused does not and did not have personality traits including being obsessional, discursive, narcissistic and suspicious, nor do I reject the notion that in the crisis in which he perceived himself he could be described as being in marked distress. That was very much the way Dr Westmore first saw him and Dr Milton still sees him. The issue is whether or not the degree of traits are such that abnormality of mind can be diagnosed. 
     
      
       
      
    84    I am unpersuaded that the accused’s symptoms, traits or characteristics affected his perception, judgment and control in the relevant ways so that I assess him to be outside the variation I would estimate for normal people in the circumstances. I am not persuaded on the evidence that the accused has proved that he was at the time suffering from a relevant abnormality of mind. 
     
      
       
      
    85    Further, assuming to the contrary of my findings that the accused did suffer an abnormality of mind in the relevant sense, I would not assess impairment of mental responsibility as substantial. I recognize that such is a value judgment but I take into account all the surrounding facts including the preparations made by the accused, arming himself, not applying the safety, disguise and lying in wait for the victim. I do not consider any impairment warrants reduction of his crime to manslaughter. 
     
      
       
      
    86    I find the accused guilty of murder as indicted and enter verdict and judgment of conviction accordingly.

      JUDGMENT 
      
     
     
     (On directed verdict of acquittal) 
       
    1   GREG JAMES, J: At the close of the Crown case, counsel for the accused moved for a directed verdict of acquittal. The Crown did not concede that such verdict should be directed but did make some significant concessions. Those concessions included that, in the evidence to which I will turn shortly, there was raised self-defence in the sense that is referred to as a defence by the High Court of Australia in Zecevic v. The Director of Public Prosecutions (1987) 162 CLR 645. That is, that the evidence established that, in the physical dispute between the accused and the deceased, there was material which raised the possibility that the accused believed, on reasonable grounds, it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did and that what he did did not exceed what he believed was reasonably necessary for the purpose of defending himself. But the bases upon which the application was made went further than the contention that the response was justified or excused by the law of self-defence. 
    2   Mr. Young, who appeared on behalf of the accused, put the application on three bases, the first that the evidence in the case did not establish, in the circumstances in which the accused and the deceased were engaged in the fight, an act causing death, in this case, an act causing the penetration of the deceased's heart by a knife used by the accused, was done other than accidentally. That is to say, Mr. Young contended that the evidence did not go further than establish the mere occurrence of that penetration so that it could not be found by the jury that the penetration was occasioned by a willed or deliberate act in the sense spoken about by Sir Garfield Barwick in Ryan v. The Queen (1967) 121 CLR 205. 
    3   Mr. Young also contended that there was insufficient evidence to establish, in the event that there was a willed act involving the use of the knife, an intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm with the knife. Both of those intentional states would be necessary for the offence concerned to be murder. A further intentional state, that is, reckless indifference to the taking of a human life, while provided for by s.18 of the Crimes Act 1900 was disclaimed by the Crown as being available in these circumstances earlier on in the trial. This is not surprising given the reference in Zecevic (supra) by the High Court at 662 in the judgment of the majority, Wilson, Dawson and Toohey, JJ., that ""recklessness may be put to one side as having no apparent relevance in the context of self-defence"". 
    4   For my own part, I am at a loss as to what their Honours meant, since that minimal intentional state consistent with the crime charged most likely to be proved in the circumstances accompanying a striking, albeit for the purpose of defending oneself, is an adverting to the possibility or probability of occasioning death but striking nonetheless to achieve the object of personal security. 
    5   Mr. Young contended on this second basis that, at the most, a reckless disregard for the occasioning of grievous bodily harm might be established and that, in New South Wales at least, unlike at Common Law (see Crabbe v. The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 464) it is insufficient to establish murder. Both counsel had, during the course of the trial, reviewed the decision of the High Court in Cutter v. The Queen (1997) 94 A. Crim. R. 152. 
    6   Mr. Young also put his submissions on the basis that the evidence in the circumstances was incapable of rebutting the self-defence that the Crown evidence itself raised, if not established. 
    7   Interestingly, in this case the evidence in the case was almost entirely common ground. The one doubtful element was in the evidence from the one eye witness who had the most continued presence at the scene of the killing, Mr. Steengraver, whose evidence it was conceded by the Crown, was entirely partisan to such an extent that at the conclusion of his evidence the Crown assented to the proposition that a Jury would have to be directed in due course that such evidence as he gave adverse to the accused might well be regarded by the jury as unreliable and would call for a direction under s.165 of the Evidence Act. 
    8   In response, the Crown put its position as really relying on the use of excessive force by the accused, ie., more force than he reasonably believed was necessary to meet the exigency in which he believed he was placed. It should be noted, when considering questions of self-defence in murder that, unless the Crown proves the intentional state necessary, that question of self-defence in one sense does not really arise. However, it is almost impossible to imagine the situation in which the intentional state should be considered separately and apart from the events that gave rise to the formation of the intent and the purpose of the accused's actions which are bound up in that issue. 
    9   If there was a killing committed intentionally by an accused desiring the death of the person the accused intended to kill but only because that intent or desire had been formed in order to protect the accused against the perceived necessity caused by a life-threatening attack, the accused has the defence of self-defence. Indeed, when one refers to onus and standard, when the matter is raised, it is incumbent on the Crown to be able to point to an hypothesis the jury could accept as rebutting all other inconsistent hypotheses. So that where there is some evidence raising self-defence, for guilt the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act was not performed in the exercise of an attempt at self-defence. That has been the law in England at least since Woolmington v. The Director of Public Prosecutions [1935] AC 462 and which in Australia, has been considered to be the law since before Parker v. The Queen (1963) 111 CLR 610. 
    10   Here then the evidence presents a problem in that, although self-defence is raised and although it is the Crown evidence which raises it and although there appears to be no evidence by way of contradiction, it is often said that one should proceed on a no case submission disregarding such evidence as might raise self-defence as that would be evidence by way of qualification to which regard should not be paid on an application of this kind. The test and the manner of its application is laid down in The Queen v. Doney (1990) 171 CLR 207. 
    11   It is, however, accepted in this case by the Crown and by the defence that for me to undertake a course of attempting to winnow out that which might qualify other evidence led by the Crown to seek to detect a case divorced from the evidence supporting self-defence, would be artificial in the extreme. I agree. The whole of the Crown case is entirely consistent as there being a physical dispute between the two in which the deceased was the initial aggressor; the deceased at relevant times was on top of the body of the accused and the Crown concedes it is unable to show that the accused did not believe, on reasonable grounds (as he said to his wife when overheard by the police) that the deceased was attempting to kill him by choking him. 
    12   In those circumstances, and taking the evidence as a totality, the Crown has submitted that an analysis can be undertaken, since there were four wounds occasioned to the deceased which, based on the medical evidence of Dr. Oettle would enable one to find a particular sequence for those wounds so as to elucidate whether there was an intent such as to make s.18 of the Crimes Act applicable or alternatively, there was a continued progression of blows of increasing force and gravity by the accused such as might tend to establish self-defence. 
    13   The Crown has conceded that such an analysis, however, leaves it really on the horns of a dilemma. The Crown put it as suffering from the effects of a two-edged sword. That is to say, that if the sequence does not show an increasing progression of severity of wounding, then there does not seem to be a basis on which intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, absent self-defence, is raised. Whereas, if there is an increasing progression, so the Crown has conceded, that tends to support the proposition that there was such an intent but an intent inseparable from a desire to defend, oneself reasonably based. 
    14   The test, at the close of the evidence, has been expressed in Doney (supra), by Glass, J. in his article in 51 ALJ ""The Sufficiency of Evidence for a Case to Answer"" and in a circumstantial evidence case, in The Queen v. JMR (1991) 57 A. Crim. R. 39. That test requires that the Crown evidence raise an hypothesis of guilt by evidence capable of establishing that guilt beyond reasonable doubt and that hypothesis be such that, although there might be other hypotheses available on the evidence, a jury acting in accordance with its lawful function and in accordance with a proper direction, can reject those other hypotheses. 
    15   In this case the issue squarely enough turns on whether or not, on this evidence, the Jury could reject the hypothesis that the accused acted in self-defence in the sense of responding to a situation not of his making which called for the use of force, indeed deadly force, for him to protect his own life and reasonably believing that such force might be necessary. That is whether the situation was such that the Crown could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that his resort to such force was not believed by him to be reasonably necessary. 
    16   The question had been raised with counsel to consider last week during the trial to afford counsel an opportunity to put considered submissions to me. They have done so. I have concluded that it would not be open to the jury, if the matter was left to them, to find the accused guilty of murder; that it might have been open to the jury to have found an intent at least to cause grievous bodily harm; that it was open to the jury to find that the blows that were struck were willed acts in the sense referred to in Ryan (supra) but that if the jury accepted that there was an intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, they could not have done so by setting aside self-defence. 
    17   In those circumstances, I invited counsel to address me also on whether there might be the alternative verdict of manslaughter available. The Crown concedes that in those circumstances, if self-defence is available to a charge of murder, then there is no adequate basis on which manslaughter might be left independently. 
    18   I therefore determine that, on the evidence as it stands, the proper course will be to direct the verdict of acquittal on the basis I have set out. ********

    2    GROVE J :  The appellant was convicted after a trial before Naughton DCJ and a jury at Sydney District Court on an indictment for robbery in company. On 9 December 1997 three males entered the Commonwealth Bank branch in King Street Newtown. An offender alleged to be the appellant jumped over the counter carrying a screwdriver and then opened a staff door enabling the other two to enter the non-public area of the bank. Cash totalling just over $4,000 was taken from various sections of the premises and the three men fled to a nearby carpark where they entered a car and departed from the area. 
     
      
       
      
    3    Bank security cameras had been activated. The developed photographs were later shown to police officers, several of whom gave evidence that they recognized the appellant as a person in the photographs. Those police were, in various circumstances, acquainted with the appellant. The photographs were also shown to Linda Castles, a youth worker at a residence where the appellant had stayed for various periods. She also recognized the appellant.  
     
      
       
      
    4    The appellant was sentenced to a total of six years and six months penal servitude divided into minimum and additional terms of three years and six months and three years respectively. The appeal has been pursued against conviction only. 
     
      
       
      
    5    The grounds of appeal were expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         Ground One: 
          The identification evidence from the police officers and Linda Castles should have been excluded. This was opinion evidence of a kind which the jury should not have taken into consideration in criminal proceedings. 
         
        
        
         
         Ground Two: 
          His Honour was in error when he ruled that counsel for the appellant was not to mention the nature of police evidence in his address to the jury. This was the appellant’s counsel was not to refer to matters of the type raised by the High Court in  
         McKinney v the Queen 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         Ground Three: 
          His Honour failed to direct the jury in accordance with the directions set out in  
         McKinney v the Queen 
         . If the opinion evidence of the police officers was to be admitted in this case these directions were called for. 
         
        
        
         
         Ground Four: 
          His Honour misdirected the jury in relation to the use that could be made of the accused’s interview with the police. 
         
        
        
         
         Ground Five: 
          His Honour misdirected the jury in relation to the accused’s failure to give evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         Ground Six: 
          The convictions are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.” 
         
        
       
      
    6    The argument in support of ground 1 was presented in common with appeals in matters of Mundarra Smith and Lee West. All three appeals involved argument asserting the inadmissibility of evidence of recognition by persons viewing photographs which were the product of security cameras. The concurrent hearing took place at the request of and with the consent of all parties. The approval of the Court was readily given to that sensible and practical procedure. All the appellants were present during the hearing of argument.  
     
      
       
      
    7    For the reasons given by Sheller JA in the matter of Mundarra Smith in which judgment I have concurred, I am of the opinion that ground 1 cannot be sustained. 
     
      
       
      
    8    The further grounds in the present appeal are not in common with the other two and, as their terms reveal, relate in the case of grounds 2-5 to rulings and directions by Naughton DCJ. Ground 6 is intimately interwoven with the other grounds. 
     
      
       
      
    9    Ground 2 as expressed does not clearly focus upon the complaint that is sought to be made. The reference to McKinney v The Queen (1991 171 CLR 468) serves to obscure the point rather than illuminate it. After the close of the Crown case there was some discussion between the learned trial judge and counsel in which it was indicated that the appellant did not intend to give evidence and matters germane to further conduct of the trial including the content of his Honour’s proposed charge to the jury were canvassed. There was an overnight adjournment. Counsel then appearing for the appellant (who did not appear in the appeal) contended that transcript notations from the previous day in summary form were not accurate. What was said in the morning appears to have been taken down verbatim and it is inferred that there was then an adjournment because the transcript next records: 
     
      
       
        
         
        
        
         
         “UPON RESUMPTION 
         
        
        
         
         (Mr Jauncey indicated in relation to the issue of his raising the status of a police officer being professional or experienced his intention is to not do that in direct relation to the police but merely to say to the jury that in assessing the witnesses they are quite entitled to take into account their of demeanour and also to take into account such experience as they have had in the past in giving evidence and to leave it at that. Discussion ensued). 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I reject it. I think it is highly offensive and improper.” 
         
        
       
      
    10    It is plain (“Discussion ensued”) that the transcript does not purport to record the entirety of what occurred. No affidavit has been tendered to seek to fill the gap. 
     
      
       
      
    11    The focus of complaint in this court has been upon the asserted inhibition upon counsel’s address. Insofar as counsel was foreshadowing an intention to invite the jury to take into account the demeanour and past experience of policemen in giving evidence when assessing them, his intention was unexceptionable. It could not possibly be offensive or improper to invite a jury as fact finders to consider, in effect, that those who have undergone the experience of giving evidence on multiple previous occasions may well present with a demeanour of confidence and apparent dependability, and to ask the jury to contemplate that such impressions might be the result of practice rather than integrity of the evidence. Juries are frequently invited to consider whether a superficially impressive witness who has the benefit of practice is necessarily a witness of truth. Colourful address in attack upon reliability of police evidence such as that of which an extract appears in Carr v The Queen 1988 165 CLR 314 @ 323 was described as forceful and did not provoke rebuke: Per Wilson & Dawson JJ @ 322; Brennan J (as he then was) described the particular address as a “powerful and proper attack” @ 329. In contrast, the stated intention of counsel in this instance was mild and could not be categorized as offensive or improper. 
     
      
       
      
    12    This Court does not have the benefit of any information as what was said when “discussion ensued” was recorded. It is possible that his Honour’s remarks related to something then said rather than what has been summarized by the court reporter, however the intention of counsel as summarized was treated as an inhibitive ruling and such a ruling was erroneous. Unsurprisingly, counsel for the Crown in the appeal (who did not prosecute at trial) was misled by the terms of ground 2 and the reference in it to McKinney v The Queen. The references both at trial and in the expression of the ground were, I would presume, derived from the joint judgment (@ p 476) where the words “police witnesses are often practised witnesses and it is not an easy matter to determine whether a practised witness is telling the truth” appear. Trial counsel seems at that stage to have ignored that those words were used expressly within the context of a warning held to be requisite where the substantial basis for a finding of guilt is a confessional statement alleged to have been made whilst an accused was in police custody.  
     
      
       
      
    13    Upon the focus of the ground being disclosed in the appeal the Crown Prosecutor fairly conceded that counsel “should have been entitled to make that submission to the jury and it is unfortunate that he felt constrained not to by something that his Honour said”. Nevertheless it was submitted that the error related to a matter that was so subordinate in the context of the trial that the Court should apply the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. That proviso can be applied if the Court is satisfied that, despite the error, no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
     
      
       
      
    14    What was inhibited was one submission concerning a matter to be weighed in the assessment by the jury of several witnesses. The police officers who testified that they recognized the appellant in the photographs were asked questions concerning their experience. The nature of the challenge was made plain, for example Detective Crampton was asked whether part of courses which he had done included training in the giving of evidence in court and he responded that he had received some but very limited training. 
     
      
       
      
    15    Given the exploration of matters in cross examination, although I have concluded that it was erroneous to prevent counsel from making the particular submission, I have reached the conclusion that having regard to what was really the sole central question for the jury (whether the appellant had been proved to be one of the robbers) had the matter which counsel wished to canvass been addressed, no different result would have followed. My conclusion is fortified by observing that the testimony of Linda Castles concerning her recognition of the appellant in the security camera photographs was independent of the police witnesses and the inhibited submission could not have been relevant to that evidence. There has been no miscarriage and I would apply the proviso. 
     
      
       
      
    16    Ground three contends that McKinney v The Queen is authority for the proposition that if the “opinion” (that is to say, recognition) evidence of police officers was to be admitted, a direction should be given warning the jury of the danger of convicting on the basis of that evidence. At the conclusion of the summing up and in response to the conventional invitation counsel submitted: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “In relation to the point which I raised yesterday where I described in my notes to your Honour as professional witness in relation to the police and I said that should be more in terms of being experienced witnesses. I draw your attention again to that. I refer your Honour to the decision of McKinney and the Queen 171 CLR 468 which specifically deals - although in that context is where the contested evidence of police was oral admissions, the general warning - with all due respect your Honour a warning which is given generally in these courts as to police. Your Honour was talking about the demeanour of the witnesses. Counter-balancing that to take into account the fact that some persons, particularly police officers, are experienced in giving evidence.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    17    McKinney is not authority for such a proposition. That case had to do with the perceived special position of vulnerability of an accused to fabrication of a confession said to have been made whilst held in the police detention. In Carr v The Queen 1988 165 CLR 314 some general considerations of occasions for warning were canvassed, some with particular reference to police evidence. In my assessment, it appears that trial counsel was somewhat elliptically adverting to the remarks in McKinney concerning the difficulty in determining the truthfulness of practised witnesses and contending that there was a need in the circumstances of the case for a warning by application of an approach such as suggested in the majority judgments in Carr. 
     
      
       
      
    18    The present case was not one in which police witnesses were corroborating each other about some matter and the jury were being invited simply to accept their evidence on the basis of their combined credibility. There were resources available other than the content of the evidence and the demeanour of the witnesses who gave it. The recognition evidence was able to be assessed by the jury in the context of two important circumstances: first, they were able to examine the photographs for themselves and, second, the accused was before them in person. This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      
    19    I turn to ground four. Although the appellant elected not to give evidence, a denial that he was the person depicted in the security camera photographs was made when he was interviewed by police. The content of the relevant interview was before the jury. His Honour gave this direction: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The accused had a choice whether or not to be interviewed by the police. He chose to be interviewed by them. If he had not chosen to be interviewed by the police no adverse inference could have been drawn against him because of that choice. The accused does not have to prove anything. It is for the Crown to prove its case and the accused is presumed to be innocent until such time as he is found to be guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         The accused was interviewed by Detective Lanyon on 18 December 1997. The interview was electronically recorded. You have seen a video of the edited interview and heard an audio tape of what was said in that edited interview. You have been provided with copies of a typed transcript of the edited interview. That is Exhibit “H”. 
         
        
        
         
         That material is evidence before you which you are entitled to take into account. It is not evidence on oath and it was not subject to cross-examination by counsel for the Crown when the interview took place. It has not been possible for the Crown to cross-examine the accused on it in court because the accused has exercised his legal right not to give evidence on oath in court. 
         
        
        
         
         It is a matter for you what you make of the accused’s answers to questions from Detective Lanyon in the police interview. In that interview the accused denied having any knowledge of anything to do with the robbery. He denied that he was in any of the five photographs shown to him by Detective Lanyon, Exhibit “K”, the prints from Exhibit “A”.  
         
        
        
         
         In the interview the accused declined an invitation to participate in a police identification parade as I have already mentioned, and questions and answers 101 and 102 refer to that. I have already told you that he had no duty to accept the invitation and that no adverse inference can be drawn against him on that account. 
         
        
        
         
         You are entitled to give the accused’s answers to the questions put to him by the police on 18 December 1997 such weight as you think fit bearing in mind that they were not given on oath in court after the prosecution witnesses had given evidence in court on oath, and the answers to the police questions were not subject to testing by cross-examination by Madam Crown. 
         
        
        
         
         I remind you, however, that the accused has no obligation to contradict the evidence on oath by the Crown witnesses. He is not obliged to prove his innocence and you cannot conclude that he has anything to hide by not contradicting it.” 
         
        
       
      
    20    In my view the directions given by his Honour were untainted by error. Complaint is made that his Honour did not instruct the jury as to how they might use the evidence but this is to ignore the content. The content was a denial by the appellant of the only real issue in the case, namely a denial that he was one of the robbers who invaded the bank. I would reject this ground. 
     
      
       
      
    21    The fifth ground relates to the failure of the appellant to give evidence. His Honour gave this direction: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “I want to say something now briefly about the election of the accused not to give evidence on oath in court. The accused had a choice whether or not to give evidence on oath in the witness box. He chose, as was his legal right, not to do so. If he had given evidence on oath in the witness box he would have been open to cross-examination by Madam Crown, just as the witnesses called by the Crown were open to cross-examination by Mr Jauncey on behalf of the accused. 
         
        
        
         
         No adverse inference can be drawn against the accused because he chose not to give evidence on oath in the witness box. The accused does not have to prove anything. He is presumed to be innocent until such time as the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         On the other hand, ladies and gentlemen, the accused has not on oath in court denied or sought to explain any particular piece of evidence in the prosecution case. The accused is entitled to argue, as Mr Jauncey has done on his behalf, that you could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty on a consideration of the whole of the evidence put before you in the Crown case, and taking into account the accused’s denials in the record of interview which, as I say, was not on oath. However, ladies and gentlemen, it is proper to bear in mind that it is usually easier to accept evidence given on oath which is not contradicted on oath than it is in respect of evidence which is actively disputed by evidence on oath. Whether that is so in this case is a matter for you to consider. You must decide the case on the evidence which has been given, affording it such weight as you think it should have.” 
         
        
       
      
    22    The submission is made that the direction in those terms amounted to telling the jury that they would be “more comfortable with a finding of guilt”. The direction was in accord with the guidance available in Weissensteiner v The Queen 1993 178 CLR 217. The submission by the appellant included an assertion that his Honour was not entitled to suggest that a failure to deny the allegations on oath was of itself a matter which reflected on the issue of guilt or innocence. I agree. As the above extract shows his Honour said no such thing. It is clear that his Honour avoided any suggestion that the jury might regard the failure to give evidence as an implied admission of guilt. It is undeniably correct that it is usually easier to accept evidence which is uncontradicted and it bespeaks no error on the part of a trial judge to draw that to the attention of a jury. 
     
      
       
      
    23    The sixth ground effectively sought to draw support from the preceding grounds in combination. On the basis that the evidence of recognition of the appellant from viewing the security camera photographs was admissible, this is a case in which the remaining issue is the adequacy of that evidence. I have already mentioned the circumstance that the jury were advantaged by direct observation of three things: the witnesses who claimed that they recognized the appellant; the photographs taken by the security cameras and the appellant himself. I am unpersuaded that the convictions were unreasonable and I am of opinion that there was ample evidence in support of them.  
     
      
       
      
    24    I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed.

     REGINA v LEE WEST  
      
    Reasons for judgment3     HIDDEN J: The appellant, Lee West, was tried in the District Court with another man upon an indictment containing two charges: (1) robbery with corporal violence at the St George Bank at Ramsgate on 5 December 1997; and (2) on the same day, knowingly being carried in a Holden Commodore sedan which had been taken without its owner’s consent.  
     
      
       
       He was found guilty of both charges and custodial sentences were imposed. He appeals against conviction only. 
        
        
       The evidence 
        
       
      
    4     In the early afternoon of Friday, 5 December 1997 two men entered the St George Bank at Ramsgate Road, Ramsgate. One remained in the customer area while the other jumped over the counter, struck one of the tellers and seized a sum of money. The two men left the bank and were seen to drive away in the vehicle the subject of the second count, which was parked nearby and in which someone already occupied the driver’s seat. 
     
      
       
      
    5     The only issue at the trial was whether the appellant and his co-accused had been correctly identified as the men involved in the robbery. The appellant was said to be the man who had remained in the customer area of the bank. The witnesses to the robbery and the escape of the two men were shown arrays of photographs prepared by the police on video-tape. One of the tellers identified a photograph of the co-accused as the man who had jumped over the counter. Otherwise, none of the witnesses could identify either of the two men. However, the robbery was filmed by a bank security camera, and a number of police officers who had had prior contact with the appellant and his co-accused identified them in those photographs. This was the evidence upon which the case against the appellant turned. 
     
      
       
      
    6     The appellant gave no evidence and called no witnesses. However, he relied upon an electronically recorded interview conducted after his arrest, in which he denied any knowledge of the robbery and asserted that he was not in Sydney at the time. His case was developed though cross-examination of the police officers to whom I have referred, questioning the reliability of their identification of him in the bank security photographs.  
     
      
       
      
    7     The officer in charge of the investigation was Senior Constable Lynch. It was his evidence that in the afternoon of 8 December 1997, three days after the robbery, he obtained one of the bank security photographs. He immediately recognised the appellant as one of the men in it. He had spoken to him some months earlier, on 30 April 1997, at Glebe Police Station, although his evidence did not disclose how long he was in his company. He had also seen the appellant earlier on 8 December at the intersection of Elizabeth and Liverpool Streets Sydney, near the Downing Centre court complex. 
     
      
       
      
    8     When the appellant was at Glebe Police Station on 30 April, he was also seen by Detective Sergeant Lynch (apparently no relation to Senior Constable Lynch), Detective Senior Constable Porter and Senior Constable Shoobridge. Detective Senior Constable Porter said that he saw the appellant during the afternoon and the evening of that day, as did Detective Sergeant Lynch. Senior Constable Shoobridge said that he was in the appellant’s company for several hours. Detective Sergeant Lynch saw him again on three separate occasions during 7 August. He also saw him in the vicinity of the Downing Centre courts on the morning of 8 December. Detective Senior Constable Porter and Senior Constable Shoobridge were also at the Downing Centre that day and both saw the appellant inside the court building.  
     
      
       
      
    9     On 9 December, again at the Downing Centre, Senior Constable Lynch showed the bank security camera photograph to the other three police officers. Each gave evidence that he immediately recognised one of the men depicted as the appellant. Before the jury there was no evidence about the circumstances in which the appellant came to be at Glebe Police Station on 30 April or was seen by Detective Sergeant Lynch on 7 August. However, there was evidence that on 8 and 9 December he was at the Downing Centre as a defence witness in a trial which was then in progress. 
     
      
       
      
    10     By 12 December a number of further bank security photographs had been developed. On that day, Senior Constable Lynch showed all the photographs to Constable Carrick, who was stationed at Redfern. He gave evidence that he recognised the appellant in them. He said that he had seen and spoken to the appellant in the Redfern area a number of times during 1997. He also gave no evidence of the circumstances of those encounters, except to say that on several of those occasions he gave the appellant traffic infringement notices. 
     
      
       
      
    11     The other police officers were also shown the other photographs but, of course, the significant evidence was their recognition of the appellant in the single photograph which each of them was shown on 9 December. 
     
      
       
        
       The appeal 
        
       
      
    12     The primary ground of appeal was that the evidence of the police officers’ identification of the appellant from the bank security camera photographs should have been excluded. This appeal was heard together with two others, in which it was argued that evidence of this kind is inadmissible for the same reasons as were advanced in the present case. One of those cases was R v Mundarra Smith [1999] NSWCCA 317 and Sheller JA dealt with the argument at paragraphs 12 to 24 of his judgment in that case, rejecting it. I respectfully agree with what his Honour has written and there is no need to repeat it here. 
     
      
       
      
    13     As in Smith, it was also argued on the present case that the trial judge ought to have excluded the evidence on the basis that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant: s137 Evidence Act 1995. Clearly, there was a danger of prejudice arising from the fact that the identifying witnesses were police officers, although the evidence was led in such a way as to minimise that prejudice as far as it could be. Nevertheless, its probative value was high. In determining to admit the evidence, the learned trial judge performed the balancing exercise required by s137 and I am not persuaded that he fell into error in his approach to the matter. This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
       
      
    14     There was also a ground of appeal that the jury’s verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence. However, this ground was pressed only if the previous ground were successful, in which event there would clearly be insufficient evidence to support the convictions. That being so, this ground also must fail. 
     
      
       
      
    15     I would propose that the appeal be dismissed.

    The appellant was found guilty of robbery from a bank and sentenced to a minimum term of 3 years and 10 months penal servitude.During the trial evidence of several police officers who had identified the appellant from still pictures developed from the bank’s security camera film was admitted.The appellant appealed on the grounds that the identification evidence from the police officers should have been excluded because it was opinion evidence of a kind which a jury should not have taken into consideration in criminal proceedings, and that the conviction was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence.Held:By Sheller JA, Grove and Hidden JJ agreeing:(1) If a distinction must be made between fact and opinion evidence it could only be one of degree, calling for a decision as to whether, on a continuum which was unmarked and for which there was no exact measure, particular testimony had past the point where it had become evidence of an opinion.(2) The question posed by s76 of the Evidence Act 1995 did not require a determination which started by dividing evidence between evidence of opinion and evidence of fact. The question was whether particular evidence was evidence of an opinion within the meaning of the section.(3) To a witness who knew a person well enough to recognise that person on sight, there was no more inference involved in recognising that person as the person whose face was shown in a photograph than there was in recognising the same person when meeting him in the street. The evidence may be mistaken in either case, but even so it remained direct evidence of the fact that the person shown in the photograph or met in the street was a particular person.(5) The evidence given by the police officers was not evidence of opinion but was direct evidence that a person shown in the photograph was the accused. As such it was not excluded by s76 of the Evidence Act.LegislationEvidence Act 1995

     REGINA v Mundarra SMITH 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    SHELLER JA: The appellant, Mundarra Smith, was indicted on 27 August 1998 before her Honour Judge Latham at the Sydney District Court on the charge that on 26 June 1997 at Caringbah, being in company with others, he robbed Bradley Michael Street and Lara Christina Phelan and others of the sum of $16,600 in money, the property of the National Australia Bank Limited. The appellant pleaded not guilty and was tried before her Honour and a jury of eleven in a joint trial with Jason Wayne Nicholas. 
     
      
    2    On 1 September 1998 the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 29 April 1999 the appellant was sentenced for the offence to a minimum term of three years and ten months penal servitude to date from 24 January 1999 and to expire on 23 November 2002 and an additional term of three years and two months to commence on 24 November 2002 and expire on 23 January 2006. The sentences were to be served concurrently with other sentences imposed by her Honour on the same date. 
     
      
    3    In summary, the Crown case was that at about 12.25 pm on 26 June 1997 four males entered the National Australia Bank at Caringbah. One jumped the counter and struggled with a bank officer before pushing him out of the way. The offender said he had a gun and ordered the bank employees on to the floor. The offender opened the staff door letting in two other males, one of whom, allegedly the appellant, stayed on the customer side of the bank acting as a lookout and waiting near the front door. The security screens activated and the offenders who were in the staff area yelled at the tellers to open the cash drawers. They also tried to force the drawers open with a screw driver. After money had been removed, the four left the bank, fleeing to a stolen Commodore station-wagon. 
     
      
    4    Still pictures were developed and enlarged from the bank’s security camera film. Photographs depicted a male standing near the door, dressed in a hooded jacket. On 4 July 1997 police officers viewed some of the photographs and identified the appellant as the person near the door. Police later showed bank employees and other witnesses of the robbery a video compilation of males faces, including the appellant but none identified the appellant. 
     
      
    5    On 24 July 1997 police spoke to the appellant at Redfern police station where he took part in an interview, which was electronically recorded, and agreed to take part in an identification parade, which was not held. He was charged that day. 
     
      
    6    At the beginning of the trial the Crown indicated it wished to tender photographs taken by the bank’s security camera of the four persons in the bank and evidence of police officers, Constable Crampton who recognised the appellant in two of the photographs he was shown, Constable Peterson who recognised the appellant in two of the photographs he was shown and Constable Trevallion, who recognised the co-accused in two of the photographs he was shown. The Crown also put in evidence a photograph of the appellant at the time of his arrest. The appellant was present in court during the course of his trial. The Crown said that apart from that evidence there was little other evidence connecting the appellant with the crime. 
     
      
    7    On 31 August 1998 an application was made that the evidence of the police officers should be excluded in reliance upon ss135 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act). Section 137 provides that in a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.  
     
      
    8    Counsel for the co-accused Nicholas isolated six aspects of the identification evidence which taken together, he submitted, weakened its probative value to the extent that it was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Those six aspects were: 
     
      
       
        
        1. That Constable Trevallion’s identification occurred in a police station from photographs so that the accused had no opportunity to observe and therefore test the identification process. 
        
       
       
        
        2. That the identification was a manifestation of an inherent predisposition in a police officer to identify a person known to him. 
        
       
       
        
        3. That the identification was not based on any specific feature of Nicholas. 
        
       
       
        
        4. That only two photos were the subject of the identification and that the view of the accused’s face in these two photos was limited. 
        
       
       
        
        5. That no explanation had been given to the apparent failure to show the photos to other police who had worked with Constable Trevallion. 
        
       
       
        
        6. That to test the identification evidence his cross-examination would necessarily reveal his client’s prior association with police. 
        
       
      
    9    Counsel for the appellant adopted those submissions and in addition relied upon s76 of the Act to submit that the constables concerned were really giving lay opinion evidence. Counsel further submitted that s78 did not render it admissible. 
     
      
    10    In the circumstances, Judge Latham was not persuaded that the prejudicial effect of the identification evidence outweighed its probative value. In reaching that conclusion her Honour said she was mindful of the capacity of directions to minimise any prejudice flowing to the accused from the fact that they were apparently well known to police officers who worked at Redfern in the relevant period. The probative value of the evidence on the other hand was high.  
     
      
    11    To the extent that the identification evidence suffered from the frailties referred to in aspects 3 and 4 her Honour said these could be cured by the appropriate directions or warnings. Assuming for the purposes of argument that the evidence of the police officers could be characterised as opinion evidence, her Honour concluded that it was evidence which came within s78 of the Act and that accordingly it was admissible. 
     
      
    12    The evidence of the police officers was admitted and the appellant convicted. The appellant appeals on two grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The identification evidence from the police officers should have been excluded. This was opinion evidence of a kind which the jury should not have taken into consideration in criminal proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The convictions were unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence. 
        
       
      
    13    Mr Austin, who appeared for the appellant, began his argument by taking the Court to the definition of “identification evidence” in Pt 1 of the dictionary to the Act. Relevantly identification evidence means evidence that is an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted was committed or an act connected to that offence was done at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that was based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw or heard at that place and time. Evidence by a witness identifying a person in a photograph to be a person the witness knows clearly does not fall within this definition. The result is that Pt 3.9 “Identification evidence”, and in particular s115 “Exclusion of evidence of identification by pictures”, does not apply. 
     
      
    14    Next counsel submitted that, since the evidence was not identification evidence as defined, the evidence could only be admitted in accordance with the opinion rule, that is to say s76. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed.” 
        
       
      
    15    Before coming to consider the application of that section and statutory exceptions to it in ss77-80, it is helpful to consider what is meant in this Part of the Act by the expression “Evidence of an opinion” or, perhaps, what the expression does not embrace. 
     
      
    16    To characterise as evidence of an opinion a witness’s testimony that he recognises a person shown in a photograph as a person he knows presents an obvious problem. Logically, what is the difference between that evidence and that witness’s evidence that he recognises somebody he met in the street as a person he knows? If a witness is shown a studio photograph of his spouse, who lives with the witness, and gives evidence that the person shown in the photograph is the witness’s spouse, commonsense and common use of language would not treat that as an expression or evidence of opinion but as direct evidence of the fact: “that is a photograph of my wife”. Compare R v Palmer (1981) 1 NSWLR 209 at 213. 
     
      
    17    In the context of the rule, which has traditionally excluded opinion evidence, any useful definition of “opinion” has proved difficult. In R W Miller & Co Pty Limited v Krupp (Australia) Pty Limited (1991) 34 NSWLR 129 at 130 Giles J, as his Honour then was, observed that the distinction between fact and opinion, and what is opinion evidence, are not particularly clear, “but for present purposes I think opinion evidence can be described as evidence of a conclusion, usually judgmental or debatable, reasoned from facts.” Typically a person of a particular skill or training, such as a medical practitioner, will give evidence based on history, symptoms and examination about the health of a patient. That is understood as opinion evidence based on factual material or on assumptions consisting of history, symptoms and the results of examination. In Allstate Life Insurance Co Limited v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (No 5) (1996) 64 FCR 73 at 75 Lindgren J, referring to the opinion rule in the Evidence Act of the Commonwealth, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The expression ‘opinion’ is not defined in the Act. In the context of the general law of evidence, ‘opinion’ has been defined as ‘an inference from observed and communicable data’: J D Chadbourn (Ed), 
          
        Wigmore on Evidence, 
          
        (1978), vol 7, para 1917; and see Cross on Evidence (5th Australian Edition, 1996), p 782 para 29010; Australian Law Reform Commission, Interim Report on Evidence (ALRC 26, 1985), vol 2, pp 168-169 para 96.” 
        
       
      
    18    In the edition of Wigmore referred to at para 1919 the author makes the point that no distinction between “opinion” testimony and “fact” testimony is scientifically possible.  
     
      
       
        
        “We may in ordinary conversation roughly group distinct domains for ‘opinion’ on the one hand and ‘fact’ or ‘knowledge’ on the other; but as soon as we come to analyse and define these terms for the purpose of that accuracy which is necessary in legal rulings, we find that the distinction vanishes, that a flux ensues, and that nearly everything which we choose to call ‘fact’ either is or may be only ‘opinion’ or inference.” 
        
       
      
    19    If a distinction must be made it can only be one of degree, calling for a decision as to whether, on a continuum which is unmarked and for which there is no exact measure, particular testimony has past the point where it has become evidence of an opinion. In a passage which Wigmore quoted as “the most careful attempt to justify the distinction”, Sir George Cornewall Lewis in Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion 1 (1849) gave the following guide: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is true that even the simplest sensations involve some judgment; when a witness reports that he saw an object of a certain shape and size or at a certain distance, he describes something more than a mere impression on his sense of sight, and his statement implies a theory and explanation of a bare phenomenon. When, however, the judgment is of so simple a kind as to become wholly unconscious, and the interpretation of the appearances as a matter of general agreement, the object of sensation may, for our present purpose, be considered a fact.” 
        
       
      
    20    In Cross, 5th Australian edition, at 781 and following the learned editor emphasises the attractive but deceptive simplicity of the proposition that witnesses must state facts not opinions. At para 29015 it is said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the distinction between facts and inference is clear enough, the evidence given by a witness is neither fact nor inference. What the witness utters in each case is a statement about a fact or series of facts. These facts have been processed through the witness’ mind via perception, classification, recollection and utterance. ……it will be recognised that statements concerning speed, or temperature, or the identity of persons, things and handwriting are indissolubly composed of fact and inference. The law makes allowance for these borderline cases by permitting witnesses to state their opinion with regard to matters not calling for special knowledge whenever it would be virtually impossible for them to separate their inferences from the facts on which those inferences are based.” 
        
       
      
    21    The question posed by s76 does not require a determination which starts by dividing evidence between evidence of opinion and evidence of fact. The question is whether particular evidence is evidence of an opinion within the meaning of the section. The appellant’s submission is that the police officer giving evidence about the photograph was doing no more than infer identity from observed and communicable data.  
     
      
    22    It is not difficult to see that evidence about what a photograph shows may involve using a special knowledge to draw an inference from what can be seen in the photograph. But, to a witness who knows a person well enough to recognise that person on sight, there is no more inference involved in recognising that person as the person whose face is shown in a photograph than there is in recognising the same person when meeting that person in the street. The evidence may be mistaken in either case, for example, if the person recognised is an identical twin. But even so it remains direct evidence of the fact that the person shown in the photograph or met in the street is a particular person.  
     
      
    23    The dangers of reliance on identification evidence are well known; see Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555 particularly at 560 and following. But evidence of the sort here under consideration proceeds on the basis that the witness had previously known the person identified well enough to recognise that person on sight and then looked at a photograph and given evidence about what the photograph showed. The clarity or otherwise of the photograph and the resemblance of the person depicted to the person recognised is there for the jury to see. That is not to say that there are not dangers but the weaknesses of the recognition are more exposed and to that extent the dangers reduced. It is quite different from the photo identification procedure by which someone who has seen a suspected offender but cannot put a name to him is shown photographs of persons known to others, usually the police, and by recognising one of them as the suspected offender, identifies him; compare Alexander v The Queen (1981) 145 CLR 395. 
     
      
    24    The evidence given by the police officers was not evidence of an opinion but was direct evidence that a person shown in the photograph was the accused. As such it was not excluded by s76 of the Act. Accordingly, there is no need to consider the application of s78 or other statutory exceptions to the opinion rule. 
     
      
    25    The appellant’s counsel submitted that the trial Judge should in her discretion have excluded the police evidence about the photographs. Counsel relied on the six matters put to the trial Judge which I have listed and additionally upon what was said to be the danger of jury members substituting the opinion of the witness for their own. But nothing was put to demonstrate any error in her Honour’s exercise of discretion; see House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-5. Her Honour paid due regard to the various matters put to her and exercised her discretion accordingly. It was well open to her Honour to conclude that the probative value of the police evidence about the photographs outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant; compare ss135 and 137 of the Act. In my opinion, the first ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    26    On the second ground the appellant submitted that the photographs relied upon were not of a quality capable of basing an identification. This argument did not rise above assertion. The Crown submitted that the photographs were of sufficient quality to be admissible. No argument developed before us persuades me that the convictions were unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence. In my opinion, this ground of appeal also fails and accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed.

     JUDGMENT 
    1     HIDDEN J: I will try and pace this so that the interpreter can interpret, as I give my reasons. 
     
      
       
      
    2     The appellant, Paul Phuoc Duoc Nguyen, was tried in the Parramatta District Court before his Honour Judge Johnston, sitting without a jury, upon a charge of manslaughter. He also pleaded guilty to two charges of maliciously discharging a firearm with intent to avoid lawful apprehension, and a charge of detaining for advantage, perhaps more conveniently known as kidnapping. 
     
      
       
      
    3     When he came for sentence, he also asked that six further charges of discharging a firearm with intent to avoid lawful apprehension be taken into account on a Form 1. All the charges arise from the same incident. His Honour found the appellant guilty of manslaughter. On that charge, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, he sentenced the appellant to penal servitude for ten years, comprising a minimum term of six years and an additional term of four years. 
     
      
       
      
    4     On the other charges to which he had pleaded guilty he sentenced the applicant to penal servitude for fixed terms of four years, to be served concurrently. All sentences were to date from the date of his arrest, 20 March 1996. 
     
      
       
      
    5     The applicant appeals against his conviction on the charge of manslaughter and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences. 
     
      
       
      
    6     Turning firstly to the manslaughter charge, shortly stated the facts, as his Honour found them, were these. The appellant had been in a relationship with Juliana Chan, the daughter of the deceased. A son was born of that relationship, which terminated in the early 1990s. There had been financial dealings between the appellant, on the one hand, and Juliana Chan and her brother, Andy Chan, on the other. The appellant claimed that Juliana Chan and her brother owed him a substantial amount of money. 
     
      
       
      
    7     On the occasion in question, 20 March 1996, the appellant went to a house at Burwood where Juliana Chan lived with her mother. Also living at the home were Andy Chan, and a sister of Andy and Juliana, Atta Chan. His Honour found that the appellant went to the home intending to confront Juliana and Andy Chan in relation to the money said to be owing. He was armed, among other things, with a rifle. He tied up the deceased, Wai Chan, and gagged her. Later, Atta Chan arrived at the house, and he also tied her up. Atta Chan observed that her mother was bound and gagged and was motionless. 
     
      
       
      
    8     It is unnecessary to recount in any great detail what it was Atta Chan observed, but her evidence was of considerable significance in the Crown case. She managed to escape and to alert police. 
     
      
       
      
    9     Later, when police arrived, there was what his Honour described as a “siege situation”, and it was the events at that time which gave rise to the offences to which the appellant pleaded guilty, and the offences on the Form 1. 
     
      
       
      
    10     After police gained access to the house, the deceased was attended to by an ambulance officer. It was apparent that she had been dead for some hours. Dr Lawrence, forensic pathologist, later attended the premises. It was Dr Lawrence's opinion that the primary cause of the death of the deceased was asphyxiation. Although no gag was found after police and others gained access to the premises, the doctor’s observations were consistent with a gag having been applied. 
     
      
       
      
    11     The deceased had also sustained broken ribs. That was consistent with two possible causes. The one which his Honour favoured was that the ribs were broken while the deceased was lying face down and was being bound from behind. The deceased had also sustained a perforated eardrum, and his Honour was satisfied that that was the result of a blow struck by the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    12     In the light of the whole of the evidence and, in particular, the evidence of Atta Chan and Dr Lawrence, his Honour concluded that the deceased had died of asphyxia caused by the gag, and exacerbated by the fractured ribs in the course of her being bound from behind. Accordingly, he concluded that the deceased died as a result of unlawful and dangerous acts perpetrated by the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    13     It is convenient at this stage to outline briefly the facts giving rise to the other charges. It is sufficient to say that there was a siege situation when police arrived but, eventually, police decided to force entry to the house. When they did so there was an exchange of gunfire. One police officer received minor wounds from shell fragments, and the appellant himself was shot in the right arm. 
     
      
       
      
    14     Before us the appellant has been unrepresented. He has relied on a number of documents previously filed with the Registry. I should set out what they are. There is a document dated 6 August 1998. There is a further document dated 22 January 1999, which sets out what are said to be grounds of appeal. There is yet another undated document headed ""Submission to the Registrar, Court of Criminal Appeal"". 
     
      
       
      
    15     Today the appellant supplied further documents, by way of submission, together with a number of annexures. Much of the material supplied today relates to the financial dispute between the appellant and Juliana Chan and her brother, and it is sufficient to say that that issue simply has no bearing whatsoever upon anything which his Honour had to decide or which we have to decide. 
     
      
       
      
    16     I believe I do the appellant’s written material justice by saying that his complaints in this appeal are set out in the document of 22 January 1999, and the other material is repetitive of the matters which he has there set out. That is the document containing a number of paragraphs described as “Grounds of Appeal”, and I shall refer to those paragraphs by the numbers which they bear. 
     
      
       
      
    17     Several of those grounds relate only to the siege and its aftermath. Paragraph 1 complains of the failure of the appellant's legal representatives at the trial to call a number of police involved in the siege and the arrest, and doctors who treated the appellant at hospital. Paragraph 2 complains of the excessive use of force by the police in the course of the arrest. Paragraph 8(b) asserts that the appellant did not himself shoot at the police, although he concedes having fired the weapon. Paragraph 8(c) complains of the violent manner of the police entry in the house. 
     
      
       
      
    18     As to all those matters, it is sufficient to say that they relate to the offences to which the appellant pleaded guilty. Some of them are really complaints about the police in respects which could not bear upon the appellant's guilt; and, indeed, the undated document headed Submission to the Registrar reveals that the appellant has made a complaint to the Ombudsman about the police behaviour that night. To make such a complaint is of course entirely within his right, but that is not a matter with which this Court could deal. 
     
      
       
      
    19     Paragraph 8(a) complains of a suggestion in the evidence that the appellant kept his small son hostage at the house. It seems that the son was at the house on the occasion but, as I understand it, there was no suggestion that the boy was being used as a hostage. Certainly there was no charge to that effect, and it is not a finding that his Honour made. That does not appear to me to be a matter of any materiality in the appeal.  
     
      
       
      
    20     Paragraph 7, however, is of more significance. It reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The miss translation in court: The copy of my charges given to me by solicitor differed from the copy which the judge received. Therefore when I was asked to plead on each charge, these did not correspond to my copy. During court proceedings I was not aware of this difference. 
         
        
       
       
        
       The appellant has not produced any evidence to support that assertion in this Court. On the other hand, we have been supplied with a copy of written submissions prepared by the appellant’s solicitor which, on their face, make it apparent that they were explained to the appellant by an interpreter. They are instructions to the effect that the appellant wished to plead guilty to the very charges to which he did plead guilty, and they appear to leave no room for any assertion that he misunderstood what those charges were. 
        
       
      
    21     Putting aside the question of sentence for a moment, the other paragraphs of the document containing the grounds of appeal relate to the conviction of manslaughter. Paragraph 4 contains a number of assertions. There is reference to “the doctor who treated my mother-in-law for a serious medical condition”, and the ground of his complaint is that that was a matter that was not satisfactorily agitated at the trial. It is sufficient to say that Dr Lawrence considered that the deceased may have had a heart condition, but there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that any existing medical condition could have accounted for her death. 
     
      
       
      
    22     There is a further request that an independent post-mortem be carried out upon the deceased. That of course is quite impossible at this stage. A post-mortem was conducted by Dr Lawrence, as one would expect in the ordinary course. 
     
      
       
      
    23     There is a complaint that there should have been an expert analysis of the toxic effects of stun and flash grenades used by the police. In that regard, there is a further complaint in paragraph 9 that Dr Lawrence was not an expert in the use or effect of the stun grenades used by the police. Dr Lawrence did give evidence that he considered the deceased’s perforated eardrum could not have been caused by a grenade but, in any event, the matter is of no moment, because what is clear is that the deceased had been dead well before the police arrived. No action taken by the police could possibly have contributed to her death. 
     
      
       
      
    24     Paragraph 6 contains the somewhat unattractive assertion that the deceased might have been saved if she had been treated earlier. The appellant alleges that Atta Chan did nothing to help her mother, and that the police indeed might have saved her life if they had arrived earlier and entered the house at an earlier stage. On the evidence, it is quite impossible to imagine what Atta Chan or the police could have done for the unfortunate deceased. In any event, these are matters of no moment. All that matters is that the death of the deceased was the result of an act or acts of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    25     Paragraph 10 raises the question of the deceased having been moved after the police enter the premises. The evidence is that indeed she was, by an ambulance officer, but absolutely nothing turns on this. 
     
      
       
      
    26     Finally, paragraph 3 is an assertion that the conviction for manslaughter is unreasonable. That assertion simply cannot be sustained. There was more than adequate evidence that the death of the deceased was the result of the unlawful and dangerous acts of the appellant. 
     
      
       
      
    27     The appellant's evidence at the trial, in which he sought to explain the circumstances of his arrival at the home and what he did when he got there was, quite frankly, bordering on the fanciful. His Honour said of that evidence : 
     
      
       
        
         
         I found the accused to be a most unimpressive witness, and his version of events most imaginative to the point of being beyond belief. 
         
        
       
      
    28     Those observations were entirely justified. In my view the appeal against conviction on the manslaughter charge should be dismissed.  
     
      
       
      
    29     The application for leave to appeal against sentence can be dealt with fairly briefly. It is unnecessary to say anything more about the facts of the various offences. 
     
      
       
      
    30     His Honour had regard to the appellant's subjective case. He is a mature man, now in his mid 40s. He was born and educated in Vietnam. He completed high school and, in due course, became an officer in the South Vietnamese Army where he served for a number of years. He saw active service during the war in that country. After the surrender he escaped to Malaysia, where he spent some time at a refugee camp before coming to this country. 
     
      
       
      
    31     In this country he had various labouring jobs until he launched his own business, which was successful. Clearly, in that account, which the appellant expanded upon somewhat today orally, there is much to his credit. He has no criminal convictions. A psychological report before his Honour revealed that there is no need to be concerned about his mental stability. It seems that he has the continuing support of his family in this country. 
     
      
       
      
    32     That said, the offences are very serious indeed. His Honour arrived at the effective sentence of penal servitude for ten years with an eye to the totality of the criminality involved in all the offences arising out of this incident. His Honour gave the appellant the benefit of a finding of special circumstances so as to reduce what would otherwise have been the minimum term calculated according to the normal statutory proportion. I can see no error in the manner in which his Honour approached the sentencing task, and by no stretch of the imagination could the effective sentence be said to be excessive. 
     
      
       
      
    33     Given the unusual nature of the case and its circumstances, I would be minded to grant leave to appeal but would also dismiss the appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    34     SULLY J: I agree with the orders proposed by my brother Hidden J and for the reasons that his Honour gives. 
     
      
       
      
    35     HULME J: I also agree with the orders proposed, and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
       
      
    36     SULLY J: The Court orders: 
     
      
       
        
       1. That the appeal against conviction be dismissed. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       2. That leave be granted to appeal against sentence.  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       3. That the appeal against sentence be dismissed.

    No: 70081/98 REGINA v Dean Anthony PRIVETT No: 70014/97 REGINA v Michael PRIVETT SENTENCING JUDGMENT1    HIS HONOUR: On 3 August 1999 a jury found Dean Anthony Privett and Michael Privett guilty of the murder of Dr Peter Browne Rowland at Gundaroo on 25 June 1996. At their request, both were remanded for sentence to 8 October 1999; and at the conclusion of the sentencing proceedings on that day, I remanded them until today, in order to give the matter adequate consideration.  
     
      
    2    The sentencing process is founded on well established principles which for present purposes I can conveniently take from the judgment of Allen J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Finlay J agreed) in Regina v Camilleri (8 February 1990, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported): 
     
      
       
        
        In seeking to determine in any case the sentence appropriate to a particular crime it is always of importance to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively. Unless that is done the other facts requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence cannot be given their rightful place. A sentence imposed must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime in the sense that it should, having regard to the all the proved circumstances, accord with the general moral sense of the community. It should also serve as a sufficient deterrent both to the offender and to others. The purpose of that deterrence is to prevent the commission of such offences, and whilst justice and humanity require that the previous character and conduct and the probable future life and conduct of the individual offender should be given most careful consideration, those are factors which are necessarily subsidiary to the main consideration which determines the appropriate amount of punishment, that is the protection of the public. The fundamental purpose of punishment is the protection of society. Unless those basic principles of sentencing are adhered to, errors will occur. 
        
       
      
    3    Although for the purpose of sentencing the jury's verdicts conclusively establish the guilt of each prisoner, those verdicts do not identify the “proved circumstances” adequately for the sentencing task. In particular, the verdicts do not reveal upon which of several available bases the guilt of each prisoner arose.  
     
      
    4    In those circumstances, the law imposes on me, as the sentencing judge, the task of determining the facts upon which I should act in imposing sentence, that is, of determining the basis and measure of the criminal responsibility of each prisoner respectively. In so doing, I must of course accept the jury's verdicts and must make no finding of fact which is not consistent with those verdicts.  
     
      
    5    It is important that I observe, and that those who listen to or read what I say today should clearly understand, that in sentencing I may proceed only on the basis of facts proved against each prisoner beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    6    On the night of his death, Dr Rowland was at his property near Gundaroo. A house was in course of construction but not yet habitable. A shed on the property had been set up as a temporary residence, and in that shed Dr Rowland had gone to bed. He had a bedside light on; he may have been reading or he may have dozed off. He woke when his killer burst into the shed. He sat up, saying words to the effect, ""What's going on?"", and the killer fired a single shot from a twelve gauge shotgun which struck Dr Rowland in the face causing almost instant death. Four other shots were fired, two of which struck and killed Dr Rowland's large dog which was near the foot of the bed. The other two shots were evidently also fired at the dog, but missed.  
     
      
    7    Before I proceed to more specific findings of fact, I remind myself of the warning I gave to the jury as to the need for caution in acting upon the evidence of the witnesses Spencer and Teale, who were themselves criminally involved in that events of that evening, and the direction as to the need to scrutinise their evidence carefully. So too, I must be cautious about the evidence by either accused against the other, especially the evidence of Michael Privett implicating Dean as the gunman, contrary to his first assertion to police that it was he, not Dean, who killed their victim. I have given great weight to that warning and have scrutinised their evidence with great care. Having done so, I have concluded that I may act upon their evidence, as clearly the jury did, although to the extent that the evidence of Michael Privett was self-serving, attempting to minimise his own guilt, I do not accept it.  
     
      
    8    The evidence establishes that earlier that evening, Dean Privett arranged with one Gary Teale, that Teale should drive Privett to one or more rural properties for the purpose of stealing items of value including, if possible, one or more generators for which Dean had a potential buyer. They drove first to a property known as Yass Plains in Dogtrap Road, Yass. Entry to the property was blocked by a chained gate. They returned to Yass where Dean Privett borrowed some boltcutters. The two men then went to Dean Privett's home, and there Michael Privett and a fourth man Byron Spencer joined them in the car. They returned to Yass Plains, Dean cut the chain and opened the gate, and they entered the property and proceeded to a shed where all four men took an active part in collecting various tools, including some expensive power tools (but not a generator) and placing them in the boot of Teale's car. They transported those items back to Yass where they were secreted in the back yard of Dean Privett's home.  
     
      
    9    The vehicle was then driven from Dean Privett's home to Dr Rowland's property and in the minds of all who participated, the purpose of the trip was to find and steal a generator.  
     
      
    10    Dean Privett denies that he was in the vehicle on this second occasion, but the jury's verdicts imply their rejection of his evidence to that effect. In any event, independently of my duty to act consistently with the jury's verdicts, the evidence of Teale, Spencer and Michael Privett establishes to my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that Dean Privett was in the car and also, that he had with him in the car his twelve gauge shotgun and that, shortly before the vehicle arrived at Dr Rowland's property, Dean Privett loaded the weapon. The same evidence satisfies me that Dean Privett took the loaded gun with him when he got out of the car; that he was carrying it as he entered the shed after Michael Privett, at Dean's direction, kicked open the door; and that it was Dean Privett who fired the lethal shot.  
     
      
    11    The Crown submitted that it was open to me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killing of Dr Rowland was premeditated by both accused, the subject of a prior agreement between them that, should they find Dr Rowland on the premises, he should be killed. There is some support for that in the evidence, but such a finding could only be made by inference and, especially in the absence of any credible evidence of a motive on the part of Dean Privett to kill, and given the slender nature of the evidence of motive on the part of Michael (namely, his assertion to police that the doctor was killed because of his homosexuality - which, it should be noted, is not evidence against Dean), the evidence is insufficient to discharge the onus of proof of premeditation against either prisoner.  
     
      
    12    However, the evidence does lead to a finding beyond reasonable doubt against each of the prisoner's that they entered the premises with a hostile intent. The matters which lead to that conclusion include the following.  
     
      
    13    It is clear, and neither of the prisoner's counsel disputed, that both men were, from the outset, parties to a joint criminal enterprise to break and enter the property, and steal. It is clear beyond doubt that, at least from the moment he left the car carrying the loaded gun, Dean Privett had the intention of using it in pursuance of their common objective, that is using it to subdue and overcome any opposition from any person in occupation of the shed. It is equally clear that before he commenced to kick open the door, Michael Privett knew that Dean was carrying the loaded gun. The evidence satisfies me of that, quite apart from the fact that a finding to the contrary would be inconsistent with the jury's verdicts.  
     
      
    14    There were obvious signs that the building was occupied (a light on, and a vehicle parked directly outside). Michael Privett denies having seen the light on. I reject that evidence, but such rejection does not, of course, prove that he saw the light or, if he did, that he inferred the presence of a human occupant. However, the manner of their entry into the shed is very telling: it comes primarily from the mouth of Michael Privett himself in his police interviews and his sworn evidence at the trial, with some support from the evidence of Spencer and the findings of the scene of crime officer, Detective Turnbull. I find that on arrival at the property but before they left the car, Dean Privett directed Michael to kick the door down. That is what occurred. Michael Privett kicked the door open, and Dean, armed with the shotgun, ran into the lighted room. That manner of entry clearly bespeaks a belief that the shed was occupied, or at the very least, anticipation on the part of both men of a real possibility that the shed was occupied. The evidence satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that prior to the moment when Michael began his onslaught on the door, the scope of the mutually agreed enterprise had come to include the use of the firearm to overcome the resistance of any person who might be upon the premises - that is, the enterprise had become one of armed robbery.  
     
      
    15    All of the evidence satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that before he began to attack the door, Michael contemplated that there was a substantial risk that in the course of their committing armed robbery, his brother might discharge the gun (which would suffice to render Michael Privett guilty of felony murder); but more, that he contemplated that there was a substantial risk that his brother would fire the gun at any person present in the shed with the intention of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm. His evidence to the contrary is not credible. In so saying, I have not ignored the evidence of his extensive consumption of alcohol in the course of the day. However, in that regard I accept in preference to his sworn evidence his answer to question 287 in his first recorded interview: 
     
      
       
        
        Q: Where you intoxicated? 
        
       
       
        
        A: Some people would call me intoxicated but I wouldn't, I was still pretty coherent, I could understand everything. 
        
       
       
      Similarly, in respect of his possible affectation by drugs, I prefer his answers in that recorded interview, where he denied having used any drugs that day, to his subsequent self-serving accounts to the contrary.  
       
      
    16    I make that finding as to Michael Privett's contemplation because it appears to be warranted by the evidence; but I do so well aware that in terms of the ultimate sentence it may be of little consequence because, as the Court of Criminal Appeal pointed out in Regina v Mills (3 April 1995, unreported), felony murder is not necessarily to be regarded less seriously than murder done with the intention to kill.  
     
      
    17    I am satisfied that Dean Privett fired the shotgun at Dr Rowland with the intention of killing him. In the absence of any basis for a finding of premeditation, I do not find that that intention was formed before the time when the prisoner entered the shed, but that the intention existed at the time the shot was fired is a compelling inference from the fact the shot appears to have been an aimed shot, fired at a time when the muzzle of the gun was only some 100-180 millimetres (4-8 inches) from the victim's face, together with the fact that, before that shot was fired, Dr Rowland had raised himself from his pillow and spoken to the intruders.  
     
      
    18    I do not overlook Mr Young's submission that there is a theoretical possibility that the gun was fired in panic, not aimed; or that it was aimed away from the victim, but struck him by accident; that is, that there was no intention to kill so that the prisoners are guilty only on the basis of felony murder. Consistently with his denial of any involvement, it could hardly be expected that Dean Privett would give evidence that such is what occurred. The fact remains that, absent any such evidence, there is nothing to displace the obvious inference of an intention to kill. 
     
      
    19    I will briefly summarise my findings as to the objective circumstances of the killings and the objective criminality of each prisoner respectively. I find: 
     
      
       
      (1) that the killing was not premeditated; 
       
       
      (2) that what began as a joint enterprise to commit the crime of breaking, entering and stealing became a joint enterprise to commit either that crime or armed robbery as the circumstances dictated, that change occurring when the prisoners became aware of the possibility that the shed was occupied and Dean Privett took the loaded gun from the car to the shed. 
       
      
    20    As to Dean Privett I find further: 
     
      
       
      (3) that he intended to use the gun if necessary to subdue any person who was found in the premises and to overcome any opposition to their criminal purpose; and 
       
       
      (4) that in fact he fired the gun at Dr Rowland from close range with the intention of killing him. 
       
      
    21    As to Michael Privett I find further that he was alive to the substantial risk that, in the course of their joint criminal enterprise, Dean might discharge the shotgun and might do so with intent to kill.  
     
      
    22    Punishment for murder is prescribed by s19A of the Crimes Act 1900 which, as now relevant, provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1 A person who commits the crime of murder is liable to penal servitude for life. 
        
       
       
        
        2 A person sentenced to penal servitude for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person's natural life. 
        
       
       
        
        3 Nothing in this section affects the operation of s442 (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than penal servitude for life). 
        
       
      
    23    The imposition of the maximum penalty for any offence, including murder, is a sentencing option reserved for cases which can properly be characterised as falling within the worst category of cases for which that penalty is prescribed: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-2. In the course of the sentencing proceedings the Crown prosecutor conceded that this does not fall into the worst category of case for which the maximum penalty might be appropriate. In my view, that concession was properly and responsibly made. Nevertheless, the objective circumstances are such that this crime must be treated as a very serious one indeed. It involved the prisoners entering on a criminal activity in a relatively remote rural area. The residents of such locations are particularly vulnerable to theft and crimes of violence, and sentences imposed by courts in respect of offences committed in those circumstances must necessarily give considerable weight to the need for deterrence in order to protect such persons so far as the courts can do. The crime involved the carrying of a loaded firearm in the course of the criminal enterprise. In the case of Mills referred to earlier the sentencing judge, Wood J, said: 
     
      
       
        
        The offence of murder involved is one of felony murder arising out of the use of a shotgun in the course of an armed robbery. The use of a firearm in the commission of any form of offence is a circumstance which always calls for a heavy sentence; particularly is that so where it leads to the death of an entirely innocent shop attendant who, in this case, offered not the slightest resistance to the prisoner.  
        
       
       
      Those words which were expressly endorsed in the Court of Criminal Appeal are obviously applicable in the present circumstances. The crime did not involve premeditated killings, but the decision to carry the loaded gun was clearly made at a time when both men were alive to the possibility that the premises were occupied. No doubt each was emboldened by the liquor he had taken, for which reason perhaps they chose to proceed with their plan to force entry into the premises, despite the possibility that it was occupied - but disinhibition by reason of intoxication does not mitigate the seriousness of their offence. Clearly Dean Privett was ready to use the gun as necessary to overcome resistance, and Michael Privett well knew of the risk that he would do so.  
       
      
    24    So far as objective criminality is concerned, I conclude that the case is of a most serious nature, though falling short of such a case as would attract a maximum penalty. As between the two prisoners, I regard the criminality of Dean Privett as the greater in that he was, as I find, the instigator of the whole criminal enterprise, and was the one who saw fit to bring the weapon, to load it and, eventually, tragically, to fire it.  
     
      
    25    I turn then to consider, so far as the evidence goes, the previous character and conduct and the probable future life and conduct of each of the prisoners.  
     
      
    26    Dean Privett was born on 27 August 1968. Thus, he was almost twenty-eight at the date of the murder and is thirty-one years of age. He was educated to School Certificate level at Yass High School and then undertook a twelve month farm business management course at Yanco.  
     
      
    27    His father was employed as the manager of a property at Yass and Dean was employed from time to time on that property and in a local timber mill until 1986 when he sustained head injuries in a motor vehicle accident. He made a good recovery although, according to his mother, he was thereafter ""a little bit restless"". In any event, he was able to return to farm work and then to work in the field of landscape gardening. More recently, he has developed his own business as a concreting contractor and landscape gardener. From about 1984 to 1997 he was in a relationship with a young woman by whom he had two children. He has since been in another relationship but remains supportive of his first partner and their children. His mother described him as good tempered, calm and non-violent although she acknowledged, of course, his conviction for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm which, she said, occurred in the course of a family argument between him and his sister. His counsel was able to place before the Court a substantial number of very favourable references which show him to have been a pleasant young man, hardworking, diligent and trustworthy, and which demonstrate that his involvement in crimes of dishonesty and in a crime of hideous violence was foreign to his character as known to those with whom he associated. None of those who provided testimonials seems to have been aware of his minor criminal record which reveals convictions at age twenty-four for high level PCA and unlicensed driving, and cultivation of cannabis. As well, there is the assault on his sister in 1994, and a minor conviction in July 1998 on a charging of remaining on enclosed lands. That record does him no credit but is of little significance in this sentencing process and knowledge of it would probably not have affected the opinion held of him by those who have provided testimonials. He is entitled to be described as a person of generally good character and as a person for whom criminal activity of the kind which took place on 25 June prior to the killing and involvement in the killing itself were completely out of character. I am unable to find in the evidence any satisfactory explanation for his conduct on this particular occasion.  
     
      
    28    The strength of the favourable character evidence (which, incidentally, was not adduced before the jury at the trial) points strongly towards a finding that Dean Privett is unlikely to offend again after his release and that, notwithstanding that he will necessarily be out of the community for very many years, the probability is that he will be able to rehabilitate himself and reinstate himself in the good regard of the community in a relatively short time after his release. It does not appear to me that there is anything in the circumstances of his case which requires the adjustment of the length of the additional term of his sentence to provide for a longer than usual period on parole.  
     
      
    29    In the course of the sentencing proceedings Dean Privett asked that I should take into account, in sentencing for the crime of murder, the offence of break, enter and steal at Yass Plains in respect of which for the purpose of this sentencing procedure he admitted his guilt. The necessary documentation having been prepared, I will take that matter into account in determining the sentence to be imposed upon Dean Privett.  
     
      
    30    I shall also take into account the fact that he was in custody in respect of the charge of murder from 29 June 1996 to 18 September 1996, a period of almost three months. On 22 October 1998 he appeared before the Supreme Court upon the return of an ex officio indictment in respect of this matter. Bail was refused and he has been in continuous custody since. It is appropriate therefore that the sentence that I impose should be expressed to commence on 22 October 1998.  
     
      
    31    Michael Privett was born on 28 June 1967 so that he is now thirty-two years of age and was twenty-nine years of age at the date of the murder. Michael Privett is the fifth child in the family of seven. He appears to have had a troubled childhood and many behavioural problems which severely strained the relationship with his parents and siblings and interfered with his education. He was several times sent away by his parents to live with one or other of his older brothers; he had a series of placements in boys' homes from time to time; and on many occasions when he was at home he ran away. In his early teens, he began to abuse drugs including marijuana, cocaine and heroin, and alcohol. He has worked from time to time in casual labouring positions but has no record of regular employment. He is, according to him, ostracised from his birth family and I accept that that is the case. He has a long criminal record which reflects his troubled childhood and his inability since childhood to fit into society. In particular the record reflects his drug- and alcohol-ridden lifestyle. Numerous appearances before the Children's Court led to detention orders being made on several occasions. His adult court appearances, although numerous, are in the main for offences which appear not to have been of great seriousness and relate to his drug and alcohol abuse. On two occasions he has been sentenced to terms of imprisonment, namely six months for break, enter and steal, a sentence imposed in early 1998, and a further sentence of three months in respect of a conviction for failure to appear which was served between 28 April 1999 and 27 July 1999.  
     
      
    32    About a year ago Michael Privett entered into a relationship with one Cindy Ray who is the mother of four children from a previous relationship and a son, of whom Michael is the father, born in July this year during the course of the trial. Material placed before me from Ms Cindy Ray and from some of her older children satisfies me that the relationship between her and Michael Privett is a genuine relationship valued by both parties and a relationship which, despite his inevitable lengthy imprisonment, she wishes to continue.  
     
      
    33    Since the jury's verdicts, the prisoner has undergone a clinical psychological assessment carried out by Professor Susan Hayes whose report is before me. Her opinion, based both on her interview with him and on the results of various psychometric tests which she administered, is that he is in the borderline category of intellectual ability, functioning overall at a level lower than ninety-four per cent of the population, and that his intellectual deficits may possibility be due in part to minor brain damage possibly related to drug and alcohol abuse. Certainly she sees substance abuse as his main problem in the past and in the future in terms of his ability to rehabilitate himself into the community following his release from prison. In that regard she is able to point to a number of positives. While in prison he has commenced an agriculture course which he says he is enjoying. He has been prescribed spectacles six months ago and that has made a dramatic change in his ability to read and to write and presumably to learn. She notes that he has undertaken drug and alcohol courses and, in her opinion, he is realistic in his determination to become abstinent from drugs and alcohol in order to maintain his relationship with Cindy Ray and her family. She notes, and I take into account, expressions by him of appropriate remorse about the murder. It is obvious that after release he would need to be supported and monitored by drug and alcohol services on a continuing basis and I accept her opinion that he would be at particular risk if his relationship with Ms Ray and her family deteriorated. Perhaps the most that could be said at this stage is that he is presently well motivated towards his own rehabilitation, he has taken some positive steps in that regard and his prospects of achieving rehabilitation during and after his term of imprisonment are better than his record would suggest.  
     
      
    34    His counsel submitted that there are special circumstances which would justify the setting of an additional term longer than one-third of the minimum, namely the existence of prospects of rehabilitation and the likely need for intensive supervision upon his release to ensure that he does not relapse into drug and alcohol abuse. I accept that such special circumstances exist but the reality is that notwithstanding everything that can be said in favour of Michael Privett's prospect of rehabilitation, the sentence which will be imposed will necessarily be a lengthy one, and application of the statutory formula would produce a lengthy additional term in any event.  
     
      
    35    Michael Privett was arrested on 30 June 1996 and remained in custody to 19 February 1997 when he was admitted bail. He was again taken into custody on 22 April 1999 and has been in custody to the present. However, of this latest period three months represented, as noted earlier, service of a fixed term sentence imposed in respect of a conviction of fail to appear. Making that adjustment, the situation is that he has served almost eleven months in jail in respect of the present matter. Appropriate allowance will be made if I reduce by eight months the total of the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed and commence the sentence from 27 July 1999 which is the time when he completed service of the fixed term of three months to which reference has been made. Material adduced in the sentencing proceedings satisfies me that, because he made statements incriminating Dean Privett and also gave evidence adverse to Dean, Michael Privett has been tagged by fellow prisoners as an informer. For that reason he is at risk of harm from other prisoners, and indeed, although he disclaims any present intention to do so, he may at some time be compelled to seek admission to a protection unit within the prison. Whether he does or not, it is clear that for him imprisonment will be, to a degree, more onerous than would otherwise have been the case. That is a circumstance that I take into account in mitigation of his sentence.  
     
      
    36    Dean Anthony Privett, you have been convicted by the jury of the murder of Peter Browne Rowland. In respect of that crime you are sentenced to penal servitude for a term of seventeen years and nine months, which sentence is deemed to have commenced on 22 October 1998 and will expire on 21 July 2016. That sentence is constructed as follows. There will be a minimum term of fourteen years and six months which, having commenced on 22 October 1998, will end on 21 April 2013. There will be an additional term thereafter of three years and three months during which you may be admitted to parole. The earliest date upon which you will be eligible parole is 21 April 2013.  
     
      
    37    Michael Privett, you have been convicted by the jury of the murder of Peter Browne Rowland. In respect of that crime you are sentenced to penal servitude for fourteen years and eight months. That sentence is deemed to have commenced on 27 July 1999 and will expire on 26 March 2014. That sentence is constructed as follows. There will be a minimum term of eleven years which, having commenced on 27 July 1999, will end on 26 July 2010, and an additional term thereafter of three years eight months during which you may be admitted to parole. The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for parole is 26 July 2010.  
     
      
    38    I have referred earlier to the importance to the rehabilitation prospects of Michael Privett of his continuing relationship with Ms Cindy Ray and her family. I recommend to the Corrective Service authorities that, as early as possible in his sentence, consideration be given to locating him at a prison as close as reasonably possible to the area where Ms Ray and her family reside.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL60651/97DUNFORD JHIDDEN JSMART AJ 
     
     Friday 22 October 1999 
     
     
     R v Colin Alfred GUST 
      
     JUDGMENT 
       
    1    DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by Colin Alfred Gust against his conviction in the District Court at East Maitland, following his trial before his Honour Acting Judge Nader QC and a jury on a charge of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I Crimes Act 1900. The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against the sentence of a minimum term of 3 years penal servitude with an additional term of 3 years imposed on him following his conviction. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years penal servitude. 
    2    The facts of the matter are sufficiently set out in the judgment of Hidden J, which I have had the advantage of reading in draft form. For the reasons given by his Honour, I am not satisfied that this is a case where the jury acting reasonably ought to have had a reasonable doubt and accordingly the ground of appeal that the conviction is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence has not been made out.  
    3    However, I am not satisfied that there should be a new trial because of the direction given by the trial judge on recklessness in relation to consent.  
     
      
     Directions on Recklessness 
      
    4    Some time was spent by counsel on the hearing of the appeal discussing whether there was or was not any basis for the jury to conclude that the appellant was reckless as to whether the appellant was consenting. Not having seen the witnesses nor heard the addresses, but having only read the evidence and with no idea of what was said in the addresses, I would not be prepared to say that there was no basis on which recklessness may have become an issue. For all we know one or other counsel may have referred to the issue in their addresses (neither counsel on the appeal appeared at the trial).  
    5    Section 61R(1) sets out the effect of recklessness in relation to knowledge of lack of consent, and in my experience a direction as to recklessness is generally given whenever consent or knowledge of consent is an issue, unless both counsel agree that it is inappropriate: R v Hemsley (1988) 36 A Crim R 334 at 338 (although that was a case where recklessness could have loomed large in the jury's deliberations). Considering that a trial may miscarry for failure to give directions about issues which are open on the evidence, whether raised by either party or not: Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107 at 117-8, I would be reluctant to hold that an appellant was entitled to a new trial merely because the judge gave a direction (concurred in by both sides) which in the calmer, more remote and detached atmosphere of this Court, was considered unnecessary; and I know of no authority which compels me to hold otherwise. 
    6    Counsel for the appellant referred us to R v Kitchener (1993) 29 NSWLR 696 at 697, 703, and R v Tolmie (1996) 84 A Crim R 293 at 298, 309, but although the view was there expressed that the direction on recklessness were unnecessary, it was not held (nor even argued) that giving the direction itself constituted an error of law entitling the appellant to a new trial. 
    7    In any event, no objection was taken by trial counsel either to the giving of the direction nor to its form when originally given nor when repeated in answer to the jury's question, and indeed both counsel expressly concurred in it (SU 45). Accordingly Rule 4 applies, the point is without merit and I would refuse leave to argue it. 
     
      
     Complaint 
      
    8    It was also submitted that the trial judge erred in his directions relating to complaint in that, although he told the jury that prompt complaint may enhance a complainant's credibility, and went on to direct them (in accordance with s 405B(2)) that delay did not necessarily indicate that the complainant's allegation was false and there might be good reasons why she might hesitate before complaining, he failed to balance the statutory direction by a direction that the delay could adversely reflect upon her credibility and R v Lemura (CCA - 18 December 1998) was referred to. 
    9    Once again no objection was taken or re-direction sought at the trial and consequently Rule 4 applies, unless it can be shown that the misdirection has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Moreover, the delay in this case was only three to four hours, during which the complainant said that she was shocked, locked the doors, had a beer and a number of showers; and as Hidden J has observed at [41] such delay can be considered ""entirely understandable"", whereas the delay in Lemura was (on the evidence) some four months, and in many other cases it has been considerably longer. In these circumstances it may be that delay in complaint did not loom large in defence counsel's address to the jury; for a woman who has just been raped by her cousin on Christmas Day, to lock herself in her house, feel shocked, have a beer and a number of showers before telephoning her sister may have been felt by defence counsel as more likely to provoke sympathy for the complainant rather than doubts about her credibility. Judges do not sum up in a vacuum but in the light of the evidence and the addresses, and once again it is unfortunate that a transcript of the addresses is not available to this Court.  
    10    Finally, it is important to have regard to the substance of what his Honour did actually say. He said (at SU 28): 
     
      
       
       ""Now, members of the jury, with this and other evidence of complaint of the assault to other people you may use this, not as evidence of the fact of the assault but to show consistency between her present claim to have been assaulted in this way and the behaviour. It is consistent, as the Crown said to you, that if a woman attacked in this way complains about it shortly afterwards the complaint is consistent with the fact that the assault occurred. 
       
      
      
       
       And it may not be said in a court case, I have to tell you, but it may be thought by a person that if a person suffers a serious assault and does not mention it to an intimate friend or mother or aunty or something when the opportunity arises shortly after, that may in fact raise a question mark in your mind. This has the opposite effect. It can go to her credibility as a witness. I do not know whether that is clear."" 
       
      
      
     and at SU 29: 
      
       
       ""There was a three or four hour delay before any complaint was made. Now, my direction to you is this in accordance with the Section 405B of the Crimes Act. If there is evidence of a delay in making a complaint the judge shall warn the jury, and that is what I am doing now, to the effect that delay in complaining does not necessarily indicate that the allegation is false. And I should inform you, according to the Act, and I do so, that there may be good reasons why a victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in making a complaint about the assault."" 
       
      
      
    11    The direction in my view made it plain: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Evidence of complaint could be used to show consistency with the fact that she had been assaulted; 
        
        
        (b) If a person suffers a serious assault and does not complain when the opportunity arises shortly after, that may raise a doubt as to her credibility as a witness; 
        
        
        (c) In this case the delay before complaint was three to four hours; 
         
         
        (d) Delay in complaint does not necessarily indicate that the allegation is false; and 
         
         
        (e) There may be good reasons why the victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in making a complaint. 
        
       
      
      
    12    The jury could have been in no doubt that, whereas a prompt complaint tended to support the complainant's credibility, delay could diminish such credibility. The ground is without merit and I would refuse leave under Rule 4. 
    13    Actually, in relation to complaint, the appellant received directions more favourable than he was entitled to because his Honour directed the jury that they could only use the evidence of complaint to show consistency on her part and thus supporting her credibility but not as evidence of the fact of the sexual assault, whereas it has now been established in Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37 that evidence of a complaint, at least if made promptly (and I would regard this complaint as made promptly) can be taken into account by the jury as evidence of the facts complained of.  
     
      
     Warning about Complainant's Evidence 
      
    14    I agree with Hidden J that in the light of the medical evidence this is a case where there was supportive evidence for the complainant and a direction in terms of, or similar to, R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19 was not essential. Once again the actual terms of the summing up bear close examination. At SU 18-19 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       ""Second element, am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did so without her consent? Now I am going to assume that that is the active or live issue in this case. That is where you are going to have to consider the evidence very seriously and in conjunction with one another. Am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did so without her consent? Ordinary English words, without her consent. Of course she testified that it was without her consent. He testified that it was with her consent, but your task is to decide whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was without her consent. It is not, if I may say so, a question of choosing between the most likely of two alternatives, it is a question only of saying, am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of the element?"" 
       
      
      
     and at SU 38: 
      
       
       ""Members of the Jury, the two cases are manifestly obvious in the sense that what each side contends is very clear to you. Both sides agree that there was intercourse. One side has it clearly as non-consensual intercourse. The other side has the opposite. The burden of proof is on the prosecution. It is not a question again of just saying which is the most likely version. In truth you have to be satisfied  
       beyond reasonable doubt 
        in relation to consent and the lack of consent and the knowledge of lack of consent of  
       the version of the prosecution 
       "" (my italics). 
       
      
    15    In the light of these directions, the jury could have been in no doubt that it was essential that they be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what the complainant was saying was true. Once again no re-direction was sought, Rule 4 applies and I would refuse leave. 
     
      
     Failure to Call Character Evidence 
      
    16    Ground 4 of the Amended Grounds of Appeal was: 
     
      
       
       The trial miscarried by reason of the failure of trial counsel to adduce appropriate evidence of the appellant's good character. 
       
      
      
    17    In support of this ground, three affidavits were read, namely those of trial counsel, Wayne Glenn Warwick, the proposed character witness, Wayne Allen Dunstan and a formal affidavit of David Phillip Barrow, a solicitor employed by the Legal Aid Commission. 
    18    Mr Dunstan said in his affidavit that he had known the appellant since 1968, they had been working and taking holidays together, that he became aware of the allegations in this case, and early on in the proceedings provided the appellant with a written character reference. He said that, by arrangement with the appellant, he attended East Maitland Court on 15 September 1997 and was introduced to the appellant's counsel, Mr Warwick, but that they did not discuss the evidence he could give. When the case was adjourned he waited in Sydney until Thursday 18 September, by which time no date for the trial had been allocated and he returned to Cairns to attend to his business. He told the appellant that if the case was to be heard in the following week or two he would not be able to come down because of the expense. He received no further request to attend the proceedings, but would have been able to come down if the trial had been adjourned for a reasonable time. He also said that he would have given evidence that in his opinion the appellant is a man of good character, an honest person, not prone to lying and unlikely to have behaved in the manner described by the complainant in the proceedings. Mr Dunstan has no previous convictions and has been a Justice of the Peace since 1984. 
    19    In his affidavit, Mr Warwick said that in February 1997 in conference with the appellant, he had informed him of the significance of character evidence and suggested he should get character witnesses who knew him well and were able to be called at his trial. But the appellant then told him that he did not want people in his home town to know of the charges. At other times leading up to the trial he again raised with him the question of calling character witnesses. He agreed that the matter was listed for hearing on 15 September 1999 but on that day was adjourned (presumably not reached). He did not recall meeting Mr Dunstan at the court house on 15 September 1997, he told the appellant that his character witnesses should be at court on the adjourned date, but when the trial commenced on 22 September the appellant had no character witnesses present or available to his knowledge. He raised this with the appellant and was informed to proceed without them. He said to the appellant that if he raised character the Crown were going to raise the appellant's Victorian criminal history and he understood that his instructions were not to raise character.  
    20    It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that, not only was Mr Dunstan not called nor an adjournment sought so that he could be present, but no questions were asked of the detective in charge of the case, Detective Hogbin, to the effect that the appellant had no relevant prior convictions, his only prior convictions being in Victoria in 1972 for wilful damage and maliciously kill dog; and that as a result he was deprived of having the jury take into account his good character, not only on the question of guilt or innocence, but also on the question of his credibility when he denied the offences on oath. 
    21    This is not a case of new or fresh evidence: Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 or Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259, as the evidence was known and (subject to Mr Dunstan returning from Cairns) available at the time of the trial, but rather the argument is put on the basis of the incompetency of counsel in failing to raise a relevant issue or to advise his client to seek an adjournment so that Mr Dunstan could appear. Expressed more fully (and accurately), the appellant complains that his counsel's failure to call that evidence or seek an adjournment led to a miscarriage of justice. Unless the error made by counsel (by act or omission) was of such a nature to lead to a miscarriage, this Court will not interfere with the exercise by counsel of their discretion as to the manner in which criminal proceedings are conducted: R v D (1996) 86 A Crim R 41 at 42 and cases there cited. It is not enough to show that there was some evidence known to exist which was in fact not called: ibid at 45. 
    22    In my view, evidence of prior good character is of limited assistance in cases of sexual assault, because such offences are usually committed in private and one's friends and business associates are not aware of the conduct. This is a very different case to R v D where there was no corroboration of the complainant, the Crown case was much weaker than the present, the character evidence was far stronger and its effect in bolstering the accused's credibility would have been significant. Moreover, in this case the uncontradicted evidence of Mr Warwick is that his instructions were to proceed without character witnesses and not to raise the issue of character. I am not satisfied that the failure to raise character in this case led to any miscarriage of justice or that the position was not sufficiently explained to the appellant before he gave his instructions. The ground has not been made out. 
     
      
     Sentence 
      
    23    Although the appellant was a middle aged man of relevantly prior good character, this was a serious sexual assault on a woman in her own home in circumstances where she had befriended him as a relative for social contact on Christmas Day. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years penal servitude. His Honour imposed a total sentence of 6 years, and in doing so took into account all relevant factors which could be put in favour of the appellant. He also found ""special circumstances"", and reduced the minimum term accordingly. In my opinion this sentence was well within the range of a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion.  
     
      
     Conclusion 
      
    24    For these reasons, on the appeal against conviction I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the conviction and on the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal and confirm the sentence. 25    HIDDEN J: The appellant, Colin Alfred Gust, was found guilty of a charge of sexual intercourse without consent after a trial at the District Court at East Maitland. He was sentenced to penal servitude for six years, comprising a minimum term of three years and an additional term of three years. He has appealed against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. 
     
      
     The Crown case  
      
    26    At the relevant time, the complainant was a woman in her early thirties and the appellant was in his mid-forties. Although they were cousins, they had known each other for only a matter of months previously, having met on two occasions at the home of the appellant’s mother.  
    27    In the afternoon of Christmas Day, 1995 the appellant visited the complainant at her home at Paxton in the Hunter region. They spent some time together, conversing and drinking beer. According to the complainant, later in the afternoon he said something about her and her two sisters, the effect of which was that he found them attractive. He decided to leave in the early evening. At the front gate of the property he made a crude remark of a sexual nature about the complainant’s sister, Karen. She punched him, causing his nose to bleed. She returned inside the house and he followed her. He asked her for something to wipe his nose with and she gave him a towel.  
    28    She walked to her lounge room door, waiting for him to leave. He came towards her and pushed her into her bedroom, which adjoined the lounge room. He said, “It’s not you I want but you’ll do for now.” She remonstrated with him, calling him “a fucking jerk”. He pushed her onto the bed, and held her down with one hand while he undid his jeans with the other. He pushed her dress up to her stomach and removed her underwear. She said to him, “Stop it, get off”, in an hysterical tone. He slapped her to the left side of her head with an open hand. He penetrated her vaginally, causing her pain. She tried to remove him by pushing on his chest. He withdrew at the last minute and ejaculated on her stomach. 
    29    He left the house, and she remained on the bed for some time. She got up, locked the doors, wandered about the house and showered several times. She drank some more beer. She was aware that her immediate neighbours were out, visiting relatives. Eventually, some three to four hours after the appellant had left, she rang her other sister, Mrs Lindy Zarb, who lived at South Grafton. She was obviously upset and complained that the appellant had raped her. Her sister advised her to phone their aunt, Mrs Hilda Craft, who lived not far from the complainant’s home. She did so, again complaining that she had been raped by the appellant. Mrs Craft also could hear that she was distressed. In company with her grandson, she drove immediately to the complainant’s home. 
    30    Later that night, the complainant was interviewed by police and in the small hours of the following morning she was examined by a doctor. The doctor observed some red swelling, which she believed to be recent, at the side of her left eyebrow. She considered this injury to be consistent with the open handed slap by the appellant which the complainant had described. She also found the complainant’s stomach to be tender and observed a graze on the inner opening of her vagina. That also she considered to be a recent injury, suggesting forceful penetration when the genital area was not adequately lubricated. She agreed that it was not necessarily inconsistent with vigorous consensual intercourse with a woman who was not fully aroused. 
    31    The doctor also observed bruising on the back of the complainant’s legs and on her lower back which, from its appearance, may not have been recent. I shall turn shortly to the significance of that observation. 
     
      
     Defence case 
      
    32    The appellant gave evidence, adhering to the account which he had given to police when he was interviewed on the day after the alleged offence. He said that during the afternoon at the complainant’s home the conversation turned to their fathers, both of whom are deceased, and they held hands. She kissed and hugged him, and they both became aroused. They went to the bedroom and engaged in foreplay. She asked him to use a condom but he expressed reluctance to do so. In evidence, he said that he asked her if she had a condom as he did not, and she became angry. To the police he said that the cause of her anger was the fact that he mistakenly addressed her by the name of one of her sisters. Whatever the reason, she struck him and it was on this occasion that she caused his nose to bleed. He left, but as he walked out the front gate she apologised and invited him back inside. 
    33    After he returned to the house the conversation turned to the complainant’s boyfriend, from whom she was estranged at the time. She complained that he was violent to her, and lifted her dress to show the appellant bruising which he had caused. His description of where those bruises were was imprecise, but it was not inconsistent with the older looking bruising which the doctor described. In her evidence, the complainant agreed that she had talked about her boyfriend’s violence but denied that she had lifted her dress to show the appellant the bruises. 
    34    Eventually, the complainant led the appellant back to her bedroom, where they engaged in foreplay and consensual intercourse. She allowed him to penetrate her without a condom after he assured her that he was “clean” and that he would ejaculate outside her. This he did. 
     
      
     Unreasonable verdict? 
      
    35    In this Court the appellant was represented by Mr Bruce of counsel, who did not appear at the trial. It is appropriate to deal first with a ground of appeal that the verdict is unreasonable in the sense that, on the whole of the evidence, the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt. The familiar principles governing the Court’s approach to such a ground of appeal were explained by the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. 
    36    Mr Bruce relied on a number of matters in support of this ground. Firstly, the history provided by the complainant to the doctor was inconsistent with her evidence in several respects. She told the doctor that the appellant had “forced the doors back” before pushing her into the bedroom, that he had “ripped her clothes off”, and that he had forced his knees into her body while she was on the bed. She had said none of these things in evidence, although it may be that her reference to his having ripped her clothes off was simply a dramatic way of describing his pushing up her dress and removing her underwear. 
    37    I do not consider that these inconsistencies are of any importance. What is more significant is that she told the doctor that the appellant had tried to put his penis into her mouth. She made no such allegation in evidence nor, apparently, in her statement to the police. 
    38    Secondly, Mr Bruce relied upon the appellant’s evidence, which the complainant denied, that she had lifted her dress to show him bruising caused by her boyfriend. Clearly, there was such bruising. The argument was that the appellant could not have seen it otherwise than in the circumstances as he described them, because it was most unlikely that he would have seen it in the course of the alleged sexual assault. 
    39    Thirdly, Mr Bruce referred to the fact that the appellant gave a thorough, exculpatory account to police when first spoken to, before any detail of the complainant’s allegations had been put to him. His description of a number of the surrounding circumstances was consistent with the complainant’s own account. 
    40    Finally, Mr Bruce argued that the evidence of complaint did not advance the Crown case, given the lapse of some hours before any complaint was made. He referred to her age and the fact that, on any view of the evidence, she did not shrink from striking the appellant when he offended her, demonstrating that she had no difficulty in asserting herself. In the circumstances, it was argued, one would have expected her to complain more promptly. 
    41    These are significant matters favouring the defence case, but they do not persuade me that the verdict is unreasonable. In evidence, the complainant did not recall what she had told the doctor. She added that she had been drinking before she saw her, although she was not drunk. She could not explain the delay in complaining after the appellant had left other than to say that she was shocked. Nevertheless, as a matter of ordinary human experience, I consider that delay to be entirely understandable. More importantly, there was significant confirmation of her account in the doctor’s observation of injuries to her face and her genital area. 
    42    Whilst it is the duty of this Court to make its own assessment of the evidence, due respect must be afforded to the jury’s function as the tribunal of fact and the undoubted advantage the jurors had of hearing and observing the witnesses. Credibility, particularly of the complainant and the appellant, loomed large. In all the circumstances, it cannot be said that the jury, acting reasonably, ought to have had a reasonable doubt. Let me turn, then, to the other grounds of appeal. 
     
      
     Directions on recklessness 
      
    43    The trial judge directed the jury about the elements of the crime of sexual intercourse without consent, including knowledge on the part of the appellant that the complainant was not consenting. His Honour went on to give a direction about recklessness as to consent in accordance with s61R(1) of the Crimes Act. In the course of explaining that concept, his Honour said: “… it puts you at your peril if you are going to have sexual intercourse with someone to take the trouble to know whether they are consenting or not…” His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
       So when I speak about the third element and when I say that you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew you must give it that extended meaning, either knew, actually knew, or was reckless about it whether she was consenting or not. 
       
      
    44    After they had retired to consider their verdict, the jury sought his Honour’s further explanation of the notion of “reckless consent”. His Honour gave a further direction, which included the following: 
     
      
       
       Now you can either find affirmatively that the accused knew that the victim was not consenting, that of course is the end of the matter. Or you may find that you cannot answer that question, but that you can be satisfied that the accused was reckless as to whether the person was consenting or not, just did not care whether the person was consenting or not. 
       
      
    45    Counsel for the appellant at the trial did not complain about the fact that a direction on recklessness was given or about the terms of it. Nevertheless, Mr Bruce submitted that his Honour fell into error in two respects. Firstly, no direction about recklessness should have been given as the issue did not arise on the evidence. Secondly, even if the issue did arise, his Honour failed to explain to the jury how it did, so as to relate his directions of law to the evidence. 
    46    In sexual assault cases a direction about recklessness should not be given as a matter of course, and should be confined to cases where the evidence raises that issue. So much was recognised by this Court in R v Kitchener (1993) 29 NSWLR 696, per Kirby P at 697 and Carruthers J at 703, and Tolmie (1996) 84 A Crim R 293, per Kirby P at 298 and Newman J at 309. In both those cases the court considered that no miscarriage of justice had occurred because the direction was given when it was not called for, but it appears that in neither was that proposition argued. In each case the submission was that the direction was erroneous, not that it should not have been given at all. 
    47    In the present case it is difficult to see how a question of recklessness arose. On the complainant’s evidence, she clearly did not consent to sexual intercourse. On the appellant’s account, she clearly did. Significantly, at the end of his summing-up his Honour encapsulated the issue in this way: 
     
      
       
       Members of the Jury, the two cases were manifestly obvious in the sense that what each side contends is very clear to you. Both sides agree that there was intercourse. One side has it clearly as non-consensual intercourse. The other side has the opposite. 
       
      
    48    His Honour sentenced the appellant on the basis that he had been reckless about the complainant’s consent. He appears to have been influenced in that approach by the jury’s question to which I have referred, adding that it was possibly a “case of recklessness”, although he thought it “quite unlikely”. With respect, it is difficult to see how his Honour could properly have approached the question of sentence on that basis. Prior to passing sentence he placed on record the facts of the offence as he found them. They were consistent with the complainant’s evidence and, on her account, no question of recklessness could have arisen. 
    49    In this Court, the Crown prosecutor submitted that the issue was raised by the appellant’s own version of events. According to him, the first episode of intimacy in the bedroom ended with the complainant becoming angry, either because he had used the name of one of her sisters or because of their exchange about a condom. When intercourse did occur later, it was without a condom. Is it likely, asked the Crown prosecutor, that the complainant would have consented to unprotected intercourse at that stage when she was not prepared to engage in it earlier? It was open to the jury, he argued, to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt about much of his account and yet to be satisfied that, in all the circumstances, he penetrated the complainant indifferent to her consent. 
    50    I consider this to be a very strained view of the evidence, and one which would not reasonably have been available to the jury. On the appellant’s version, it was the complainant who initiated the second intimate episode during which intercourse took place. Even if the view propounded by the Crown prosecutor were open, his Honour did not refer to it at any stage of the summing-up. Indeed, it does not appear to have been any part of the Crown case at the trial. I think there is force in Mr Bruce’s submission that the passages in the summing-up which I have extracted in par19 of these reasons could have led the jury to the erroneous view that there was some positive duty on the part of the appellant to enquire of the complainant whether she consented to intercourse. 
    51    The jury were left with a direction in law about recklessness, but were given no guidance about its possible bearing on the evidence in the case. Their question, I suspect, was the result of understandable bewilderment about a matter which they were not prepared to dismiss as insignificant. In my view, leave should be granted to argue this ground and it has been made out. These directions could well have given rise to a miscarriage of justice, and there must be a new trial. 
    52    Mr Bruce submitted that the Court should enter verdict and judgment of acquittal, because the event giving rise to the charge is now almost four years old and the appellant has served more than half of the minimum term imposed upon him. However, given the seriousness of the charge, I am satisfied that a new trial should be ordered. Should the appellant be found guilty upon the re-trial, the period he has spent in custody would be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence. 
    53    Strictly speaking, that is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. However, it is necessary to comment on two other grounds of appeal, as the issues raised by them will need to be considered in the re-trial. 
     
      
     Complaint 
      
    54    One of the grounds of appeal is that the trial judge erred in his directions to the jury about the evidence of complaint. Although I find it unnecessary to decide this ground, what I am about to say fortifies me in my view that the interests of justice would be served by a new trial.  
    55    His Honour gave the jury the conventional common law direction about complaint, that is, that it was evidence bearing upon the complainant’s credibility. In the light of the delay of some hours before complaint was made, his Honour went on to direct the jury, in accordance with s405B(2) of the Crimes Act, that that delay did not necessarily indicate that the complainant’s allegation was false and that there might be good reasons why she might hesitate before complaining. Mr Bruce argued that his Honour failed to balance that statutory direction by a direction that the delay could reflect adversely upon her credibility: cf Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427, Reg v Lemura (CCA, unreported 18 December 1998). 
    56    Since this appeal was argued the High Court has handed down its decision in Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA37. In the light of that decision, it is now clear that in the present case the evidence of complaint, being made at a time when the event must have been fresh in the complainant’s memory, is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule under s66(2) of the Evidence Act. Accordingly, it is admissible as evidence of the fact complained of, not merely as material bearing upon the complainant’s credibility. That being so, however, it would be the subject of an appropriate warning to the jury: s165(1)(a) of the Evidence Act. 
    57    This does not alter the fact that the delay in complaint requires a direction under s405B of the Crimes Act. That section was inserted into the Act at a time when evidence of complaint was still governed by the common law and, no doubt, was drafted upon the assumption that complaint evidence went to credibility only. Nevertheless, evidence of complaint sufficiently recent to be admissible under s66 of the Evidence Act may still have a bearing on credit: cf Reg v Davis [1999] NSWCCA 15, per Wood CJ at CL at par 35. No doubt, at a re-trial the appellant would submit to the jury that the delay in complaint reflects adversely upon the complainant’s credibility. Fairness would require that a direction under s405B should be balanced by the observation that the delay may do just that. 
     
      
     Warning about complainant’s evidence 
      
    58    Mr Bruce also submitted that, as the Crown case depended almost entirely upon the complainant’s evidence, the jury should have been directed to scrutinise that evidence with great care. He relied upon the familiar passage from the judgement of Lee J (as his Honour then was) in R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19:  
     
      
       
       In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in… 
       
      
    59    Lee J’s observation was directed to trials in which the Crown case was dependent upon the evidence of one witness, unsupported by any other evidence in the case. It has been held that such a direction was not called for in cases where there was such supportive evidence (even though it might not have amounted to corroboration in the strict sense): R v Zafiris (CCA, unreported 14 September 1998) per Powell JA at pp31-5; R v Davis (supra) per Wood CJ at CL at paras 19-21. In the light of the medical evidence, this is such a case and it is not immediately apparent that a Murray direction was called for. 
    60    This is not to deny that there may be cases in which such a direction should be given even though there is evidence providing some support for the account of the principal witness. Such a case was R v Vawdrey (CCA, unreported 16 April 1998): see the judgment of Smart J at pp8-9, 17-18. The matter should not be approached with rigid preconceptions about when a direction might be required. The evidence in each case must be assessed with an eye to ensuring a fair trial. Whether a direction is called for at the appellant’s re-trial would need to be determined in the light of the evidence as it unfolded. 
     
      
     Orders 
      
    61    I would propose that the appeal be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered. 
    62    SMART AJ: The facts and contentions are sufficiently set out in the reasons of my colleagues. For the reasons given by Hidden J, I too am not persuaded that this is a case where the jury acting reasonably ought to have had a reasonable doubt. The ground of appeal that the conviction is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence has not been established.  
    63    I agree with the reasons of Dunford J on the other grounds of appeal but I wish to add a few comments.  
    64    On reading the transcript, my initial reaction was that this was a case where recklessness about consent was either not a real issue or one on the periphery of the case. The facts seemed to raise an issue of whether the complainant did not consent and the appellant knew that she was not consenting. However, it was a case where events unfolded over a period of time. She received him into her home but they were related.  
    65    In the absence of the addresses, this Court does not know what, if anything, was said about recklessness by counsel. Perhaps it was touched upon in passing and mentioned for the sake of completeness. More could have been said. Nor does this Court know what impressions the witnesses made or how they gave their evidence. Despite my considerable reservations, it is hard to rule out recklessness completely because of the limited materials which are available.  
    66    The jury did ask for an explanation of recklessness and in his remarks upon sentence the judge stated that he thought that it was really possible that this was a case of recklessness although he thought it was quite unlikely. In expressing this view the judge took into account the question the jury asked during its deliberations. The judge then said that he thought it was proper to sentence the appellant on the basis that there was no actual knowledge of lack of consent but deemed knowledge within the section that deals with recklessness. He regarded recklessness as very serious but slightly less serious than having actual knowledge of lack of consent. The judge thus sentenced on a basis favourable to the appellant.  
    67    It seems that both parties were content for the judge to leave the issue of recklessness to the jury. The judge furnished counsel with draft directions prior to their addresses (Tr 25 September 1997 at pp 4 and 30). There was no objection. This was followed by discussion between counsel and the judge as to the use to be made of the complainant's evidence. The judge restricted its use and also indicated the direction he was going to give as to the assessment of the witnesses.  
    68    It was submitted that on the recklessness point the judge did not sufficiently relate the law to the facts. At SU15-16, the judge explained what was meant by ""recklessness"". He explained the matter further in answer to the jury's question at SU44-45. The Crown prosecutor and counsel for the appellant expressed themselves as satisfied with the direction given. I think that the directions given were, in the circumstances, sufficient.  
    69    The force of the views expressed by Hidden J is appreciated. However, even if recklessness was incorrectly left to the jury, this did not cause a miscarriage of justice.  
    70    There is no substance in the submissions as to delay. A mature woman was forced to have intercourse with a male relative in her own home. She was on her own and it was in the evening. She felt the need to take a number of showers, to allow for the shock, to gather her forces and to endeavour to gather some composure. No point can be made that her taking three to four hours to telephone her sister and her aunt adversely affected the reliability of her complaint and her credibility.  
    71    The appeal should be dismissed.

     REGINA v Wing Piew CHUNG 
      
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1     SULLY J: I have had the benefit of seeing in draft the judgment of Hidden J. I agree with his Honour that the appeal should be dismissed. I agree with the reasons given by his Honour in support of the making of that order.  
     
      
       
      
    2     I wish, however, to add some brief observations of my own concerning the appropriateness, in a case of the present kind, of the imposition of the statutory maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. 
     
      
       
      
    3     Hidden J draws attention to the obviously daunting implications of a sentence of life imprisonment. His Honour refers to portion of the judgment of Hunt J (as he then was) in Petroff (unreported, 12 November 1991). I do not disagree with anything said by Hidden J in these portions of his Honour’s judgment. I would wish, however, to supplement what his Honour has said by drawing attention to the following extract from the judgment of Allen J in Baker (unreported, CCA (NSW), 20 September 1995): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “Section 19A of the  
         Crimes Act 1900 
          empowers this court to sentence a person convicted of murder to penal servitude for life. That is what such a sentence, if imposed, means. It means for life. It means that never can there be any hope of release. It means never, no matter how many decades go by, will the prison door be opened and the prisoner be allowed out again. It matters not whether he is sixty, seventy, or survives to eighty. He is there for life. Such a sentence cannot lightly be imposed in any civilised society.  
         
        
        
         
         There are, of course, circumstances in which in a civilised society such a sentence may be called for. Such cases will be quite exceptional. But clearly they exist. The law so provides. It would be foolish in the extreme to attempt to give a list of the types of cases which would warrant the court taking this, the most extreme measure available to the law. Three, however, stand out in respect of murder. The first is the case of the professional killer, the person who cold-bloodedly assassinates others for gain. That is one category. Another is the case where the killer is so fundamentally psychotic that it could never be safe to release him back into the community. I may say that the evidence that that is so would, so far as I am concerned, need to be quite strong. The third is the case of an offender who embarks on such a course of criminality that nothing short of the knowledge that the most extreme punishment the law can give awaits him would deter him from continuing that course.” 
         
        
       
      
    4     It is, of course, the case that Allen J was dealing with a life sentence imposed as punishment for the crime of murder rather than with a life sentence imposed for the worst kind of drug-related criminal conduct. I believe, however, that the substance of what his Honour had to say in the former context is equally applicable, mutatis mutandis¸ to the latter context. In my opinion the third of the exceptional categories to which Allen J refers, that is to say the category of “an offender who embarks on such a course of criminality that nothing short of the knowledge that the most extreme punishment the law can give awaits him would deter him from continuing that course”, fits precisely the sort of offender with whom the Court is called upon to deal in the present particular case. In that connection, I wish to reaffirm for my own part the following propositions which I stated in the course of passing sentence in Cheung Wai Man & ors. (unreported, 22 March 1991): 
     
      
       
        
         
         “1. The importation of heroin into this country in any amount and at any time constitutes a deliberate threat to the well-being of the Australian community. The same is to be said of any form of trafficking in heroin within this country. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The importation or the attempted importation of, and the trafficking or attempted trafficking in, a quantity of heroin of the amount here in question is in a very real sense a declaration of war upon this community. It is a distinct challenge both to concepts of human dignity and to moral values otherwise which are fundamental to our way of life. It is no less a challenge to the rule of law which is in the end the ultimate guarantor of the personal freedoms and of the social stability which all of us Australians take for granted. 
         
        
        
         
         3. In the face of such challenges each of the institutional supports of our society has a role to play. That of the Courts is to punish and deter according to law. Obviously, the Courts alone cannot meet adequately, let alone defeat, the challenge of which I have been speaking. What the Courts can do is to punish drug-related crime in a way which signals plainly to drug traffickers, especially foreign drug traffickers, that the Courts are both able and willing to calibrate their sentences until a point is reached at which, to a significant extent even if never perfectly, fear of punishment risked will neutralise the greed which is the only possible motive of those who, ………………….. engage in drug-related crime when they are themselves not drug-dependent.”

    5     IRELAND J: I agree with the order proposed by Hidden J for the reasons given by his Honour. 
     
      
       
      
    6     I am also in agreement with the additional comments made by Sully J.IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL

     Regina v Wing Piew Chung  
      
      
      
     
     
      
       
      
    Reasons for judgment7     HIDDEN J: This is an application for leave to appeal against what the Court understands to be the first sentence of imprisonment for life to have been passed under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The applicant, Wing Piew Chung, was found guilty of a charge of supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of heroin after a trial before Kirkham DCJ and a jury. By s33(3)(a) of the Act, imprisonment for life is the maximum sentence prescribed for that offence. By s33A(1), that sentence is for the term of the prisoner’s natural life.  
     
      
       
      
    8     He was also sentenced to twelve months imprisonment upon a charge of possession of a falsified passport, to which he had pleaded guilty. In addition, his Honour took into account a charge of goods in custody relating to an amount of about $24,000 in cash in his possession at the time of his arrest. These matters are of no present consequence. 
     
      
       
        
       The facts 
        
       
      
    9     The charge of supplying heroin spanned the period June to November 1993. It was founded upon evidence of the applicant’s having actually supplied, or having had in his possession for supply, heroin totalling about 73kg. Allowing a margin for error in that assessment, his Honour sentenced him on the basis that the quantity was 63kg. The large commercial quantity is 1kg.  
     
      
       
      
    10     The principal evidence against the applicant was that of an accomplice, Chin Chew Huang, whose role was very much subordinate to his. After a Crown appeal, Huang had been sentenced by this Court to imprisonment for nine years, comprising a minimum term of six years and an additional term of three years: Huang (1994) 78 ACrim R 111. In his case, regard was had not only to his role but also to extensive assistance which he had afforded and would continue to afford to the authorities which, among other things, led to the prosecution of the applicant. It was not suggested before us that the sentence passed upon Huang should have had any bearing on the appropriate sentence for the applicant.  
     
      
       
      
    11     For the purpose of sentence Kirkham DCJ accepted Huang as a witness of truth, noting that the jury must also have done so. His Honour summarised the salient features of Huang’s evidence at some length in his comprehensive remarks on sentence. It is unnecessary to repeat that material. It is sufficient to sketch in broad outline the applicant’s involvement in the distribution of heroin in Sydney. 
     
      
       
      
    12     His Honour concluded that the applicant’s place “in the hierarchy of drug distribution” was “very much at the upper end of the scale”. He occupied a position of seniority in a network which was engaged in the sale of heroin at what might be termed the wholesale level. Heroin was received from overseas, sometimes brought here by members of the crew of international aircraft. It was stored at various locations in Sydney and sold at others. The distribution was on a large scale and was well organised. A system of coding was in place for communication with purchasers. On one occasion, when Huang’s driver’s licence had expired the applicant was able to arrange the production of a false licence for him. 
     
      
       
      
    13     The enterprise in Sydney was associated with an international criminal organisation known as Ah Kong, which had its headquarters in Thailand. It appears that the applicant was prepared to further his ends by the use of violence, if necessary. At an early stage of their association in Australia, the applicant ensured Huang’s co-operation by threatening to kill or harm members of his family. On another occasion, he sought to protect his income from the sale of heroin by telling another dealer that he would kill him if he reduced his prices. Later in 1993 the applicant left Australia, but he continued to give Huang directions and advice about the enterprise by telephone from Singapore.  
     
      
       
      
    14     There was evidence before his Honour about the average purity and price of heroin sold on the street in 1993. His Honour concluded that the heroin the subject of the charge, which was of a high grade of purity, had a potential street value of roughly $150 million. From time to time, the applicant or his associates transported very large amounts of money out of Australia in a clandestine manner. 
     
      
       
      
    15     His Honour was conscious of the fact that the single charge of which the applicant was found guilty represented a pattern of criminality of a high order. As he put it: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The allegations against the prisoner were very detailed, broad ranging and extremely serious. They traversed a course of conduct which may be described as crimes against the members of the community of the most reprehensible and rapacious kind. 
         
        
        
       Subjective case 
        
       
      
    16     His Honour observed that little was known of the applicant. He did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. Nor had he in the trial. There was some background material in the history he provided to a psychologist, whose report was in evidence.  
     
      
       
      
    17     The applicant was thirty-nine years old at the time of the offence and is now forty-five. He has no criminal record. He was born in Singapore and appears to have had a disturbed upbringing. His parents divorced while he was still an infant, and his relationship with them and his siblings was severed at that point. He was brought up by an uncle and aunt, whom he came to consider to be his family. His uncle was an alcoholic, given to outbursts of anger, and he and his aunt were the victims of physical and mental abuse. 
     
      
       
      
    18     He did not complete high school, leaving at the age of fourteen. Thereafter, he was employed in a variety of occupations. He undertook an apprenticeship as a carpenter but was unable to complete it because, as he claimed, he was unfairly imprisoned for an act which he did not commit. He told the psychologist that he spent seven years in prison, but he did not explain what it was he was alleged to have done. 
     
      
       
      
    19     It appears from the report that he has a partner and children living overseas. The report says nothing about them, apart from recording his expressed concern for them. Significantly, it is not suggested that he himself has ever used heroin or, indeed, any other drug.  
     
      
       
      
    20     A prison report describes him as a “quiet, efficient and reliable worker”.  
     
      
       
        
        
        
       The sentence 
        
       
      
    21     His Honour considered that, viewed objectively, the offence fell “into the worst case category”. He expressed himself “constrained to impose the maximum penalty,” and it is apparent that nothing in the applicant’s subjective case dissuaded him from that course. Before passing sentence, his Honour had this to say: 
     
      
       
        
         
         The consequences of heroin addiction in the community are well known. The human death toll with addicted persons, many of them young, dying from the effects of overdose or contamination of heroin is too often seen in the community. Few families can say with any confidence that they, their friends or relatives have not, at one stage or another, been touched by the tragic consequences of heroin use. 
         
        
        
         
         Daily in these courts persons being sentenced for offences of dishonesty such as breaking, entering and stealing from the homes of the members of the community, armed robbery, bag snatching and other such serious offences claim as their motivation their need to obtain money to satisfy their heroin habit. For many, this habit requires many hundreds of dollars per day and in some cases much more to purchase heroin in the maintenance of their habits. In this way the scourge of heroin addiction converts previously law abiding citizens, the majority of whom seem to be under the age of 30, into people vulnerable to the spread of aids and other communicable diseases and who are prepared, themselves, to rob, steal and cheat to obtain funds to buy heroin. 
         
        
        
         
         It is from the fruits of these crimes that money used to buy heroin finds its way into the pockets of large scale heroin dealers, like the prisoner. It seems to be the case that whilst ever large profits are available to be made, people like the prisoner will be prepared to take the risks of detection, prosecution and imprisonment. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    22     Before us, no exception was taken to any of those remarks. Nor could it have been. 
     
      
       
        
       The application 
        
       
      
    23     The substantial argument before us was that the sentence of life imprisonment is manifestly excessive. Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that the offence fell into the most serious category of its kind, but argued that this did not necessarily mean that a life sentence was called for. It was his submission that a very long determinate sentence was the appropriate course. 
     
      
       
      
    24     The sentence of life imprisonment under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act has the same effect as penal servitude for life under s19A of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum sentence for the crime of murder. That sentence has been considered by this Court on a number of occasions, including the recent decision of R v Rose [1999] NSWCCA 327, when I was a member of the Court. I made some observations about it then, and I consider it appropriate to repeat and expand upon those observations now.  
     
      
       
      
    25     No-one would deny the gravity of the life sentence in New South Wales. The prisoner is condemned to die in gaol, without any prospect of release on parole: s25A(6) of the Sentencing Act, 1989. The possibility of the exercise of the Royal prerogative of mercy is so remote as to be discounted. In R v Garforth (CCA unreported 23 May 1994) at p11, this Court recognised “the terrible significance” of the sentence. Their Honours quoted the passage of the judgment of Hunt J (as he then was) in R v Petroff (unreported 12 November 1991) at pp1-2:  
     
      
       
        
         
         The indeterminate nature of a life sentence has long been the subject of criticism by penologists and others concerned with the prison system and the punishment of offenders generally. Such a sentence deprives a prisoner of any fixed goal to aim for, it robs him of any incentive and it is personally destructive of his morale. The life sentence imposes intolerable burdens upon most prisoners because of their incarceration for an indeterminate period, and the result of that imposition has been an increased difficulty in their management by the prison authorities. 
         
        
        
       It should be borne in mind that his Honour was there speaking of the life sentence before the enactment of s19A, when the prisoner had a reasonable prospect of release on licence. 
        
       
      
    26     It is true that a crime falling within the worst category may attract the maximum sentence prescribed even though it is possible to envisage a worse case: Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1987-88) 164 CLR 465 at 478. However, imprisonment for life in this State is different from other maximum sentences. They still embrace the prospect of release in the future, however distant. The life sentence does not. It should be reserved for crimes of the utmost heinousness, where considerations of retribution, general deterrence or protection of society are such as entirely to displace any claim by the prisoner for compassion and the community’s interest in the rehabilitation of offenders. 
     
      
       
      
    27     The present case is unaffected by s431B of the Crimes Act, as the offence was committed before that section came into force. Of course, the purpose of the section is to require the imposition of the life sentence in certain extreme cases. Nevertheless, I consider that it provides some guide to the limited circumstances in which that sentence might be appropriate in any case. For present purposes, it is sufficient to set out subs(2): 
     
      
       
        
         
         (2) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of an offence under section 25 (2) or (2A) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 to which section 33 (subsection (2) excepted) of that Act applies involving heroin or cocaine if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence and the court is also satisfied that: 
          
          
         (a) the offence involved: 
          
          
          (i) a high degree of planning and organisation, and 
          
          
          (ii) the use of other people acting at the direction of the person convicted of the offence in the commission of the offence, and 
          
          
         (b) the person was solely or principally responsible for planning, organising and financing the offence, and 
          
          
         (c) the heroin or cocaine was of a high degree of purity, and 
          
          
         (d) the person committed the offence solely for financial  
          
         reward. 
         
        
       
      
    28     Clearly, any court would impose a sentence of imprisonment for life only after a most careful examination of all the circumstances of the case. In many very serious cases of drug trafficking the appropriate sentence would be a very long term of years, with a minimum term such as to ensure that a significant proportion of the prisoner’s life was spent in custody. While retaining the prospect of eventual release, such a sentence would be very severe and would normally meet the community’s legitimate demand for retribution and deterrence. 
     
      
       
      
    29     The question remains whether Kirkham DCJ has been shown to have fallen into error in imposing the life sentence in the present case. This Court would scrutinise any life sentence but, at the end of the day, whether the Court should intervene depends upon the application of the familiar principles governing appellate review of a judicial discretion. Applying those principles, I cannot say that it was not open to his Honour to conclude that the applicant’s culpability was such as to call for the imposition of the maximum sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    30     As it happens, the applicant’s criminality would appear to meet all the requirements of s431B(2) of the Crimes Act. He was a ruthless profiteer from the widespread distribution of high grade heroin, occupying a position towards the pinnacle of a well organised criminal network. It is true that he has no recorded convictions and experienced a disturbed upbringing. However, little is known of his adult life apart from what emerged in the evidence of Huang, who had known him for some years before 1993. From his Honour’s summary of it in the remarks on sentence, it is sufficient to say that that evidence does not appear to have been to his credit. Accordingly, this is a case of heinous crime, in which the community interest in retribution and deterrence wholly outweighs any claim which the applicant might have for leniency arising from his background. 
     
      
       
      
    31     I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.

      FRIDAY 22 OCTOBER 1999 
      REGINA v MARIA ASUNCION CHAMORRA CAMPOS  
     
     JUDGMENT 
     1   JAMES J: This is an application brought by Maria Asuncion Chamorra Campos for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on her in the District Court on 12 November 1998 by his Honour Judge Rummery, after a jury had found her guilty of the following charges: 
     
      
    2   (1) that on 14 October 1997 at Sydney she had in her possession without reasonable excuse narcotic goods, being not less than the trafficable quantity of heroin (168.6 grams gross and 139.9 grams of pure heroin) reasonably suspected of having being imported into Australia. This was an offence under s 233B(1)(ca) of the Customs Act (Cth) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years and/or a fine of $100,000. 
     
      
    3   (2) that on the same date in Sydney she was in possession of $6,000 that might reasonably be suspected of being the proceeds of crime. This was an offence under s 82(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act (Cth), for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for two years and/or a fine of $5,000. 
     
      
    4   In sentencing the applicant, his Honour Judge Rummery took into account pursuant to s 16BA of the Crimes Act (Cth) a further offence under s 82(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act of being in possession of moneys reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime. 
     
      
    5   On the first charge the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for six years eight months to date from 26 June 1998, the date on which the applicant was found guilty and was taken into custody, with a non-parole period of four years eight months. On the second charge the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 15 months, also to date from 26 June 1998 and hence to be served concurrently with part of the non-parole period of the sentence on the first charge. 
     
      
    6   The facts of the offences were concisely stated by Judge Rummery in his remarks on sentence, in a way which has not been challenged on the hearing of this application. 
     
      
    7   On 14 October 1997 the applicant was arrested at her place of work in the central business district in Sydney. She had $6,000 in her handbag. The applicant's possession of this sum was the subject of the second charge in the indictment. Later the same day police searched the applicant's bedroom in her home at Matraville and found 168.6 grams of a substance, which on analysis was found to contain 139.9 grams of pure heroin, in a plastic bag in the wardrobe in the bedroom. Police also found a set of scales and a number of small clipseal plastic bags of a kind frequently used by persons dealing in prohibited drugs. 
     
      
    8   The facts of the offence which Judge Rummery took into account in sentencing the applicant were that between 22 May 1997 and 2 October 1997 she had participated in the remittance overseas by 31 separate transactions of a total sum of $347,316.57, the role played by the applicant consisting of taking cash to various banks and arranging for telegraphic transfers of amounts of money overseas.  
     
      
    9   In his remarks on sentence Judge Rummery referred to the principal subjective circumstances of the applicant. She was born in Chile on 1 February 1977, the second of three children. Her parents were divorced when she was four years old. She came to Australia with her family in 1987, spending a holiday with her mother's extended family in Australia. The members of the family in Australia applied for the applicant’s family to be permitted to reside in Australia and permission was granted in 1990. The applicant completed her secondary education in Australia and undertook TAFE studies in office administration, computer studies and bookkeeping. Soon after leaving school she worked for a man named Juan Francisco Uzabeaga on a job placement. She became permanently employed in Uzabeaga's business, a business known as MP Communications, which acquired business premises at Wynyard. The business was carried on by a company in which Uzabeaga and the applicant were the only directors and the only shareholders with Uzabeaga holding the majority of the shares. The principal ostensible business carried on by the company was the sale of mobile telephones. 
     
      
    10   In 1996 the applicant entered into a sexual relationship with Uzabeaga, which continued until her arrest. Uzabeaga was a middle aged, married man, also from Chile. The applicant's mother regarded Uzabeaga as exploitative and manipulative and counselled her daughter, unsuccessfully, against continuing the relationship with him. After the applicant was arrested she was granted bail and she remained on bail until the jury found her guilty at her trial. 
     
      
    11   Much of the sentencing judge's statement of the subjective circumstances of the applicant was taken from a pre-sentence report prepared by a Probation and Parole officer. The sentencing judge also referred to the officer's opinion that ""the offender presents as mortified and traumatised by her experiences of incarceration. She acknowledged that when she realised that she had been trapped she felt quite anxious and isolated and was fearful for her own safety."" 
     
      
    12   In his remarks on sentence Judge Rummery referred to a letter in a sealed envelope relating to assistance provided to the authorities by the applicant. Having read the letter, his Honour stated that he was satisfied that the applicant was entitled to some discount in being sentenced, by reason of the assistance she had provided. As is usual, his Honour did not give particulars of the assistance in his remarks on sentence. It has not been suggested on the hearing of this application that the applicant was not entitled to a discount in sentencing by reason of the assistance she had provided or that the amount of the discount allowed by his Honour was inappropriate. 
     
      
    13   The steps taken by Judge Rummery in arriving at the final sentence for the offence charged in the first count, which his Honour regarded, correctly, as the more serious offence and as being the sentence which should reflect the total criminality of the applicant, were as follows. Taking into account the objective facts of the offences and the subjective circumstances of the applicant, his Honour considered that an appropriate starting point, before any adjustment, would be imprisonment for a term of 14 years. His Honour then made a reduction ""in the order of one-third”, so as to take into account the absence of remissions in New South Wales (see s 16 F of the Crimes Act).  His Honour then applied a discount of ""slightly less than 30 percent"" for the assistance provided by the applicant and thereby arrived at a head sentence of six years eight months. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Considering the prisoner's prospects of rehabilitation, given her young age, the fact that she is without previous convictions, her antecedents generally, the support she has from her family, I assess her prospects of rehabilitation at higher than average. This assessment I take into consideration in fixing a non-parole period."" 
        
       
      
    14   His Honour then fixed a non-parole period of four years eight months, being 70 percent of the head sentence. 
     
      
    15   The first submission made by counsel for the applicant was that the starting point of 14 years adopted by his Honour was too high for an offence of possession of a trafficable quantity only of heroin of 139 grams, in circumstances where the offender had not been shown to have been herself involved in the importation, even allowing for the fact that the sentence his Honour was imposing was intended to reflect the total criminality of the applicant, including that manifested in the applicant's two offences of being in possession of moneys reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime. It was submitted that the applicant's criminality in being in possession of the heroin should be regarded as that of a middle level drug distributor in possession of a trafficable quantity of a prohibited drug for the purposes of supply. It was further submitted that sentences imposed for offences of that kind under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act should be taken as affording some guidance to the sentence which should properly have been imposed on the applicant. 
     
      
    16   In written submissions and orally at the hearing of the application, counsel for the Crown conceded that the starting point of 14 years adopted by his Honour was too high. In my opinion this concession was properly made and, accordingly, I am satisfied that error in the sentencing process has been established. 
     
      
    17   The second submission made by counsel for the applicant was that his Honour had erred in setting the non-parole period as high as 70 percent of the head sentence. In written submissions counsel referred to the part of his Honour's remarks on sentence which I have already quoted, in which his Honour said that he assessed the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation as being higher than average and said that he would take this assessment into account in fixing the non-parole period. It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour had clearly intended to set a non-parole period which bore a lower than average proportion to the head sentence. Yet his Honour had actually set a non-parole period which bore a high proportion to the head sentence. 
     
      
    18   I consider that this submission also has been made good. This Court has not always spoken with one voice on what should be the usual range for the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence in the sentencing of Commonwealth offenders. See, for example, R v Bernier (1988) 102 A Crim R 44; R v Behar (NSWCCA 14 October 1998 unreported); R v Stitt (1988) 102 A Crim R 428. However, the authorities do show that a non-parole period of 70 percent of the head sentence, if within range, is towards the top, and not the bottom, of the range. 
     
      
    19   In the present case the sentencing judge clearly intended, for reasons which his Honour stated and with which I agree, to set a proportionally lower than normal non-parole period, yet his Honour set a non-parole period of 70 percent of the head sentence, which was a proportionally higher than normal non-parole period. 
     
      
    20   Although his Honour clearly understood that the applicant was to be sentenced in accordance with the Commonwealth Crimes Act, and not in accordance with the New South Wales Sentencing Act, it would appear to me that his Honour was influenced in sentencing this Commonwealth offender by what is common sentencing practice under the New South Wales Sentencing Act. Under s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act the additional term of a sentence is not to exceed one-third of the minimum term unless the court decides there are special circumstances and it is fairly common practice to impose sentences in which the minimum term, that is the period of imprisonment which the offender must serve, is 75 percent of the total sentence. A sentence imposed under the Sentencing Act in which the minimum term is only 70 percent of the total sentence might properly be described as a sentence in which the minimum term is proportionally lower than usual. However, as I have noted, in sentencing for Commonwealth offences under the Crimes Act (Cth) a different sentencing practice has developed. 
     
      
    21   In the present case I consider, having regard to the matters which his Honour himself identified in his remarks on sentence, the non-parole period should have been fixed at or about 60 percent of the head sentence. 
     
      
    22   As error has been demonstrated, it is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the applicant. 
     
      
    23   I have already referred to the objective facts of the offences and the subjective circumstances of the applicant. The point really at issue between the parties was what starting point the Court should adopt in sentencing the applicant. Counsel for the applicant suggested a starting point of between four to six years. Counsel for the Crown suggested a figure in the vicinity of 11 to 12 years. 
     
      
    24   It would seem to me that the starting point which should be adopted is a figure in the vicinity of the figure suggested by counsel for the Crown 
     
      
    25   Earlier in this judgment I summarised the arguments of counsel for the applicant in support of the submission that the starting point of 14 years adopted by his Honour was too high. I also noted the Crown’s concession that a starting point of 14 years was too high and my opinion that this concession by the Crown was properly made. However, I do not accept that the applicant’s criminality was merely that of a drug dealer in possession of a trafficable quantity of heroin of 139 grams, who had not herself been shown to have been involved in any importation of drugs. The sentencing judge said in his remarks on sentence that the ostensible business of the company for which the applicant worked was the selling of mobile telephones. It is, in my opinion, clearly implicit in his Honour’s remarks that his Honour was satisfied that the real business of the company was the importation of prohibited drugs. The applicant was one of the two directors and shareholders of the company, the other director and shareholder being Uzabeaga, for whom she was working and with whom she was having a sexual relationship. It can be inferred, in my opinion, that the applicant was aware of the real business being carried on by the company. Furthermore, the applicant had on numerous occasions remitted money overseas and by asking for the further offence to be taken into account in sentencing her acknowledged that these moneys were the proceeds of crime. She should be taken as knowing that the moneys were the proceeds of sales of prohibited drugs and the remittances were payments to the overseas suppliers of drugs which had been imported into Australia. 
     
      
    26   If a figure of the order suggested by counsel for the Crown is selected as a starting point and an appropriate deduction is made by reason of s 16G and a further appropriate deduction is made for the assistance provided by the applicant, one arrives at a head sentence of approximately five years. It seems to me that would be an appropriate head sentence. If the non-parole period is fixed at 60 percent of the head sentence, then a non-parole period of three years is arrived at. 
     
      
    27   I would propose that leave to appeal be granted, that the appeal against sentence be allowed, that the sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Rummery on 12 November 1998 be quashed and that in lieu of those sentences the applicant be sentenced on the first count to a term of imprisonment of five years commencing on 26 June 1998 with a non-parole period of three years commencing on 26 June 1998 and expiring 25 June 2001 and that the applicant should be sentenced on the second count to a fixed term of imprisonment of 15 months, to be served concurrently with the sentence on the first count. 
     
      
      MEAGHER JA: I agree. 
       
      KIRBY J: I also agree. 
       
      MEAGHER JA: That will be the order of the Court.

       REGINA v Sanjeev Kumar DHINGRA  
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1   Meagher JA: The Court is now in a position to give judgment. I will ask James J to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2   James J: This is an application brought by Sanjeev Kumar Dhingra for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District court on 7 May 1999 by his Honour Judge Mahoney, after a jury had found the applicant guilty of a charge of contravening s83G(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Commonwealth). 
     
      
    3   The actual charge against the applicant was that between 13 January 1993 and 1 February 1993 the applicant applied for a stay permit on the basis of satisfying a criterion for a permit because of being married to another person, Angeline Singh, whereas at the time of the application the applicant did not intend to live permanently with the other person in a genuine and continuing marital relationship. 
     
      
    4   The applicant was sentenced by Judge Mahoney to a head sentence of 15 months to date from 31 March 1999 being the date on which the jury returned its verdict, the applicant to be released after 12 months upon entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for three months. The applicant was also fined $3,000. 
     
      
    5   By the Migration Legislation (Amendment) Act 1994 certain sections of the Migration Act 1958 were renumbered and amended in some respects. Section 83G of the Act became s243 and was somewhat amended. The maximum penalty for a breach of this provision of the Migration Act was and remains imprisonment for two years. 
     
      
    6   The facts of the offence were concisely stated by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    7   The applicant came to Australia from India on a visa. He made three attempts to remain in Australia permanently. The first two attempts, in which he claimed to be a refugee and then sought to rely on compassionate grounds, were both unsuccessful. He subsequently made a third attempt, in the course of which he committed the offence under s83G of the Migration Act. On 13 January 1993 he went through a form of marriage with a young woman named Angeline Singh. On 23 January 1993 the applicant returned to India. He applied for permission to enter Australia on a permanent basis, relying on his marriage to Angeline Singh. Angeline Singh took certain steps to facilitate the applicant’s application. In October 1993 the applicant re-entered Australia. 
     
      
    8   In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge referred to some of the subjective circumstances of the applicant, who at the time he was sentenced was 38 years old. The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was otherwise a person of good character and that while in Australia he had been employed for a considerable period as a security guard by the State Rail Authority of New South Wales. However, his Honour thought that good character was of less significance on a charge of this kind than it would ordinarily be, in that a person of known bad character would be unlikely to be able to gain entry into Australia, in any event. 
     
      
    9   His Honour stated in his remarks on sentence that he considered that the offence was objectively serious, that what the applicant had done struck at this country’s right to determine for itself who should be permitted to enter into the country and on what terms and that there was a need for a sentence to be imposed which would serve the purpose of general deterrence. 
     
      
    10   His Honour was informed that there was no previous case anywhere in Australia of a person being sentenced for a contravention of s83G of the Migration Act. His Honour was referred to a decision of this Court in R v Troutman (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal 7 March 1997). Troutman and a co-offender had been convicted and sentenced for a conspiracy to defeat the execution of the Migration Act.  
     
      
    11   There have been further court proceedings since the applicant was sentenced by Judge Mahoney. On 29 July 1999 Levine J granted the applicant bail pending the hearing of this appeal. It was a condition of the grant of bail that the applicant be released into the custody of officials of the Department of Immigration & Multicultural Affairs and be kept in the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre. Pursuant to the grant of bail the applicant was released into the custody of officials of the Department and placed in immigration detention at the Detention Centre. When he was so released he had served three months and 29 days of his sentence. 
     
      
    12   On 14 September 1999 the applicant commenced proceedings in the Federal Court, seeking certain declarations and an order in the nature of habeas corpus directed to the Minister for Immigration. Certain preliminary questions have been decided in those proceedings in the Federal Court, including that the applicant was not an “unlawful non-citizen” under s243(2) of the Migration Act. The proceedings in the Federal Court have not yet been fully disposed of. 
     
      
    13   On 11 October 1999, on the application of the applicant and without any opposition by the Crown, the conditions on which the applicant had been granted bail were varied, so as to delete the condition requiring the applicant to be released into the custody of officials of the Department and be kept at the Detention Centre. The applicant was released from the Detention Centre on 12 October 1999. He had spent a total of two months 14 days in the Detention Centre. 
     
      
    14   Two principal submissions were made by counsel for the applicant in his written submissions. It was submitted that the sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive. It was further submitted that there was such a disparity between the sentence passed on the applicant and the sentences passed by the same sentencing judge on the co-offenders, Angeline Singh and her mother Maya Singh, as to give rise to a legitimate sense of grievance in the applicant. A further submission which was made on the hearing of the application was that the minimum term of the sentence passed by his Honour bore too high a proportion to the total length of the sentence. 
     
      
    15   In my opinion, the first submission should be upheld. The sentence passed on the applicant was manifestly excessive, even after taking into account the evident purpose of s83G and the need for general deterrence, and the appeal should be upheld on this ground. 
     
      
    16   His Honour imposed a head sentence of 15 months. In his remarks on sentence his Honour said that, in fixing the sentence, he had taken into account “the fact of the Sentencing Act in New South Wales, which precludes a prisoner from looking forward to remissions”. In other words, his Honour, as he was required to do, took into account s16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. It is generally accepted that the discount which should be given under s16G in order to allow for the absence of remissions in New South Wales should be approximately one-third. When a discount of this order is added on to the head sentence imposed by his Honour, one arrives at a head sentence which is close to the maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed for a contravention of s83G, that is two years. His Honour, while observing that the offence was serious, did not say anything in his remarks on sentence to suggest that he regarded the offence as being in, or close to, the worse class of offence under s83G. Apart from being imprisoned, the applicant was, of course, also fined the not insubstantial amount of $3,000. 
     
      
    17   As I have already indicated, the sentencing judge was referring to the sentence in the matter of Troutman. Troutman was sentenced to a sentence of 12 months with a recognisance release period of six months, after being found guilty by a jury of conspiring to defeat the execution of the Migration Act. Troutman had entered into a conspiracy to procure arranged marriages, so that immigration applications could be made with a view to deceiving departmental officers into recommending or approving the grant of resident status in Australia. Troutman’s criminal conduct was considerable. The conspiracy was carried into execution over a number of years. There were a number of arranged marriages and Troutman benefited financially from the carrying out of the conspiracy. In the course of carrying out the conspiracy, he recruited Justices of the Peace to falsely attest signatures on documents. Troutman stood trial and showed no contrition. 
     
      
    18   It may be that the sentence passed on Troutman was lenient. Indeed, Hulme J, who delivered the leading judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal said:- “the sentencing judge would have failed in his duty if he had not imposed a sentence, at least as long as he did”. The sentence passed on Troutman may have been lenient and it cannot be said that Troutman’s case is strictly comparable with the present case. Nevertheless, the sentence passed in Troutman does, in my opinion, emphasise the severity of the sentence passed on the present applicant. 
     
      
    19   It is difficult to compare the sentence passed on the applicant with the sentences passed on Angeline Singh and Maya Singh. Angeline Singh was sentenced for one offence under s83D(1) of the Migration Act and one offence under s83G. For the offence under s83D she was sentenced to a head sentence of three years with a recognisance release order operating after six months. For the offence under s83G she was sentenced to a head sentence of 15 months, with a recognisance release order after three months. In accordance with the Crimes Act, the sentencing judge made a single recognisance release order, to take effect after six months. 
     
      
    20   Maya Singh was sentenced for two offences under s83D of the Migration Act. She was sentenced to a head sentence of three years, with a recognisance release order to take effect after three months. 
     
      
    21   As I have said, the sentences passed on the so-called co-offenders are difficult to compare with the sentence passed on the applicant, having regard (inter alia) to their dual offences, the inclusion of offences under a different section of the Migration Act (s83D) which carried a higher maximum penalty and their different subjective circumstances, but those sentences do tend to suggest that the applicant was treated severely. 
     
      
    22   The submission that the minimum term fixed by his Honour was disproportionately high at 80 percent of the head sentence should also be accepted. It is most unusual for a sentence under the Commonwealth Crimes Act to contain a non-parole period or a minimum term which bears such a high proportion to the length of the head or total sentence. 
     
      
    23   I am, accordingly, of the opinion that leave to appeal should be granted and that the appeal against sentence should be allowed and that the prison sentence imposed by Judge Mahoney should be quashed. 
     
      
    24   It is necessary for this Court to re-sentence the applicant. As I have noted, the applicant served a period of three months 29 days in custody in prison and spent a period of two months 14 days in immigration detention in the Villawood Detention Centre, being a type of custody which, while not fully comparable with custody in prison, imposed substantial restraints on the applicant. If the applicant was to be returned to custody in prison it would be for only quite a short period. The applicant has been fined $3,000. 
     
      
    25   In the special circumstances of this case, I would be minded to impose a fixed term of imprisonment equivalent to the period of custody actually served by the applicant in prison, that is to a fixed term of imprisonment of three months 29 days, to take effect from 31 March 1999. It will be apparent that that sentence has already been fully served. 
     
      
    26   MEAGHER JA. I agree 
     
      
    27   KIRBY J. I also agree. 
     
      
    28   MEAGHER JA: The orders as proposed by James J will, therefore, be the orders of the Court. 
     
      
    29   JAMES J: The sentence of the Court will need to be explained to the applicant by his counsel.

       No: 11083/1989 Frances Irene Sloss - v - State of New South Wales 
        
         
       
      
    Reasons for judgment1     HIS HONOUR: In these proceedings the plaintiff, Frances Irene Sloss, seeks damages for nervous shock arising from the death of her son, Anthony Cameron, while he was a remand prisoner at the Long Bay prison complex. Mr Cameron had been administered an overdose of heroin by another prisoner, who was later convicted of his murder. It seems that that prisoner should not have been in the wing where Mr Cameron was. The defendant, the State of New South Wales, has not contested its duty of care or the breach of it. The only issue on liability is damage. 
     
      
       
      
    2     The plaintiff seeks general damages for what she claims is a psychiatric condition engendered by the circumstances of her son’s death. She also claims economic loss on the basis that that condition has had an adverse affect upon her capacity to conduct her business. The defendant contends that she has proved no more than a normal grief reaction and has failed to establish nervous shock, in the sense of a psychological or psychiatric injury: Coates v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales (1995) 36 NSWLR 1, per Gleeson CJ at 4 and Clarke JA at 19. The defendant also contends that, even if she could prove the psychiatric condition alleged, she has not demonstrated any economic loss attributable to it. 
     
      
       
        
       The son’s death and the plaintiff’s emotional reaction 
        
       
      
    3     Mr Cameron was a child of the plaintiff’s first marriage and was born on 15 June 1953. There is an older daughter of that marriage, Mrs Lynette Cappella, who gave evidence. The plaintiff later remarried but her second husband is also deceased. She gave evidence that she had been very close to her son. This was confirmed by Mrs Cappella, who considered the plaintiff to have been much closer to her brother than to her. 
     
      
       
      
    4     Mr Cameron had been working as a health inspector with the Sydney City Council and, it seems, was also involved in running a night club at Kings Cross. The charge which brought him into custody was conspiracy to import heroin, although he had never previously been in trouble with the police. He was killed on 27 November 1983, when he was thirty years old. There is no evidence before me of the reason for the killing. The plaintiff had visited him that day. In the mid-afternoon, after she had returned home, a nurse at Prince Henry Hospital phoned her to tell her that he had had a heart attack. 
     
      
       
      
    5     The plaintiff arrived at the hospital, where her son was lying on a bed under guard. She was advised to leave the room where he was, and a nurse told her he was dead. She was later required to identify his body in the hospital morgue. At that stage she had not been told anything other than that he had had a heart attack, but she found that difficult to accept as he had not had a heart problem. She was later told by an officer at the prison that the death was under investigation. His clothes were recovered from the hospital, but she had to hand them over to the investigating police the next day. 
     
      
       
      
    6     The plaintiff described her shock and distress on the day of the death. No doubt because of the need to retain the body for investigative procedures, the funeral did not take place till several weeks later. The delay caused her further distress. In the meantime, she became aware that her son had been killed but did not know how. She heard a variety of accounts of the manner of his death. She told Dr Rod Milton, a psychiatrist who examined her for forensic purposes, that one of those accounts was an injection of a lethal substance, and she imagined her son being held down while he struggled for his life. (I should say that, apart from being informed from the Bar table that the heroin overdose was administered by a trick, I have no evidence of exactly how the killing was carried out). 
     
      
       
      
    7     In evidence, the plaintiff described her continuing sadness and distress as a result of the death, saying that she had not had “real happiness” since that time. She said that her son was never out of her thoughts. She told Dr Robert Lewin, a psychiatrist who treated her for some years, that she lost her sense of humour and withdrew from social contact. She also described a disturbed sleep pattern, together with nightmares which appear to relate to the loss of her son. At the time of the death she was the proprietor of a brothel in Kings Cross and she later ventured into a fantasy phone sex business at Maroubra. I shall have more to say about this when I turn to the question of economic loss. For the moment, it is sufficient to record her evidence that after the death she became irritable and short tempered with the girls who worked for her. 
     
      
       
      
    8     Her account was corroborated by her daughter, Mrs Cappella, and also by Mr Richard McBride, a private inquiry agent, former police officer and friend of long standing. Mrs Cappella saw her change from a vibrant, extroverted and gregarious person to someone who was introverted and anti-social. She said that her mother was “absolutely devastated” by the incident, which “just changed her whole life”. She observed her irritability with her staff, with whom she had previously had a good and supportive relationship. Indeed, Mrs Cappella was the target of the same irritability and her relationship with her mother became strained.  
     
      
       
      
    9     Mr McBride described the plaintiff as a pleasant and cheerful woman prior to the death, but observed her afterwards to be “really upset all the time”. She had difficulty speaking of anything other than the death of her son, and he became concerned for her “health-wise”. He lost contact with her in the early 90s but, when he re-established it in more recent years, he found her to be still pre-occupied with her son and deprived of “the outlook on life that she had previously”. 
     
      
       
      
    10     Both Dr Lewin and Dr Milton diagnosed a pathological grief reaction leading to depression. However, the picture is complicated by events in the plaintiff’s life after the death, as well as her poor physical health. She has long suffered from chronic obstructive airway disease, recurrent pain in her neck and lower back due to osteoarthritis, and lower abdominal pain due to diverticular disease. For these she has been treated by a general practitioner, Dr Kwon Kan Tam. When she first consulted Dr Lewin in 1989, she was concerned with the management of her second husband, who was then terminally ill. Although they had been separated, she remained attached to him. Most importantly, at the same time she was facing a claim in the order of $100,000 by the income tax authorities after an investigation of her tax returns for the years 1983 to 1988. 
     
      
       
      
    11     The Australian Taxation Office later remitted that additional tax because the plaintiff was in no position to pay it, but she acknowledged in evidence that the claim caused her serious anxiety and depression. The defendant argues that this was the real source of any clinical depression she has suffered, noting that it was not until the claim for unpaid tax was made, some six years after the death of her son, that she commenced psychiatric treatment.  
     
      
       
      
    12     Reliance is placed upon a report which Dr Lewin prepared for her solicitors on 21 February 1992, in which the doctor wrote of her experiencing “a low-grade but sustained depressive disturbance of a reactive kind during the last two and a half to three years”. While referring to her grief following the death of her son, he expressed the opinion that her “ongoing difficulties with the Taxation Department” appeared to be “the major trigger or precipitant” of her condition. Resolution of those difficulties, he thought, would lead to “a fairly rapid resolution” of that condition. It is clear that that report was prepared for the solicitors for the purpose of their dealing with the plaintiff’s tax problem. Dr Lewin expressed the same view in a supplementary report of 8 October 1993. 
     
      
       
      
    13     However, in a report of 25 January 1995 Dr Lewin, after referring to her financial problems and other difficulties in her life, wrote that “the main source of distress throughout the prolonged period of time” he had known the plaintiff had been “her emotional reaction to the death of her son”. It was in that report that he expressed the diagnosis to which I have referred. In the meantime, late in 1993, she had been relieved of her tax burden.  
     
      
       
      
    14     The defendant challenges the reliability of this opinion, in the light of the earlier reports. On the other hand, Dr Lewin gave evidence that what he considered to be the plaintiff’s “chronic reactive depressive condition” was the result of a number of factors and, observing that the “notion of a linear causality is a notion more for lawyers than doctors”, he adhered to his view that her reaction to the death of her son was the “predominant causal factor”. With the benefit of hindsight, he said, he had given undue emphasis to the taxation problem in the reports of 1992 and 1993. 
     
      
       
      
    15     After careful consideration, I accept Dr Lewin’s explanation of the apparent conflict between the reports. It should be noted that in a report of 31 December 1990, directed to solicitors previously acting for the plaintiff for the purpose of a victim’s compensation claim, he described the death of her son as the “main cause of her depressive symptoms”. He added that the circumstances of the death and its effect upon the plaintiff had been “outlined in detail” in an earlier report to those solicitors. Unfortunately, a copy of that earlier report was not able to be produced. The doctor observed that her depressive condition continued well after the remission of her tax debt. Indeed, in a further report of 7 November 1997, he expressed the opinion that it would be with her “throughout the rest of her days”. In those circumstances, it is reasonable for him to have reassessed the significance of the son’s death as a contributing factor. 
     
      
       
      
    16     However, the defendant also relies on the clinical notes of Dr Tam, the general practitioner who saw her many times over a period of years from mid 1983. It was he who referred her to Dr Lewin in 1989. The plaintiff’s evidence was that she discussed her feelings about the death of her son with Dr Tam on numerous occasions. His notes, which are characteristically brief, contain no reference to any such discussion. On 1 February 1985 she is noted to be “depressed”, but the entry is unexplained. Similarly, a note of 10 November 1987 records her complaint of nightmares, but without elaboration. It is clear that she spoke to Dr Tam about her taxation problem, because on 27 February 1992 he wrote to the Department to explain her physical ailments and to describe the “stress and depression” engendered by her financial difficulties. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    17     On the other hand, in certificates of 18 June and 7 December 1992, both addressed “To whom it may concern”, Dr Tam referred to her “long-standing” or “chronic” depression as a result of her son’s death. It is not clear for what purpose those certificates were prepared. He expressed the same view in a brief report of 10 October 1993 to the plaintiff’s solicitors, and in evidence before me. It may be that in earlier consultations the plaintiff had discussed her grief, but he did not perceive its clinical significance. As he said in evidence, it was not his “field to manage depression”. 
     
      
       
      
    18     Dr Milton saw the plaintiff on 1 May 1989, 5 June 1995 and 17 July 1997. While she told him of her problem with the taxation authorities, the doctor said in evidence that she did not “make a big issue of it”. It seems that his knowledge of the extent of that problem derived from the reports of Dr Lewin, with which he had been supplied before the consultation in June 1995. Nevertheless, his diagnosis remained unchanged and he saw the death as the ‘principal source’ of her continuing depression. In his first report of 1 May 1989, he referred to her pathological grief reaction and the fact that she was close to her son and deeply missed him. He added that “she would have been able to come to terms with his loss if he had died under more normal circumstances”. In his final report, of 7 August 1997, he concluded that she “is unlikely ever to do so”.  
     
      
       
      
    19     The defendant engaged Dr Kenneth Dyball to examine the plaintiff, and he saw her on 27 September 1991. In a report of the same day, he concluded that she had “an abnormal grief reaction”. In the course of the consultation she referred to the tax debt, which was still unresolved at that stage. However, according to the doctor’s evidence, she told him that “it didn’t worry her in any abnormal fashion”. 
     
      
       
      
    20     Dr Dyball was later supplied with Dr Lewin’s reports, which led him to supply a supplementary report of 28 October 1998. In the light of Dr Lewin’s reports of 1992 and 1993, he expressed the view that the association of the death of the plaintiff’s son with her emotional problems was “rather more dubious”. He saw the death as a factor, but considered her financial problems and the death of her husband to be “of equal significance”. He adhered to that view in evidence, noting that whatever “grade of depression” was present prior to the claim for unpaid tax in 1989, it was not “of such intensity” as to induce her to seek psychiatric treatment.  
     
      
       
      
    21     However, I consider that there is force in the observations of Dr Lewin in a supplementary report of 4 May 1998, which addressed the question of why the plaintiff may have left it so long to seek treatment. He considered that she was able to manage “chronic low-grade ongoing depressive symptoms”, tending “to soldier on rather than to complain”. He noted that she was initially somewhat reluctant to consult him, feeling that there was a measure of “social stigma attached to seeing a psychiatrist”. Nevertheless, she did so because her symptoms worsened over the passage of time, as a result of the other factors to which reference has been made. 
     
      
       
      
    22     The plaintiff did not see Dr Lewin between February 1995 and October 1997, a period of about two and a half years. She had been taking medication but stopped doing so sometime in 1995. The defendant contends that this is consistent with a recovery from her depressive condition, following upon her release from her tax liability. However, Dr Lewin saw this as consistent with the fact that her symptoms fluctuated over the years. As to the medication, her evidence was that she ceased taking it because it had side effects which she found disagreeable. On balance, I accept this evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    23     In final address, counsel for the defendant attacked the plaintiff’s credibility, submitting that the proceedings in this Court amounted to “double dipping”. Having been absolved of a substantial debt to the taxation authorities, it was said, she has sought to enhance her good fortune by falsely ascribing her depressive symptoms to the death of her son. Counsel relied upon the understatement of her income in the tax returns which led to the investigation of her affairs as testament to her lack of honesty. However, the evidence before me is insufficient to warrant any conclusion about her personal culpability for any misstatement in those returns. 
     
      
       
      
    24     I do not accept the whole of the plaintiff’s evidence without reservation. She is a woman in her late sixties and I consider that her recollection of events was not entirely reliable. I also think that there were occasions in her evidence when she gilded the lily to some extent. Nevertheless, she impressed me as basically an honest witness. Further, as I have said, her account of her emotional reaction to the death over the years was corroborated in significant respects by her daughter and Mr McBride, whose evidence I accept. 
     
      
       
      
    25     In my view, the plaintiff has established that she has suffered from nervous shock, as that expression is explained in the modern authorities, as a result of the loss of her son. I accept the view expressed both by Dr Lewin and Dr Milton that she has been depressed as the result of a pathological grief reaction. It is true that she has had other distressing experiences, principally the death of her second husband and her tax problem, which deepened her depression and for which the defendant is in no way responsible. Nevertheless, I accept that the tragic event of November 1983 is the source of a significant and enduring level of depression, of which she will never be free. As a result, her mood, her lifestyle, her relationships with others and her capacity to deal with the ordinary vicissitudes of life have been adversely affected. Of course, in the future her continuing depression will merge with the inevitable effects of advancing age and deteriorating health.  
     
      
       
      
    26     I would award $70,000 as general damages. For the assessment of interest, I would attribute sixty percent of that amount to the past. 
     
      
       
        
       Economic loss 
        
       
      
    27     From her mid-teens, the plaintiff has had a varied and, at times, colourful working life. A significant proportion of the evidence and the submissions of counsel related to her business interests in the 80s and 90s, but the issue refined itself in such a way as to enable it to be dealt with fairly briefly. 
     
      
       
      
    28     As I have said, at the time of her son’s death, the plaintiff was the proprietor of a brothel in Kings Cross. In 1986 she set up a fantasy phone sex business, with an associated escort service, in Maroubra. It is her case that that business declined over the ensuing years, one of the reasons being her inability to retain staff because of her irritability. In 1996 she abandoned it and set up another brothel in the Maroubra area. She closed it in September 1997. Again, she claims that her poor relationship with the staff was one of the reasons she did so. In 1998 she did some shift work as a receptionist in a brothel in Banksia, and at the time of the hearing she was running a phone sex and escort business on a limited basis from her home. She has been receiving the aged pension since 1992. 
     
      
       
      
    29     I heard some interesting evidence from Ms Roberta Perkins, a university graduate who has undertaken extensive research into the sex industry. She said that prostitution declined from the mid 1980s because of the fear of AIDS and the reluctance of many clients to use condoms. That decline “gradually started to plateau” as the use of condoms gained widespread acceptance by sex workers and their clients. The plaintiff herself gave evidence to the same effect, expressing the view that it was that decline which led to the development of the fantasy phone sex industry. Ms Perkins also saw significance in limitations upon tax deductions for entertainment, so that businessmen could not claim a deduction for entertaining clients at brothels, together with a general economic downturn. 
     
      
       
      
    30     It is in the light of this evidence that the plaintiff claims past economic loss from 1989, rather than some earlier time. A claim for future economic loss was effectively abandoned by her counsel, in the light of her general physical health. 
     
      
       
      
    31     Both parties relied upon actuarial reports and the author of each report gave evidence. Given the view I have formed about this claim, it is unnecessary to summarise that material. It is sufficient to say that the figures in the report prepared for the plaintiff, based upon her tax returns, show a decline in business income from 1990. In evidence the plaintiff agreed that her business “commenced to ease off in about 1992”, but it may have been somewhat earlier than that. The difficulty she faces is that this could well be attributable to the combination of a number of factors other than depression arising from her bereavement. 
     
      
       
      
    32     She acknowledged in evidence that the fantasy phone sex industry was in its infancy when she ventured into it, but competition developed markedly over the years thereafter. She agreed that her preoccupation with her tax problem diminished her interest in the business, causing it to decline, although she added that she “still had the stress” after she was relieved of that obligation. She added that the phone sex enterprise, being a twenty four hour a day business, was difficult to administer on her own, and the Maroubra brothel was beset by problems with the landlord and the local council. Finally, in the certificate of 27 February 1992 referred to in paragraph 16 of these reasons, Dr Tam expressed the view that her physical health at that time was such that she would be unable to work for more than another year. He adhered to that view in evidence, saying that she should have stopped working by early 1993. 
     
      
       
      
    33     I accept that the depression engendered by the loss of her son affected her relationship with her staff and, generally, made her working life more difficult. I have taken account of that in the award for general damages. However, I am not satisfied that that condition contributed in any significant way to the decline of her business. The claim for economic loss is not made out. 
     
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
      
    34     Accordingly, the plaintiff is entitled to damages assessed in accordance with my conclusion in paragraph 26 of these reasons. The agreed out of pocket expenses, rounded off, are $6,210. No interest is claimed on them. 
     
      
       
      
    35     I request the parties to bring in short minutes to give effect to my reasons. On the question of damages, they should not hesitate to inform me if I have made any technical or procedural error, or have failed to determine any matter in dispute. If necessary, I shall hear argument on costs.

     REGINA v SAMI SALAMEH 
      
       
      
     JUDGMENT 
     1   WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from a re-determination under section 13A of the Sentencing Act 1989, of a life sentence originally imposed on him by McInerney J on 14 April 1989, and backdated to 18 July 1987, that being the date of arrest. 
    2   On 15 December 1998, his Honour re-determined that sentence and, in place of the life sentence, imposed a sentence comprising a minimum term of twenty-three years' penal servitude, similarly backdated to 18 July 1987, and an additional term for the remainder of the applicant's natural life. 
     
      
     The Offence 
      
    3   The offence of murder was committed on 26 May 1987. On that day the applicant and his co-offender, Billy Cox, stole a motor vehicle. At about midday they entered a jewellery shop owned by the victim and his family. Their premises were selected because they were seen to be a 'soft target'. 
    4   Each offender was armed with a shortened pump-action shotgun and was disguised with a stocking over his face. The applicant was also wearing socks on his hands to avoid leaving fingerprints behind. The shotgun carried by the applicant was loaded with two cartridges; it was pumped and the safety catch was disengaged.  
    5   Cox stayed at the door while the applicant went behind the glass display counters which he smashed with the butt of the weapon. Jewellery was removed from the display cases and handed to Cox. 
    6   Members of the victim's family were in the store at the time. The victim, who was at the rear of the premises, entered the store front where he confronted the applicant. Almost immediately the shotgun of the applicant was discharged into his chest. He died within one or two minutes from the massive effects of a shotgun blast discharged at close range. 
    7   The applicant pleaded not guilty at his trial but was convicted. At the hearing of the section 13A application, his Honour acceded to the invitation to deal with the offence upon the basis of felony murder rather than as a case of specific intent. His Honour said that he was not able to find, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant had deliberately pulled the trigger with the intention required for murder, although he had some suspicions in that regard, related in particular to the ballistics tests which showed the weapon was not prone to accidental discharge. 
    8   The objective criminality of the applicant his Honour assessed as follows: 
     
      
       
       ""This was a most serious offence. The applicant entered the premises disguised, with a shotgun pumped and the safety catch off ready to fire. Even allowing for what the applicant alleged was an accidental discharge, which I have some doubt about, to go into a jewellery shop to effect a robbery with a shotgun fully loaded ready to fire indicates that the applicant contemplated the use of that weapon if he was thwarted in his attempt to carry out the robbery"". 
       
      
    9   His Honour's description of the seriousness of the offence could not in any way be challenged. It was not questioned on this application. Moreover, any suggestion to the effect that felony murder is a less serious offence than one involving a specific intent should, in my view, be rejected as lacking in foundation. Indeed in Mills, Court of Criminal Appeal, 3 April 1995 Gleeson CJ rejected such a proposition. 
    10   In addition to the conviction for murder the applicant was also found to have been guilty of larceny of a motor vehicle and of possession of a shortened firearm. He was sentenced by his Honour to imprisonment for four years and eight years respectively for those offences. By reason of the life sentence, his Honour declined to set any non-parole period for either offence. 
     
      
     The Subjective circumstances:  
      
    11   Before appearing for sentence on 14 April 1989, the applicant had collected numerous convictions for break and enter, stealing, larceny or attempted larceny, as well as convictions for goods in custody, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, receiving, assault and use firearm in a public place. His record had commenced in the Children's Court and he had served several terms of imprisonment. 
    12   After being sentenced for the murder, but before the hearing of the section 13A application, he had received further sentences for offences of armed robbery, larceny of a motor vehicle, possession of an unlicensed pistol, possession of means of disguising his face, and being armed with intent to commit a felony.  
    13   These charges related to two separate instances of criminality pre-dating the murder occurring on 21 January 1987 and 21 May 1987. They led to substantial concurrent terms of imprisonment. 
    14   The sentences related to the January offences, imposed by Gallen DCJ comprised two sentences each of four years' penal servitude for offences of possess unlicensed pistol and larceny of motor vehicle, and two sentences each of eight years' penal servitude for possessing means of disguise with intent, and being armed with intent. A non-parole period was fixed in relation to those matters of seven years. They were specified to commence from 19 April 1989, the date on which the applicant was sentenced. 
    15   The sentences for the May offences were imposed by Knight DCJ and comprised a sentence of thirteen years' penal servitude for armed robbery, and three years for the larceny of a motor vehicle. They were backdated to 18 July 1987, the date of the applicant's arrest on the murder charge. No non-parole period was specified although his Honour indicated, for the assistance of the Parole Board that, but for the life sentence, he would have fixed a non-parole period of ten years. 
    16   The May offences and the murder, it should be noted, were committed while the applicant was on bail for the January offences. 17   While serving these sentences the applicant escaped from Goulburn Correctional Centre on 20 July 1993. While at large he stole a motor vehicle. In addition he was charged with, and pleaded guilty to an offence of armed robbery in company. 
    18   Upon his re-arrest, he was sentenced by McDevitt DCJ in respect of the escape, to a fixed term of penal servitude for three years to date from 14 August 1995, that date being the date, calculated under the transitional provisions then in force, as the expiry date for the longest of the pre-existing determinate sentences. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of two years' penal servitude, and eighteen months, respectively for armed robbery and for larceny of a motor vehicle. The commencement date may not have been entirely correct but, if so, it was only out by a matter of days and no point was taken on the application in relation to it. 
    19   The applicant has been classified E2 and has been on protection while serving these sentences, at least in recent years. By the time he appeared for re-determination he was aged thirty-four years. His Honour noted that he had been unmanageable from an early age. He left school, at the age of fifteen years, with a record of aggressive behaviour that had become so bad as to lead to his referral, at the age of ten years, to the North Ryde Psychiatric Centre. Although treatment was recommended, his mother (who had his care at the time) did not take advantage of it. 
    20   His background of employment was spasmodic. He is an inveterate user of marijuana and an associate of the criminal element. He has a history of non co-operation with the Probation & Parole Service. His record, while serving the various sentences, was one of non co-operation with the prison authorities, of suspected involvement in attempts to escape and of involvement in standover tactics. He had shown some signs of co-operating in more recent times, but the assessment made by his Honour was that he had shown little effort overall to rehabilitate himself. His Honour's assessment in this regard is summed up in the following passage of the reasons for sentence: 
     
      
       
       ""The applicant's shocking criminal history and present background cause uncertainty in relation to the question of his rehabilitation. I believe there is a serious question as to the extent to which he would represent a danger to the community on being released to parole. On present indications there is a substantial basis for concluding that he will commit further crimes if he is released. This is not a case of an uncharacteristic aberration. It is a case of an offender who has manifested a complete contempt of the Courts and procedures of law in this country. In such a case retribution, deterrence and protection of society require that a more severe penalty is warranted than would ordinarily be the case"". 
       
      
      
     The principles applied:  
      
    21   His Honour noted that, because of the period spent serving the sentences imposed for the other offences, the applicant had served relatively little time exclusively referable to the offence of murder. Upon his Honour's calculations, the sentences imposed by Gallen DCJ would have expired, with a seven year non-parole period, on 18 April 1996, and those imposed by Knight DCJ, assuming a nominal non-parole period of ten years, would have expired on 20 May 1997 - perhaps more correctly 17 July 1997, the difference again being immaterial for present purposes. 
    22   His Honour reached the conclusion, based upon the decision of Barr J in Fenech 4 December 1997 unreported, that, in re-determining a life sentence, he was to take into account any offences or sentences imposed after the life sentence in order to ensure that the applicant served an appropriate sentence for the murder. It was upon that basis that he paid regard to the various offences noted above and to the sentences imposed in relation to them, as well as to the behaviour of the applicant while in custody. 
    23   His Honour expressly noted, consistent with the decision in Spinks, Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 August 1997 that the question of totality applied both to the minimum term and the additional term. As to the latter aspect, after noting the applicant's moral capability, his history of offending and his lack of remorse, his Honour concluded that the case was one requiring an additional term for the remainder of his life, because of the need for him to be carefully monitored when released. 
     
      
     Grounds of appeal: 
      
    24   It was submitted that his Honour fell into error in the approach taken so far as he relied upon Fenech.  
    25   In that case Barr J had said at page 18: 
     
      
       
       ""I think in view of these authorities that the proper approach in re-determining a life sentence is to take into account subsequent offences and sentences not only for the purpose of ascertaining the applicant' stage of rehabilitation but in order to fashion a re-determined sentence which will ensure that the applicant does not go unpunished or insufficiently punished for offences for which he is sentenced after the life sentence. I think that the principle enunciated by Hunt CJ at CL in Regina v Purdey (1982) 65 A Crim R 441 applies to cases like this one just as it applies to life sentences which are imposed on prisoners already serving sentences. 
       
      
    26   But, if there was any doubt about this matter it has been removed, in my opinion, by the enactment by the Parliament of the 1997 amendments to the section. One of the changes was the insertion of sub-section (4A), which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ‘(4A) In considering such an application, the Supreme Court is to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the life sentence was imposed, and all offences, wherever committed, of which the person has been convicted at any time (so far as this information is reasonably available to the Supreme Court)’."" 
         
        
       
      
    27   This approach has been applied by a number of Judges of this Court, at first instance, for example: Sales Studdert J, 7 November 1997; Robinson, Abadee J, 28 November 1997; Picknell Wood CJ at CL, 10 November 1998; Alexander, Kirby J, 1999, NSWSC 413; Gidley, Bell J 1999, NSWSC 498. 
    28   It was submitted, however, that it was a principle that had to be applied subject to the totality rule described in Thomas, Principles of Sentencing, 2nd ed (1979), pages 56-57, as approved by the High Court in Mill (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       ""The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is 'just and appropriate'. The principle has been stated many times in various forms: 'when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total, it is always necessary for the Court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong': 'when ... cases of multiplicity of offences come before the Court, the Court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences.'"" 
       
      
      
       
      
    29   It was submitted that his Honour erred, in adopting a mathematical exercise, and in then attempting to ensure that appropriate sentences were imposed in relation to each of the offences, in particular, in relation to the offence of murder for which the re-determination was to be carried out. 
    30   It is beyond question that the totality principle does apply to re-sentencing under section 13A. So much has been made clear by the decision of this Court in Gary James Boreland, Court of Criminal Appeal, 2 August 1994. I am unable to see any significant difference in the approach which was favoured by Barr J in Fenech and that approved in Mill and in Boreland - that is, so long as the principle expressed is understood as one which requires an assessment to be made of to the appropriate sentences for each offence, followed by a review of the manner in which the overall sentence is structured, including questions of concurrence or accumulation, in the light of the principle of totality. 
    31   That principle has been subject to examination in recent times by the High Court, in particular as to the manner in which it should be applied. In Pearce (1998), 156 ALR 684 at 694, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ ,observed: 
     
      
       
       [45] ""To an offender, the only relevant question may be 'how long', that may suggest that a sentencing Judge or appellate Court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A Judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality. 
       
      
       
      
       
       [46] Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision. It is, then, all the more important that proper principle be applied throughout the process. 
        
         
        
       [47] Questions of cumulation and concurrence may well be affected by particular statutory rules. If, in fixing the appropriate sentence for each offence, proper principle is not applied, orders made for cumulation or concurrence will be made on an imperfect foundation. 
        
         
        
       [47] Further, the need to ensure proper sentencing on each count is reinforced when it is recalled that a failure to do so may give rise to artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders or otherwise distort general sentencing practices in relation to particular offences."" 
       
      
    32   In accordance with the principle expressed in Mill as explained in Pearce, his Honour was required to consider what was an appropriate sentence for each of the offences and then to apply the totality principle to ensure that the criminality involved in all of them was appropriately but not doubly punished. 
    33   I am not persuaded that his Honour took any other approach, it being clear from the remarks on sentence, that his Honour had not overlooked the application of this principle. His Honour observed at one point, “I take into account the question of non-parole periods on the question of totality of sentence”. As I have observed previously, his Honour also expressly stated that “the question of totality not only applies to the minimum term but to the additional term”. 
    34   The sentencing exercise which his Honour had to take into account was, no doubt, complicated by the fact that the applicant had been sentenced to a series of sentences for offences both preceding and following the offence of murder. 
    35   By reason of section 13A(5)of the Sentencing Act 1989, it was necessary for his Honour to backdate the murder sentence to the date of the first remand. It was not possible for him to accumulate the sentence upon any of the other sentences. His Honour was, however, bound to take into account the sentences imposed by Gallen and Knight DCJJ, as well as the sentences he had imposed, back in 1987, for offences other than the murder, in order to undertake the exercise required by Pearce, and then to achieve a result which reflected the totality of the criminality. In so doing it was open to him to foreshorten the sentence for the offence of murder so as to achieve a total result that reflected all of the criminality involved, without any element of double punishment. 
    36   I am not persuaded, from a careful reading of his Honour's judgment, that he overlooked that principle. However, even if the matter were to be regarded afresh, I would not consider the sentencing order, which was in fact imposed, to have been manifestly excessive. When the totality of the criminality involved is taken into account including the fact that the applicant had been found guilty of, or had pleaded guilty to, one count of murder, one count of possess unlicensed pistol, four counts of larceny of motor vehicle, (including the offence of which he was also convicted at his murder trial), one count of armed robbery, one count of armed robbery in company, one count of being armed with intent, one count of possess means of disguise with intent, being armed, one count of escape, and one count of possess a shortened firearm, it is evident that the submission, in this regard, must fail.  
    37   The mere reciting of that litany of offences, in the light of the applicant’s criminal history, his subjective circumstances establishes, I would have thought, beyond question that this sentence was not manifestly excessive. 
    38   I would propose that, while leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal be dismissed.39   NEWMAN J: I agree.40   FOSTER AJ: I agree.41   WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will be as I propose.

     TUESDAY 21 SEPTEMBER 1999 
     
     REGINA v. MICHAEL ALFRED JOHN KNEEBONE 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
     
    1   SPIGELMAN, CJ: I agree with Greg James J and Smart AJ. 
    2   GREG JAMES, J: 
     
      
     Nature of the appeal 
      
    3   This appeal was heard on 6 August 1999 and at the conclusion of argument we ordered that the extension of time sought be granted, the appeal upheld and a new trial ordered, reserving our reasons therefor. The following are my reasons for joining in those orders. 
    4   The appellant had been indicted and tried on two counts. This is an appeal from a conviction on one count of, on or about 24 February 1995, having sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation without consent under s.61J of the Crimes Act 1900, the other count being a charge of indecent assault in circumstances of aggravation upon the same complainant between 19 December 1993 and 18 December 1994, an offence under s.61M of the Crimes Act. The appellant was acquitted of that charge. The circumstances of aggravation in each case were that the complainant was at the time under the age of 16 years and under the authority of the appellant. 
    5   In consequence of his conviction, the appellant was sentenced to a minimum term of six years penal servitude to commence on 20 February 1998 and an additional term of three years. 
     
      
     Evidence on appeal 
      
    6   The appeal originally came before us on 27 May 1999 but due to the state of the list was unable to be heard. In consequence of what we were then told about the basis of the appeal, the matter was re-listed and the applicant, without opposition by the Crown, admitted to bail. An opportunity was thereby afforded to the Crown to put on evidence in reply to certain affidavits which it had been conceded might be read on this appeal, of the appellant's wife, who was also the complainant's mother, and of the appellant's barrister and solicitor. No evidence was put on by the Crown nor was it sought to cross-examine the witnesses. Those affidavits relate to the circumstances surrounding the decision by both the Crown and the defence not to call the wife, the evidence she swears she could have and can give at trial and the failure of defence counsel to seek certain directions relating to complaint evidence. The evidence in those affidavits was admitted by consent, is unchallenged and should be accepted. 
     
      
     Grounds of appeal 
      
    7   Various grounds of appeal against conviction had been filed and subsequent to the matter coming back before us, notice was given by the appellant of an intent to seek to rely upon two supplementary grounds of appeal. It is to those two grounds that the affidavits to which I have referred relate. 
    8   The original grounds were:- 
     
      
       
       ""1. The learned trial judge erred in allowing evidence to be given of out of court representations made by the complainant to June Saillard. 
       
      
      
       
       2. The learned trial judge failed to adequately and/or properly direct the jury in relation to out of court representations made by the complainant. 
       
      
      
       
       3. The learned trial judge failed to adequately and/or properly direct the jury in relation to the terms of the out of court representations made by the complainant and the delay in the making of complaint of sexual assault upon the complainant by the appellant. 
       
      
      
       
       4. The learned trial judge erred in failing to warn the jury as to the potential unreliability of the complainant's evidence pursuant to s.165 Evidence Act 1995. 
       
      
      
       
       5. The verdict of guilty is unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
       
      
      
       
       …"" 
       
      
    9   The supplementary grounds are:- 
     
      
       
       ""5A. The failure of the Crown to make adequate and proper enquiries as to the availability of NB [the appellant's wife and the complainant's mother] and the detail of her recollection of relevant events to the allegations by the complainant caused a miscarriage of justice; alternatively 
       
      
      
       
       5B. A miscarriage of justice was caused by the failure of the Crown to call NB to give evidence at the trial of the appellant."" 
       
      
    10   The Crown did not oppose the raising of those supplementary grounds. These latter assert as grounds of appeal one of the matters relied upon by the appellant in the original written submissions in support of the last of the grounds originally asserted. 
     
      
      
     The ""unsafe"" ground 
      
    11   The original formulation of that ground as a basis for asserting a miscarriage of justice has occurred at trial is no longer appropriate (Fleming v. R. (1998) 158 ALR 379). 
    12   It is clear after examination of the written submissions that, by that ground the appellant sought both to assert that the evidence, as it was at trial, was such that it was not reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty (M v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487; Jones v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275) and that there was procedural irregularity in the conduct of the trial, in each case leading to a miscarriage of justice. 
    13   Since the evidence on both counts was almost entirely, and was, where crucial, solely, that of the complainant, the acquittal of the appellant was relied upon in support of the first submission on this ground that the jury should have been in doubt on both counts due to inconsistency or lack of credibility. 
    14   In addition, asserted unexplained and unreasonable delay in complaining, inconsistency between the terms of that complaint and the circumstances of the event as later asserted in evidence by the complainant, the family dynamics as revealed in the evidence and a number of matters concerning what are said to be inadequacies in the trial judge's directions, particularly on how the jury might properly use the evidence of complaint, are also relied on as a ""constellation"" of features which, in combination, it is asserted, taint the appropriateness of the conviction. 
    15   It was also a complaint that the trial judge had failed to warn the jury as to various reasons, including her age, said to go to the potential unreliability of her evidence notwithstanding a request and s.165 of the Evidence Act 1995. Further it was argued that it was necessary that the jury be instructed that the appellant could not be found guilty in sole reliance on the evidence of the complainant unless the jury were satisfied that the complainant was a reliable and truthful witness in respect of the material issues in the case and it was contended that the absence of such a direction, particularly in the absence of a s.165 direction, tainted the summing up. 
     
      
     Rule 4 and the directions 
      
    16   The Crown contended that as no objection was taken by trial counsel to the matters now raised concerning the adequacy of those directions, leave to argue them is required pursuant to Rule 4. The affidavit of trial counsel is directed, in part, to explaining that no tactical gain was sought to be achieved by the admitted failure to object. Whether that would in another case be sufficient, here, the Crown has, however, conceded that, taken as a whole, the directions as to complaint and delay in complaint and as to the appropriate course the jury should be instructed they should take when considering the evidence of the complainant raise concerns: (see Regina v. Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12) and further accepts that there was a risk that his Honour's otherwise appropriate directions concerning possible explanations for the delay in complaint may have been undermined by his Honour's reference to reasons not the subject of evidence. Thus he, thereby:- 
     
      
       
       ""May have unwittingly misled the jury into assuming that there was in fact some other reason, unexpressed by the complainant, but know to the judge for her silence."" ( 
       Regina v. Williams 
        [1999] NSWCCA 9 at para.26.) 
       
      
    17   In the light of that concession, I would have considered it appropriate that leave be granted in respect to grounds dealing with those matters. However, when one has regard, in the context of the matters raised by the original grounds, to the matters raised by the appellant's supplementary grounds of appeal, which matters the Crown concedes, raise in the circumstances of this case, a miscarriage of justice, it is not necessary for me to deal with those grounds challenging the trial judge's directions in any further detail, than to say that I, too, share the concerns the Crown has expressed, particularly because the Murray direction in such a case needs to be clear and forceful having regard to the matters examined by this court in Regina v. Dwyer [1999] NSWCCA 47, in the judgment of Dunford, J. at paras.13-20 and that if complaint evidence is to be admitted as of right or by leave, the basis for its admission and use and the dangers associated with it and the proper instruction for the jury need careful consideration: Graham v. Regina  (1998) 157 ALR 404. 
     
      
     The missing witness 
      
    18   The absence at trial of the evidence of the complainant's mother in circumstances which it is contended do not adequately justify the Crown's decision not to call her, she being, on the evidence of the complainant, a material eye-witness to the very event charged founded the second submission originally made in support of the ""unsafe"" ground and is now the focus of the supplementary grounds. 
     
      
     A summary of the trial 
      
    19   The complainant gave evidence that her parents, having separated, she had lived with her father for a substantial period of time and then later with her mother at premises in Bathurst where her mother was living with the appellant. She asserted that shortly after commencing to live with her mother and the appellant, he had committed the acts the subject of the first count. 
    20   Other evidence was elicited from her of other incidents said to illustrate guilty passion or relationship. 
    21   On the second count, she gave evidence that on 24 February 1995, when she was 14 years of age, she had arrived at home from school and that after a short discussion with the appellant, she went to her room. She alleged that a short time later he came to the room, abused her verbally, hit her heavily in the face causing her nose to bleed (staining her clothing), thereafter struck her a number of times, pushed her against a wall and choked her with his hands around her neck (leaving marks), threw her onto a bed, removed her clothing and despite her attempts to get away, forced sexual intercourse upon her while she was screaming in protest and for help. She asserted that during the intercourse her mother opened the door to the room, stood at the doorway, looked at what was occurring and said, ""That's enough"". She said she looked at her mother who walked away leaving the door to the room open. She said that the appellant continued intercourse for a short while then got off her and left the room. 
    22   She said that subsequently while she was in the bathroom attempting to wash herself, she was pushed by the appellant and fell into the bathtub, hitting her head on the back of the bath. She got out of the bathtub, washed her face, started to pack her bags and her mother came to her asked what had happened. She replied, ""Like you don't know"". After she ascertained the whereabouts of the appellant, she grabbed her bag and ran leaving the house and going to the outside of a hotel further down the street where she spoke to passers by while crying and obtained sufficient money to get a cab. In due course, she went to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Saillard where injuries and blood staining, consistent with the assault in the bathroom and consistent with certain of the physical injuries she claimed to have suffered in the bedroom, were photographed. Subsequently she spoke to a police officer about that assault saying nothing about the enforced sexual intercourse. She was examined by a doctor that night but again made no reference to a sexual attack. 
    23   She gave as her reason for that that the appellant had told her, ""He'd hunt me down and kill me if he seen me on the street"" and that he had threatened, before she left the house, to break her nose. Neither of those threats appeared to relate particularly to possible disclosure of a sexual nature to the assault. 
    24   About a year or so after the incident in Queensland, in discussion with Gina Waits, Mrs. Saillard's daughter, in response to some gentle questioning, she said: "" … my mum's boyfriend had raped me"". 
    25   Subsequently, after Mrs. Saillard raised the possibility of a report to the Department of Community Services, the complainant said that she had been raped by her stepfather. 
    26   This account encapsulates the allegations, stripping them of circumstantial detail which might well have been considered by a jury to have been important on issues of credibility. In particular on that issue, it is notable that the complaint in respect of the assault by the appellant in the bathroom made on 24 February 1995, resulted in an almost immediate charge of the appellant, with having assaulted the complainant occasioning to her actual bodily harm. Although due to appear at the Bathurst Local Court on 27 March 1995 to answer that count, the appellant travelled to South Australia. He was convicted in his absence and subsequently returned to New South Wales in May 1997 by which time the sexual offence allegations had come forward. 
    27   The appellant had been interviewed in 1995 as to the alleged assault and had given an account denying allegations that he had struck the complainant several times in the face in her room, that he had occasioned her nose to bleed or that he had in that room attempted to choke her but admitting an altercation in the bathroom in which he knocked her into the bath. This interview was tendered in evidence at the trial. 
    28   The appellant's wife had denied any assault had occurred when spoken to by the police shortly after. 
    29   The appellant gave sworn evidence of an argument and the altercation in the bathroom but notwithstanding evidence of injuries consistent with the assault of the complainant, denied striking or choking her. He also denied sexually attacking the complainant. He denied the events alleged to be the basis for the indecent assault count. 
    30   Notwithstanding, that on the evidence of the complainant, her mother was a material eyewitness whose evidence might crucially affect the jury's decision on the disputed event the Crown did not call her but sought a Jones v. Dunkel direction in its favour because the defence had not called her. As will appear from matters I will deal with more extensively later, in particular that the Crown had not sought to interview the witness, it was hardly open to the Crown to seek a favourable direction on the basis the jury should consider the witness in the defence ""camp"". 
    31   On 24 April 1998, the complainant's mother was called by the defence and gave evidence on sentence. The Crown did not cross-examine. The trial judge drew her attention to what the complainant had asserted about her presence during the sexual assault and she denied anything like that had happened. 
     
      
     Evidence in this court 
      
    32   In her affidavit of 6 May 1999 in this court, the mother denies having seen the sexual assault or saying the things her daughter alleged. She says she gave a statement to the police about the assault and was contacted by the police before the trial about a subpoena and told she was on the list of witnesses. She attended the trial and stayed throughout ready to give evidence. She was not interviewed by either side. 
    33   The appellant's solicitor says in his affidavit that the Crown Prosecutor at the end of the first day of trial approached the defence barrister and solicitor in their chambers at the courthouse enquiring whether the defence intended to call the mother to give evidence. It was pointed out to the Crown Prosecutor that her statement formed part of the brief upon which the appellant had been committed for trial. The following morning, the Crown Prosecutor advised the defence that he probably would not call the witness as ""he had formed the opinion that her evidence would be unreliable"". The defence solicitor did not enquire as to the basis on which that opinion had been formed. He further deposes that it had been accepted by the defence that the prosecution would call the witness and for that reason she had not been interviewed. 
    34   After the Crown Prosecutor had informed the defence that he had decided not to call her, it was decided by the defence not to call her since no proof had been obtained and the defence were not aware from her what she might say as to the allegations of the complainant, particularly, seeing her ""defacto husband having sex with her daughter and saying the words 'That's enough' or something similar"". He asserts that it is his recollection that the decision was made not to call her because of ""what we believed to be the state of evidence of the complainant and where it stood in relation to the other witnesses"". He said:- 
     
      
       
       ""I was of the view as well that [she] may not have been truthful to the police when she gave the statement at the Bathurst Police Station about the circumstances of the alleged physical assault."" 
       
      
    35   He further expresses the belief that the Crown Prosecutor before the trial, when informing the jury panel of potential witnesses, included the name of the witness and her address as a Crown witness 
    36   Defence counsel has, in his affidavit, given evidence generally confirmatory of the solicitor's evidence. 
    37   It is submitted that the absence of this evidence where credibility is so crucial has led to a miscarriage of justice. The Crown has, given what it asserts are the very unusual circumstances of this case, arrived at the view that the matters raised in relation to the supplementary grounds together with the additional matters raised in relation to the original grounds, have led to a miscarriage of justice and submitted that the appropriate course is to order a re-trial as such miscarriage can be more adequately remedied by such an order than by any other order which the court is empowered to make: s.8(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
     Submissions 
      
    38   Both counsel have provided detailed written submissions in particular dealing with the role of a Crown Prosecutor in relation to calling witnesses at trial for which we are grateful. Those submissions extensively review the law here and abroad. There is little if any difference between the submissions as to the law we should apply. 
     
      
     The Australian position 
      
    39   The High Court of Australia in The Queen v. Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563 at 575 laid down a number of general propositions as being applicable to the conduct of criminal trials in Australia:- 
     
      
       
       ""1. The Crown Prosecutor alone bears the responsibility of deciding whether a person will be called as a witness for the Crown. 
       
      
      
       
       2. The trial judge may but is not obliged to question the prosecutor in order to discover the reasons which led the prosecutor to decline to call a particular person. He is not called upon to adjudicate the sufficiency of those reasons. 
       
      
      
       
       3. Whilst at the close of the Crown case the trial judge may properly invite the prosecutor to reconsider such a decision and to have regard to the implications as then appear to the judge at that stage of the proceedings, he cannot direct the prosecutor to call a particular witness. 
       
      
      
       
       4. When charging the jury, the trial judge may then make such comment as he then thinks to be appropriate with respect to the effect which the failure of the prosecutor to call a particular person as a witness would appear to have had on the course of the trial. No doubt that comment, if any, would be affected by such information as to the prosecutor's reasons for his decision as the prosecutor thinks it proper to divulge. 
       
      
      
       
       5. Save in the most exceptional circumstances, the trial judge should not himself call a person to give evidence. 
       
      
      
       
       6. A decision of the prosecutor not to call a particular person as a witness would only constitute a ground for setting aside a conviction if, when viewed against the conduct of the trial taken as a whole, it is seen to give rise to a miscarriage of justice."" 
       
      
    40   In discussing the circumstances in which a miscarriage might be occasioned by the failure to call a witness, the court said:- 
     
      
       
       ""In our formulation of the sixth proposition we have omitted the reference to misconduct, intending thereby to broaden the approach so as to focus directly on the consequences, objectively perceived, that the failure to call the witness has had on the course of the trial and its outcome. It is not necessary to postulate misconduct of the prosecutor as an essential condition precedent to a miscarriage of justice. No doubt in the great majority of cases of this kind an appellate tribunal which finds a miscarriage of justice to have occurred will trace that miscarriage to a wrong exercise of judgment by the prosecutor which led to the witness not being called. In cases where there has been no error of judgment there will be less likelihood of a miscarriage resulting from the failure to call the witness. Nevertheless the absence of testimony from a witness may lead to a miscarriage of justice without any error having occurred. … So, if a prosecutor fails to call a witness whose evidence is essential to the unfolding of the case for the Crown the essential question is not whether his decision constitutes misconduct but whether in all the circumstances the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory. (at 577-578)."" 
       
      
    41   In Whitehorn v. The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657, Deane, J. (at 663-664) characterised the obligation of a prosecutor for the Crown in these terms:- 
     
      
       
       ""In performing the function of presenting the case against an accused, a Crown Prosecutor must act with fairness and detachment and always with the objectives of establishing the whole truth in accordance with the procedures and standards which the law requires to be observed and of helping to ensure that the accused's trial is a fair one."" 
       
      
    42   Dawson, J., for his part, said at 674-675:- 
     
      
       
       ""[a]ll available witnesses should be called whose evidence is necessary to unfold the narrative and give a complete account of the events upon which the prosecution is based. In general, these witnesses will include the eye witnesses of any events which go to prove the elements of the crime charged and will include witnesses notwithstanding that they give accounts inconsistent with the Crown case. However, a prosecutor is not bound to call a witness, even an eye witness, whose evidence he judges to be unreliable, untrustworthy or otherwise incapable of belief. And if the number of witnesses available for the proof of some matter is such that in the circumstances it would be unnecessarily repetitious to call them, then the selection may be made. All witnesses whose names are on the indictment, presentment or information should nevertheless be made available by the prosecution in order that they may be called by the defence and should, if practicable, be present at court. … No doubt all of these observations are merely aspects of the general obligation which is imposed upon a Crown Prosecutor to act fairly in the discharge of the function which he performs in a criminal trail.""  
       
      
    43   The guidelines of the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions issued by the DPP in March 1998 say:- 
     
      
       
       ""[t]he Crown should generally call all apparently credible witnesses whose evidence is essential to the complete unfolding of the Crown case or is otherwise material to the proceedings. If a decision is made not to call a witness where there are identifiable circumstances establishing that his or her evidence is clearly unreliable, the Crown should where possible assist the accused to call such a witness by making him or her available. … Mere inconsistency of the testimony of a witness with the Crown case is not grounds for refusing to call the witness. … A decision not to call a witness otherwise reasonably to be expected to be called should be notified to the accused a reasonable time before the commencement of the trial with an indication of the reasons for the decision."" 
       
      
      
     New South Wales Bar Rules 
      
    44   The New South Wales Bar Rules, by Rules 62 and 66B provide:- 
     
      
       
       ""62. A prosecutor must fairly assist the court to arrive at the truth, must seek impartially to have the whole of the relevant evidence placed intelligibly before the court, and must seek to assist the court with adequate submissions of law to enable the law properly to be applied to the facts. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       66B. A prosecutor must call as part of the prosecution's case all witnesses:- 
       
      
      
       
        (a) whose testimony is admissible and necessary for the presentation of the whole picture; 
       
      
      
       
        (b) whose testimony provides reasonable grounds for the prosecutor to believe that it could provide admissible evidence relevant to any matter in issue; 
       
      
      
       
        (c) whose testimony or statements were used in the course of any committal proceedings; and 
       
      
      
       
        (d) from whom statements have been obtained in the preparation or conduct of the prosecution's case; 
       
      
      
       
        unless:- 
       
      
      
       
        (e) the opponent consents to the prosecutor not calling a particular witness; 
       
      
      
       
        (f) the only matter with respect to which the particular witness can give admissible evidence has been dealt with by an admission on behalf of the accused; or 
       
      
      
       
        (g) the prosecutor believes on reasonable grounds that the administration of justice in the case would be harmed by calling a particular witness or particular witnesses to establish a particular point already adequately established by another witness or other witnesses; 
       
      
      
       
        provided that:- 
       
      
      
       
        (h) the prosecutor is not obliged to call evidence from a particular witness, who would otherwise fall within (a)-(d), if the prosecutor believes on reasonable grounds that the testimony of that witnesses is plainly untruthful or is plainly unreliable by reason of the witness being in the camp of the accused; and 
       
      
      
       
        (i) the prosecutor must inform the opponent as soon as practicable of the identity of any witness whom the prosecutor intends not to call on any ground within (f), (g) and (h), together with the grounds on which the prosecutor has reached that decision."" 
       
      
    45   The authorities in Australia have been extensively reviewed recently by the Queensland Court of Appeal in The Queen v. Wilson CLS (1997) QSC CA 38 by the majority, Fitzgerald, P. and Lee. J. 
     
      
     Overseas 
      
    46   In the United Kingdom, the position is covered by the propositions laid down by the Court of Appeal in The Queen v. Russell-Jones (1995) All ER 239 where the court said:- 
     
      
       
       ""… 
       
      
      
       
       4. The next principle is that the prosecution ought normally to call or offer to call all the witnesses who gave direct evidence of the primary facts of the case, unless for good reason, in any instance, the prosecutor regards the witness' evidence as unworthy of belief. In most cases the jury should have available all of that evidence as to what actually happened, which the prosecution, when serving statements, considered to be material, even if there are inconsistencies between one witness and another. The defence cannot always be expected to call for themselves witnesses of the primary facts whom the prosecution has discarded … If what a witness of the primary facts has to say is properly regarded by the prosecution as being incapable of belief, or as some of the authorities say 'incredible', then his evidence cannot help the jury assess the overall picture of the crucial events; hence, it is not unfair that he should not be called … 
       
      
      
       
       5. It is for the prosecution to decide which witnesses give direct evidence of the primary facts of the case. A prosecutor may reasonably take the view that what a particular witness has to say is at best marginal. 
       
      
      
       
       6. The prosecutor is also, as we have said, the primary judge of whether or not a witness to the material events is incredible, or unworthy of belief. It goes without saying that he could not properly condemn a witness as incredible merely because, for example, he give as account at variance with that of a larger number of witnesses, and one which is less favourable to the prosecution case than that of the others. 
       
      
      
       
       7. A prosecutor properly exercising his discretion will not therefore be obliged to proffer a witness merely in order to give the defence material with which to attack the credit of other witnesses on whom the Crown relies. To hold otherwise would, in truth, be to assert that the prosecution are obliged to call a witness for no purpose other than to assist the defence in its endeavour to destroy the Crown's own case. No sensible rule of justice could require such a stance to be taken."" 
       
      
    47   The Crown has drawn to our attention the decisions The Queen v. Wilson (1997) 2 NZLR 500 and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Horn 150 Atlantic Reporter 872 [1959], both of which generally accord with the conclusions reached in the Australian cases. 
    48   The position in Canada appears to differ to some degree: Regina v. Cook 114 CCC (3d) 481 but that may be explicable by the development of the Canadian law of pre-trial disclosure and the availability there of an opportunity for the accused to cross-examine its own witness. 
     
      
     Ascertaining unreliability 
      
    49   Since both experience and logic confirm that merely because a witness' evidence is inconsistent with or contradicts other evidence, it need not be untrue, it is necessary that a prosecutor whose decision is under examination be able to point to identifiable factors which can justify a decision not to call a material witness on the ground of unreliability: see Apostilides (supra, at 576); DPP Guidelines (supra), at least if the suggestion of attempting to obtain an improper tactical advantage is to be avoided. It is therefore necessary for the prosecutor to take appropriate steps, including, where necessary interviewing witnesses to be able to form the opinion. 
    50   In reaching a view as to reliability, it is clear that it is not an adequate basis to conclude that the witness is unreliable, merely because the witness' account does not accord with some case theory which is attractive to the prosecutor. An approach, whereby the witness is not called at all or is left to the defence to call because the witness' evidence is seen as not fitting the prosecution's view of the case is likely to lead to a miscarriage of justice. Apostilides (supra) deals with the consequence of such an approach. A case theory should accord with the evidence. The prosecutor should not espouse a theory and tailor a case accordingly: Regina v. Anderson (1991) 53 A. Crim. R. 421. 
    51   The advisability, if not necessity for a conference is reinforced by the decisions in Tran v. Magistrates' Court of Victoria & Anor (1998) 4 VR 294; Regina v. Armstrong (1998) 4 VR 533, where the prosecutor refused to interview the witness or to consider notes proffered by counsel for the defence indicating the substance of the evidence it was anticipated the witness would give; and R. v. O'Brien (1996) 66 SASR 396 particularly in the judgment of Doyle, CJ. at 398-399. There the prosecutor had sensibly spoken to and proofed the witness before concluding that there was a clear allegiance on the part of the witness to the accused. 
    52   In Regina v. Shaw (1991) 57 A. Crim R. 425, the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal had regard to an assertion that the witness was unreliable and found the assertion unacceptable in the absence of the prosecutor having, by an appropriate technique such as conferring with the witness, satisfying him or herself properly of the witness' capability to give relevant and truthful evidence. In relation to an assertion that the prosecution should be able to disregard witnesses inconsistent with the general case. Nathan, J. said (at 450):- 
     
      
       
       ""… eye witnesses do not belong to a camp, but are within the class of persons from whom juries expect and are entitled to hear. The characterisation of witnesses being in camps is unfortunate. It necessarily implies that the prosecutor might choose to call only those witnesses favourable to his camp. This is an absolute derogation of a prosecutor's responsibilities."" 
       
      
    53   I agree with his Honour's observations. They accord with the generally accepted view of the role and responsibility of a Crown Prosecutor (see, for example, Richardson v. The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 116. 
     
      
     Other matters 
      
    54   It is not necessary in this case, since the witness did not give evidence, to consider whether the defence was placed at an improper disadvantage by being forced to call the witness. Nor is it necessary, since the Crown has not, even now, exposed the prosecutor's reasons, to consider whether the decision was based on some view he might have, even if mistakenly, considered that the Crown might be deprived of an appropriate opportunity to cross-examine the witness, since, in proper circumstances, resort might have been made to an application under s.38 of the Evidence Act. This observation is not to be taken as an indication by me as to whether such an application might properly be made or as to how any such application should be resolved. Section 38 of the Evidence Act refers to the concept of the witness being ""unfavourable"". In the context of a criminal case, care may have to be given to the question of what ""unfavourable"" to the Crown means. That concept will not necessarily be satisfied simply because the witness' potential testimony does not accord with some prosecutor's view of the appropriate ""camp"" or some case theory which does not accord with all the otherwise reliable evidence.  
    55   There have been various views taken in the court as to the meaning of ""unfavourable"" in s.38 of the Evidence Act (see Regina v. Milat (Hunt, CJ. at CL., unreported 23 April 1996); Regina v. Lozano (CCA, unreported 10 June 1997); Regina v. Souleyman (1996) 40 NSWLR 712; Regina v. Pantoja (CCA, unreported 5 November 1998); Regina v. GAC (CCA, unreported 19 December 1996); Regina v. Adam & Adam (Wood, CJ. at CL., unreported 24 November 1998, 3 December 1998, 11 December 1998); on appeal Regina v. Adam & Adam (CCA, unreported 23 July 1999); Regina v. Patsalis & Spathis (No. 10) (Kirby, J., unreported 10 August 1999). Those views properly reflect the object of s.38 of the Evidence Act to provide a wider entitlement than s.53 of the 1898 Act, its predecessor. That provision dealt with the circumstance of a witness proving ""adverse"". However, the full width of any entitlement under s.38 and the criteria for the proper exercise of discretion to permit cross-examination remain to be settled. Other questions remain as to the appropriateness of calling witnesses known or expected to give unfavourable evidence and the eliciting or refraining from eliciting particular testimony against the interest of or not to the advantage of the party calling the witness. There is much about the application of the section still to be resolved. Interestingly, as a matter of history, the notion of unfavourability was considered by Willes, J. in Greenough v. Eccles (1859) 2 CB (NS) 786 at 805 in the context of the then newly enacted s.22 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the ancestor of s.53. That decision became the seminal authority on similar statutory provisions throughout the common law world concerning the rights of a party who had called a witness that proved ""adverse"". Willes, J. rejected the concept of ""adverse"" under the section as merely amounting to ""giving unfavourable evidence"" and considered that ""unfavourable"" could be equated with giving ""evidence opposed to the interests of the party who calls him"". Such a test would not extend to failing to give evidence which might have been expected and which would have assisted the calling party's case and is narrower than those applied in some of the decisions to which I have referred. 
    56   Should there be a problem as to whether a witness, likely to give unfavourable evidence or to refrain from giving favourable evidence, should be called or as to how a witness, giving or refraining from giving such evidence, might be questioned, a ruling should be sought preferably in advance or alternatively, immediately. 
     
      
     Conclusions 
      
    57   In summary, it is the duty of a prosecutor to determine what witnesses will be called. He has the responsibility for ensuring that the Crown case is properly presented. He also has the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown case is presented with fairness to the accused and to the court. He does not perform that duty by seeking to avoid having placed before the court evidence which he is not entitled to regard as unreliable and yet which ill accords with a theory of the accused's guilt. 
    58   In the way in which the complainant's evidence was given, the evidence of her mother was essential to the unfolding of the narrative and crucial on credibility (see Semeviratne v. The King (1936) 36 All ER 36 at 48-49). 
    59   Not calling the witness without having a principled basis for not so doing accorded ill with the traditional notion of the functions of a prosecutor for the Crown. (See the remarks of Fullagher, J. in Ziems v. Prothonotary (1957) 97 CLR 279 at 294.3.) 
    60   In the present case, no basis is put forward in evidence which would have entitled the Crown Prosecutor on the basis of unreliability to have formed the view that the witness should not properly be called in the Crown case. There was, for example, no evidence that the witness was unwilling to speak to the police; there was no attempt to conduct a conference with the witness and the witness' statements to the police concerning the physical assault may have been explicable on a basis other than being in the accused's ""camp"". 
    61   I am of the view that by reason of the failure to call the witness, occasioned, as it appears to be, by a failure to adopt an appropriate course to enable proper consideration of any question of unreliability, a miscarriage has occurred. In my view, the supplementary grounds of appeal should be upheld. It remains to consider whether, in all the circumstances, the appropriate order is for a new trial. 
     
      
     Order for a new trial 
      
    62   It was submitted in support of the ""unsafe"" ground that the evidence at trial was such as not to support the verdict. In the absence of the wife's evidence, it was necessary for the jury to evaluate the credibility of the complainant in the context of the directions that were given and the appellant's sworn evidence denying the offence. I have already referred to the jury's verdict on the other count. Taking that into consideration, and even having regard to the constellation of features drawn to our attention by counsel for the appellant including the discrepancies and inconsistencies asserted to affect the acceptability of the evidence of the complainant, I consider this is not such a case as Jones (supra). In that case, unlike here, the delay may have deprived the appellant of a ""cast-iron"" defence by way of alibi. Delay here either strikes at or supports the complainant's credibility depending upon a proper assessment of her reasons justifying her unwillingness to divulge the sexual aspect of the attacks. 
    63   The two counts at the trial related to qualitatively different conduct. Specifically, the count of an assault involving an act of indecency was supported by evidence that had a degree of equivocation with respect to the element of indecency that was not present in the evidence with respect to the second count. 
    64   Particularly in the context of her mother not having given evidence, it does not seem to me that I can conclude that the complainant's account so suffered from discrepancies and matters adversely affecting her credibility or that there was such an inconsistency arising by reason of her account not being accepted on the first count as to reflect so adversely upon her credit generally that a jury on her evidence was not entitled on the remaining count to be satisfied of the appellant's guilt. Here, the assessment of the credit of the differing witnesses is so important: Chidiac v. The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 432. 
    65   In so concluding I have had regard to what this court held in RJC (unreported 1 October 1998) and Dwyer (supra). 
    66   Further, when considering the application of the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and whether an acquittal should be entered (s.6(2)) or whether an order for a new trial would more adequately remedy the miscarriage (s.8(1)), I have had regard to the possibilities that complaint evidence might not be admitted at a subsequent trial; that more stringent directions might be given on such matters as the examination of the complainant's evidence; and the reliability of that evidence; and the matters already referred to in this judgment as to the appropriate directions as to complaint (if it is admitted): see Graham (supra) and s.108(3) of the Evidence Act, but I do not see that there are, on balance, discretionary considerations which would make an order for a new trial in all the circumstances inappropriate. On its face such an order would more adequately remedy a miscarriage arising by reason of relevant evidence not having been called. 
    67   Of course an order for a new trial is permissive. It will be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, particularly in the context of the various matters that have been raised on this appeal, to give consideration as to whether the new trial should proceed. 
    68   SMART AJ: Michael Alfred John Kneebone sought an extension of time in which to appeal, and appeals against his conviction of on 24 February 1995 having sexual intercourse with his de facto stepdaughter without her consent in circumstances of aggravation, knowing that she was not consenting thereto. The circumstances of aggravation were that she was aged 14 and under an authority. 
    69   On 6 August 1999 orders were made extending the time, allowing the appeal, quashing the conviction and ordering a new trial with reasons to be given later. I now give reasons for joining in those orders. 
    70   The appellant was acquitted of a charge of indecently assaulting his stepdaughter (the complainant) between 19 December 1993 and 18 December 1994. Other evidence was led as to acts by the appellant towards the complainant in the nature of sexual advances and displays of passion. 
    71   The appellant complained that the trial judge erroneously admitted evidence and failed to give adequate directions on a number of issues, that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory and that there had been a miscarriage of justice in the Crown failing to have the complainant's mother properly interviewed and a statement taken from her, and in failing to call her to give evidence at the trial. I agree with Greg James J that the verdict was not unsafe or unsatisfactory. 
    72   I also agree that there was a miscarriage of justice in the Crown's failure to investigate what the mother had to say. It is on this ground and the related ground of the Crown failing to call her as a witness on which I express my reasons. The facts of the case are so extraordinary and unique that acute factual and legal difficulties arose in the conduct of the trial. It is necessary to set out the facts in some detail to highlight the issues and the difficulties. 
    73   The parents of the complainant had separated and she had lived with her father. When she was aged about 13 and in year 8 at school she went to live with her mother and the appellant. The evidence suggests that she was no an easy girl to manage. On the afternoon of 24 February 1995 she returned home about 3.30 pm having wagged school for the day. Her mother and the appellant were there. He remarked that she was home early and that it usually took her twenty minutes to walk home and it had only taken her ten minutes. He told her to go to her room and do her homework. She went to her room and closed the door. She said that some time later he came to her room and told her to stand up, he wanted to talk to her. She did so. He then hit her across the face with the back of his hand causing her nose to bleed. He told her not to get blood on the carpet. He said ""Come here, you lying slag"". She went over to him. He hit her a couple more times and then pushed her up against the wall, put both his hands around her throat and started to squeeze. She said that she could not breathe, that he asked her if she could breathe, she shook her head and he said, ""Feels good, doesn't it"". After releasing his hold on her, he hit her again and threw her on the bed. She ended up lying on her back with her legs dangling over the edge of the bed. 
    74   She said that he commented ""Oh, you seemed to enjoy that. See how you're going to enjoy this"". He walked over and pulled her shorts off. She said that she screamed and tried kicking him. After a struggle by her the appellant succeeded in pulling off her underpants. He ""sort of"" threw her over to the side. She tried getting out of the open window. He grabbed her, pulled her back, threw her back on the bed and took his shorts off. She tried to escape through the window again but he pulled her back. He removed his underpants. She leapt from the bed and tried to get out through the door. He ran over, shut the door and threw her back on the bed and pinned her down. She screamed and yelled. He inserted his penis in her vagina and moved backwards and forwards. This hurt. 
    75   The complainant said that she next became aware of the bedroom door being opened and her mother standing in the doorway. Her mother said, ""that's enough"". The complainant said that she said nothing, that the appellant said nothing and that her mother walked away, leaving the door open. The complainant said that the appellant pushed in and out a couple more times, got off and walked out of the room leaving his clothing there.  
    76   She got up, put on some underpants and shorts and went to the bathroom. She wiped herself around the vagina and noticed some blood. As she endeavoured to leave the bathroom the appellant pushed her back into the bathroom and told her to wash her face. There was blood from her nose on her face. While she was in the bathroom attempting to wash her face, he pushed her and she fell into the bathtub striking the back of her head. After the appellant left the bathroom she got out of the bathtub and washed her face. She left the bathroom and went to her bedroom.  
    77   She said that the appellant came to her room and said, ""You've got 10 minutes to get out of my house"". Thereupon she began to pack some bags. While doing this her mother came in and asked her what had happened and she replied, ""Like you don't know"". Her mother did not reply but stood in the doorway. The daughter asked where the appellant was and her mother said he was in the toilet. The daughter grabbed her school bag but no other bag and ran out of the house. She was upset and scared. It was about 4:30 pm. It had been an eventful and traumatic hour.  
    78   The complainant ran on to the verandah of a hotel about five blocks away. A man came to her and asked, ""can I help you"", and she started to cry. The man spoke to the licensee of the hotel, a lady, who came out and spoke to the complainant. She was sobbing, shaking and distraught; indeed, so distraught that she did not want to enter the hotel. The licensee remembered this vividly. Because of the lapse of time (three years) the licensee could not remember accurately whether the complainant was bruised or had blood on her. The licensee arranged for the complainant to use the telephone. She telephoned Mr David Saillard. When she finished speaking the licensee gave her $5 for a taxi to Woolworths in Bathurst where she met a lady who drove her first to the lady's home and then to the Saillard home at Millthorpe, arriving there about 5:30 to 6:00 pm. 
    79   Mr Saillard was a highly qualified nurse and carefully observed the complainant's external injuries. Her face was bruised, her nose was discoloured and there was blood on her lip, across her jawline and on her clothes. It was dry blood. There was swelling to the side of her face and across her jaw and bruising to her ear. Around her neck and upper chest there were red finger marks. There were welts on the complainant's back and a fair sized lump at the back of her head. The lump was red and hot so it was not an old injury. Her face and her hair were ""a real mess"". Photographs of the injuries were taken. Mrs Saillard said that the complainant was very distressed and that the Saillards could not get any sense out of her for at least half an hour. 
    80   Mr Saillard took the complainant to the Millthorpe Police Station. The complainant said that she told Sergeant Anderson, a male officer, about some of what had occurred. She said ""I just told him about the bashing"". She did not tell him about the removal of her clothing or about the appellant placing his penis in her vagina. She stated that before she left the appellant's home he had said that if she told, he would hunt her down and kill her if he saw her on the street. Using excessive gestures he had also threatened to break her nose. As at 24 February 1995 the appellant was aged twenty-eight. He was unemployed at that point. At the trial he was a gardener by occupation. Sergeant Anderson said that at the time she made her statement (about 7:00 pm) the complainant was crying and physically shaking. She was then taken to Blayney District Hospital and examined by Dr Barui at 8:30 pm. He found that she had tender swelling over the right lower jaw, left cheek and back of her head. He did not find any finger marks on her neck or back. There were no marks of bleeding in the nose. There were no other abnormalities.  
    81   Mrs Saillard said that upon the complainant's return from the police and the hospital she was very withdrawn and would neither eat nor drink. She kept bursting out with certain statements which they did not take any further. It took hours to calm and settle her down. She slept on the floor in the bedroom of Mr and Mrs Saillard. She was not coherent - she was too upset. Mrs Saillard had to soak the complainant's clothes in an effort to eradicate the stains.  
    82   The complainant stayed with the Saillards moving with them to Queensland. Mrs Saillard said that for some time after 24 February 1995 the complainant was wary of men and getting close to them.  
    83   The appellant was interviewed by Sgt Anderson on Monday, 27 February 1995. He stated that he was sick and tired of the complainant running away when she could not get her own way. He said that he told her ""to get the fuck out"". He denied striking the complainant on the nose and that he held her against a wall causing her to have difficulty breathing. He said that he entered her bedroom when her mother and she were packing her stuff up. He said that the mother remained in the house from the time the complainant arrived home until the time she left. He denied that he struck her several times in the face.  
    84   The appellant said that he entered the bathroom while the complainant was in there. He believed that ""she was getting her brush, hair ties and shit"". He said that he asked her to move out of the way but she would not move. He said, ""When I went off at her I think I scared her"". He pulled the cabinet door open, knowing that it would strike the complainant if she did not move. After he had struck her with the door she fell into the bath. Her described his tone of voice as abrupt and said that his voice was raised when he told her to move and she did not do so. He said that he got a tin of spray paint and walked out the back to do ""touchups"" on the car. The appellant said that when he last spoke to the complainant in the house she had no injuries. However, she was upset. 
    85   In his evidence in chief the appellant conceded that he lost his temper with the complainant in the bathroom and that his actions in pulling open the cupboard door and striking her on the leg made her go backwards into the bath. Apart from this, he denied striking or touching her in any other way. He denied sexually assaulting her.  
    86   The appellant said that on the complainant's coming home he asked her how she had got home from school so early. She went into her bedroom to do her homework. He and her mother remained in the house. He opened her bedroom door and told her to leave her door open and to open the window ""cause it stinks in here"". He went back to the lounge room and conversed with his de facto wife. Next he was in the doorway of the complainant's room and a confrontation occurred over the way she left the room and over other matters. A little later, the bathroom incident occurred and he went out the back. 
    87   The appellant said that he came back inside the house five to ten minutes later. He saw his de facto wife and his de facto stepdaughter in the latter's bedroom packing her school bag and a couple of white Coles' bags. The appellant said he went into the toilet and on coming out saw his de facto stepdaughter and his de facto wife walking out the front door. The complainant left and her mother came back inside the house. The appellant said he had not seen the complainant again until the previous day (17 February 1998). The appellant's evidence in cross-examination was less than compelling. 
    88   The appellant was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm on 27 February 1995. He did not appear as required before the Court on 27 March 1995. He said he and his de facto wife went to South Australia. There were care proceedings in the Local Court at Orange involving the complainant and the Department of Community Services as a result of which the complainant was permitted to stay with the Saillards as their foster daughter. 
    89   As to complaint, Mrs Gina Waites, a daughter of Mrs Saillard, said that the complainant was not her normal self and that at her mother's suggestion, she spoke to the complainant and tried to ascertain what was wrong. Eventually, she told Mrs Waites that the appellant had laid on top of her and tried to put his penis in but could not get it in all the way. Mrs Waites told her mother. Mrs Waites believed the conversation took place about November 1995. Mrs Saillard said that, after Gina had reported the conversation to her, she spoke to the complainant who, after some general discussion about sexual assault and rape, told Mrs Saillard that the appellant had raped her as well as bashing her. Mrs Saillard, who thought that the conversation had occurred at the end of 1996, reported the matter to Community Services. In January 1997 the police took a statement from the complainant and a medical examination of her took place on 12 February 1997. Assuming that the complaint was made in late 1996 that was about twenty-one months after the event. 
    90   It is against this background that the questions of not interviewing and calling the complainant's mother and the appellant's de facto have to be considered. The appellant's evidence did not satisfactorily explain all of the complainant's injuries so tellingly detailed by Mrs Saillard. At best, it provided some explanation for the bruise on the back of her head. The sexual assault alleged was sandwiched in between the two other assaults, that is, the one in the bedroom and the one in the bathroom. It is hard to regard it as other than one continuous incident. It is also difficult to imagine the complainant being in the condition recounted by the hotel licensee if she had only fallen backwards into the bath and had been ordered out. Her condition was most consistent with an attack of the severity described by her. The appellant was in the unenviable position that a jury was not likely to accept his evidence about the assault not involving the sexual component.  
    91   The appellant was also in considerable difficulty calling his de facto wife. Even allowing for the complainant being difficult to handle, the mother had let her daughter leave the home in the condition she was subsequently found by Mrs Saillard. If the mother said that the daughter was not in that condition when she left home, that would not be easy to accept. There is the further question as to how the complainant got into the condition. The mother's credit would not be assisted by her subsequent conduct including leaving for South Australia with her de facto husband without her daughter and Community Services having to intervene. In effect, the mother surrendered her daughter into the care of the Saillard family. Put briefly, the probable serious inroads into the mother's credit, standing and care of her daughter in cross-examination could have done irreparable harm to the appellant's case. In practical terms, the appellant could not run the risk of calling her even though she would have supported his version. There was the real risk that she would have been seen as supporting him and abandoning her daughter. Yet, she was the only eye witness apart from her daughter and her de facto husband.  
    92   The mother said in her affidavit that she had given a statement to the police on 27 February 1995 in which she stated that she did not see the assault allegedly committed on her daughter. She stated that she gave the police an outline of what she saw happen but did not tell them she had been told about her daughter and the appellant being in the bathroom together.  
    93   The mother stated in her affidavit in these proceedings: 
     
      
     (a) She was present during an argument between her, the appellant and her daughter about wagging school and the cleanliness of her room on the afternoon of 24 February 1995. 
      
      
     (b) Her daughter expressed the wish to leave home and stay with a friend at Millthorpe (near Orange). 
      
      
     (c) Before her daughter left home, she appeared to be walking alright. The mother did not see any injuries upon her daughter.  
      
      
     (d) She did not see her daughter fall into the bath although she had been told by the appellant that he had opened a cupboard, hit her on the leg and caused her to fall into the bath. 
      
      
     (e) She never saw the appellant having a sexual relationship with her daughter. She did not go into her daughter's room and see her with the appellant and say, ""what's going on"" or, ""that's enough"".  
      
      
     (f) She never had a conversation with her daughter that afternoon where she said, ""what's wrong"", and her daughter replied, ""as if you didn't know"".  
      
    94   The mother said that about a week before the trial a police officer telephoned and asked if she had received a subpoena to attend court. She replied, ""no"". The police officer said that he would look into the matter as she was on the list of witnesses. The mother said that she attended at the trial to give evidence on behalf of the prosecution. She sat outside the courtroom all through the trial. No one from the prosecution ever spoke to her or approached her.  
    95   She was never called as a witness at the trial. The prosecution did not tell her that she was not to be called and she was not aware of the reasons why she was not called by the defence. Neither side asked her what she knew. During the trial she was told by the appellant that her daughter claimed that she had seen the daughter and appellant having sex. After the verdict of guilty, she spoke to her de facto husband's barrister and stated that she wanted the Court to know her version of events.  
    96   She was called to give evidence at the sentence hearing on behalf of the appellant with whom she had been living for about seven and a half years. She said that the complainant caused normal teenage difficulties such as skipping school, shoplifting, wanting to go out at night and lying about what she was doing. The complainant and the appellant had a reasonably good relationship. They went to South Australia to be with members of his family. She described his personal conduct which was good and kindly. After counsel had finished leading her evidence, the judge asked her some questions. In reply, she stated that she heard the appellant telling the complainant something like ""if you want to go, go"". The mother said that she did not intervene but she did speak with her daughter and she wanted to go and stay with her friend, Anna Saillard. She denied that she had seen her daughter being raped by the appellant and her daughter's version of events.  
    97   The appellant's solicitor at the trial has stated that, when the trial commenced, the Crown indicated that the mother might be called to give evidence. He believed that she was on a list of witnesses. At the end of the first day of the trial, the Crown prosecutor visited the defence room and asked whether the defendant intended to call the mother to give evidence. Either counsel or the solicitor for the appellant pointed out that her statement formed part of the brief upon which he had been committed for trial. The next morning, before the trial continued, the Crown prosecutor attended and advised that he probably would not call the mother as her evidence would be unreliable. He was not asked on what basis he had formed that opinion. The appellant's solicitor has stated that, in preparation for the trial, discussions with the appellant proceeded on the basis that the Crown would be calling the mother as a witness. For that reason, she was not interviewed. As there is no property in a witness, there was no sufficient reason not to interview the mother although the appellant's solicitor would have had to be careful just to elicit her account of what had occurred, where she was in and about the house between the time the complainant went to her room and the time she left the house, and the physical condition of the complainant.  
    98   The appellant's solicitor said that after the discussions with the Crown it was decided not to call the mother in the defence case. The reasons for this decision are obvious.  
    99   There was a significant departure from proper practice in the Crown not interviewing and not attempting to interview the mother after the allegation of rape had been made in late 1996. It was not a matter to which attention was directed on 27 February 1995 when she was being interviewed about the assaults as it was not known to arise. The Crown knew that the mother was in the house. Any moderately competent investigation required that the mother be interviewed and asked about what had happened.  
    100   From what is know of the mother's evidence, it does raise acute problems. She admits that she did not tell the police when being interviewed on 27 February 1995 about the appellant and her daughter being in the bathroom although the appellant had told her about that. She claims that she did not see any injuries on the complainant before she left home and that the complainant appeared to be talking and walking alright. According to the appellant, the mother helped the daughter pack and saw her off the premises. The difficulty is that if her statements about the assault and the condition of her daughter are unreliable, as they appear to be, and she did not tell the police of the bathroom incident, how much weight, if any, can be given to her denial of witnessing one segment of the assault, namely the alleged sexual assault which occurred between the other assaults.  
    101   The principles relating to the calling or non calling of witnesses by the Crown have been authoritatively restated by the High Court in The Queen v Apostilides (1983-84) 154 CLR 563 at 575. As the Court noted, it did not attempt to deal exhaustively with the responsibility of the prosecutor and it referred back to the Court's earlier decisions. The difficulty in the present case lies not so much in the statement of the principles but in their application.  
    102   At the risk of undue repetition these further principles should be noted: 
     
      
     (a) The Crown prosecutor in deciding how the Crown case will be presented and what oral evidence will be adduced has the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown case is presented with fairness to the accused:  
     Richardson v The Queen 
      (1974-75) 131 CLR at 199. 
      
      
     (b) The Crown prosecutor will often have to take into account many factors, for example, whether the evidence of a particular witness is essential to the unfolding of the Crown case, whether it is credible and truthful, whether in the interests of justice it should be subject to cross-examination, amongst other matters:  
     Richardson 
      at 119. 
      
      
     (c) The prosecutor should decide in the particular case what are the relevant factors and in the light of those factors determine the course which will ensure a proper presentation of the Crown case comformably with the dictates of fairness to the accused:  
     Richardson 
      at 119. 
      
      
     (d) To avoid a miscarriage of justice, a Crown prosecutor should call all available material witnesses. They include those whose evidence is necessary to unfold the narrative and give a complete account of the events upon which the prosecution is based. In general, these witnesses will include the eye witnesses of any events which go to prove the elements of the crime and will include witnesses notwithstanding that they give accounts inconsistent with the Crown case:  
     Whitehorn v The Queen 
      152 CLR 657 at 674 per Dawson J. (An exception exists where there are many witnesses to prove the same point.) 
      
      
     (e) However, the Crown has a discretion not to call in the Crown case an eye witness if the prosecutor judges that there is sufficient reason for not calling the witness, as, for example, where the prosecutor concludes the witness is not reliable and trustworthy or is otherwise incapable of belief. This applies even to a witness who is essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is based:  
     Richardson 
      at 121 and  
     Whitehorn 
      at 674.  
      
      
     (f) The prosecutor's judgment must be based on more than a feeling or intuition. There must be identifiable factors pointing to unreliability or lack of belief in the proposed evidence of the witness. It is not enough that the prosecutor considers that the evidence may be unreliable. Suspicion, scepticism and errors on subsidiary matters will not suffice. The attention of the prosecutor should be on matters of substance and even on these there may be significant differences between the witnesses. It is for the jury to resolve these:  
     Apostilides 
      at 576.  
      
      
     (g) ""In most cases where a prosecutor does not wish to lead evidence from a person named on the indictment"" [or able to give material evidence] but the defence wishes that person to be called, it will be sufficient for the prosecutor simply to call the person so that he may be cross-examined by the defendant and then, if necessary, be re-examined:  
     Apostilides 
      at 576.  
      
      
     (h) Frequently, eye witnesses will be close or have been close to the accused and possibly to the victim. That does not mean that they should not be called by the Crown. It is where it is apparent that the eye witness is so devoted to the accused and his cause that she will not tell the truth as to what happened that the question of the Crown not calling that witness will arise.  
      
      
     (i) Overriding all the particular guidelines and formulations is the general obligation imposed upon a Crown prosecutor to act fairly in the discharge of the function which he performs. That is the guiding and fundamental principle to be kept in mind as new and unusual situations emerge:  
     Whitehorn 
      at 675.  
      
    103   I have considerable doubt whether the mother is necessary to unfold the narrative and give a complete account of the events upon which the prosecution rely. On the complainant's evidence, the mother was an observer for a short period and uttered the words, ""that's enough"". The alleged rape commenced before she came to the door of the bedroom and continued after she left. It was the complainant who attributed the role mentioned to the mother. The mother denies acting as an observer or being aware of the activities of the appellant alleged by the complainant and for that reason her evidence, if true (or if there is a possibility that it is true), is important.  
    104   One consideration is whether in the interests of justice the mother's evidence should be subject to cross-examination (Richardson at 119). Given the unsatisfactory features of her evidence as to other parts of the incident, it is difficult to see how that question can be answered other than in the affirmative. Section 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 then needs to be considered as it allows a party, who called witness, with the leave of the Court, to question a witness as though cross-examining her about evidence given that is unfavourable to the party. Under s38(4) such questioning is to take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness unless the Court otherwise directs. Section 38 makes an important change in the law and removes restrictions which had the effect, on occasions, of making important evidence unavailable and preventing the adequate testing of evidence. The judge has the task of deciding whether the evidence is unfavourable (not favourable) and then whether in the exercise of his discretion he ought to grant leave to cross-examine. The careful exercise of that discretion is designed to ensure that there will be no unfairness. The prosecutor will need to bear this section in mind and also the appellant's desire that the Crown call the mother. The Crown prosecutor would have to consider the alternative course of simply calling the mother and allowing the mother to be cross-examined by the appellant. He could still do this if leave to cross-examine were refused.  
    105   On the material available to this Court, and it is at best doubtful if there will be further significant material, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that there will probably be a miscarriage of justice if the Crown does not call the mother. In practical terms the appellant cannot call her. In fairness she should be called despite the reservations about the evidence. The offence charged is particularly serious and the appellant received a long term of penal servitude (nine years with a minimum term of six years). Apart from the appellant and the complainant, she was the only other person in the house at the critical time. It was the complainant who said that the mother observed the rape and made the comment mentioned. Thus, the complainant rendered the mother's evidence in denial of importance to the appellant.  
    106   The circumstances taken as a whole are somewhat strange. I have assumed that any statement which the mother gives to the police will, in substance, accord with her affidavit in these proceedings. I have deliberately refrained from expressing any final view as there is a possibility that other material of some importance may emerge once the mother is interviewed in some depth and other witnesses are, perhaps, further interviewed or further investigations occur. I do not regard this as likely and I have expressed some provisional views. The Crown took the course of conceding that the mother was a material witness who had not been interviewed about the sexual assault allegations and that there had been no adequate investigation. That sufficed and there was no point in the Crown adducing evidence. The failure mentioned and conceded meant, in the circumstances, that any decision not to call the mother to give evidence could not be soundly based. The whole matter will need to be reconsidered once an adequate investigation has occurred.  
    107   The task confronting the prosecutor is a formidable and lonely one. There are a number of courses of action available. In Apostilides the High Court pointed out that the absence of testimony from a witness may lead to a miscarriage of justice without any error having occurred. Despite the problems with some of her evidence and the reservations about it, this appears to be such a case. Pre-eminently, this is a case where the jury should assess the complainant, the appellant and the mother. Without the mother, the jury may be left with unanswered questions of consequence. The prosecutor will have to address not only the question of whether the mother's evidence would be unreliable but the further question of whether there would, in the special circumstances, be a miscarriage of justice if she were not called.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      (On application to discharge the jury - see p.608 of transcript) 
      
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: Application has been made to discharge the jury now on the basis that the trial has been irretrievably damaged by the fractured process to date.  
    2   This application commenced prior to today and has proceeded before me today, particularly in the context of the Crown attempting to provide some material, whether sufficient or not one is unable to say, concerning the witness whose arrival from Korea is shortly expected.  
    3   The trial has been grossly fractured to date. Mr. Temby, QC. has pointed out of the 15 sitting days that could have been available, seven and a half have occupied the attention of the jury more or less.  
    4   However, my observation of the jury does not indicate to me that the effect upon them has in fact been such as to divert them from their ability to appreciate, as well as it might have been appreciated, the material and the circumstantial evidence in the case in the way in which that evidence has been tendered.  
    5   The interruptions have been most unfortunate. Those interruptions, as I have observed previously, have, in the main, been related to the difficulties created by the late calling of the witness from Korea.  
    6   In the material now made available to me, there appears an indemnity in respect of offences and offences associated with the death of the victims involved in the present charges. There also appears correspondence and undertakings in respect of mutual assistance agreements between Australia and South Korea. It seems highly likely that that material is an inadequate provision of the material that might be necessary for the defence to be able properly to cross-examine the witness on her understanding of the position in which she is placed. 
    7   Further, I note that statutory immunities are referred to in that material as well. These matters bode ill for avoiding further disruption. For the moment I need say no more about that, except that it is contended by Mr. Temby, on behalf of the accused, that the process so far has so fractured the trial that a discharge is now required.  
    8   Whatever may have been the history of the fractured process, in my view no discharge is presently warranted.  
    9   It may or may not be, however, that that which occurs for the future in the context of that history may merit a discharge. In particular I have regard to what I said in the judgment I delivered on the application concerning the increasing frailty of the trial. 
    10   Notwithstanding that the trial has, thanks to a listing misunderstanding, been adjourned until Tuesday, it does not seem to me that the jury is any the worse off now than I expected it would be then. It may, however, be worse off in the future, in which case the consequence, should the application be renewed, Mr. Temby, having reserved the opportunity, as it were, to make a further application, would not necessarily be the same.  
    11   I appreciate also that those individuals charged with the prosecution of the matter before me are doing what they can. That is not the point, however. Mr. Temby, indeed, expressly has accepted that the individuals are doing what they can.  
    12   The issue is whether the trial fairness is or will be so affected and the defence inappropriately handicapped. The issue is one that will, of course, be examined in the light of the principles in Regina v. Glennon (1994) 179 CLR 1 that to a certain extent all parties may have to accept some degree of handicap and nonetheless a trial will be fair. But the importance of this witness and the importance of maintaining the trial are matters which at present do not mind me to grant the application.

    SENTENCE 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    1    HIS HONOUR : On 11 August 1999 Adonis (Eddie) Khouzame was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter of Caglar Vurangunes and guilty of assaulting Gokhan Kumru occasioning him actual bodily harm. 
     
      
       
      
    2    It is necessary to find facts consistent with those verdicts of the jury for the purpose of sentence. I am aware of course that the evidence contained a variety of versions and details of events and the following refers to matters about which I am satisfied to the requisite criminal standard of proof. 
     
      
       
      
    3    In the late afternoon of Sunday 9 November 1997 three teenaged boys, the victims whose names I have mentioned and Erdinc (Eddie) Tustas arrived in North Street Guildford in a motor car owned by Gokhan Kumru’s mother. The boys were of Turkish ethnicity. At least one of them was acquainted with Sarah Dawson, a girl who lived in a house in that street. The exact order of comings and goings is confused but some social exchange took place between the boys and Sarah Dawson as well as with other girls who were passing in the street, Ruby Raad and Lisa McCoy. At some stage the prisoner’s sister Ashty Khouzame was in the vicinity. I should state that I do not accept Ashty Khouzame as a witness of truth. Whilst the motive of the boys for their presence was undoubtedly flirtatious, I find that nothing was said or done by any of them towards any girl which could reasonably be regarded as offensive or provocative. I note that to a large extent Eddie Tustas remained aloof.  
     
      
       
      
    4    Ruby Raad resided in the house next door to the prisoner and his family. Although just under sixteen years of age, she was engaged to be married. Her ten year old brother Mohammed took some objection to his sister’s conversing with the visiting males. He threatened to tell her fiance. Truthfully he could tell that person no more than that his sister was part of a group of boys and girls chatting with each other in a public street in daylight hours. However, the boy Mohammed entered upon the prisoner’s premises and began calling out loudly and his behaviour attracted the prisoner to the front balcony of the upper storey of the house.  
     
      
       
      
    5    Verbal abuse came to be exchanged between the prisoner on the balcony and the visitors who remained outside of the premises in the street. The prisoner testified that in part of the exchange he offered the mild reproof “can you leave my sister and cousin alone and leave”. I do not accept that the prisoner made such a genteel request but even in that version of his there is implication that his state of mind included a desire for the visitors to egress from the area. I prefer as more credible the recounting of Gokhan Kumru who testified: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “He looked down towards me and he said, ‘Get the fuck out of here’, this and that, and I answered back to him and I said, ‘What’s your problem mate?’ and he said, ‘I’ll show you my problem’, and he come down.” 
         
        
       
      
    6    The prisoner did not claim that there had been any preceding complaint from any one of the girls nor that he had observed any one of the visiting boys misconduct himself nor had he seen them do anything which would cause apprehension that they were about to misconduct themselves. I am satisfied that no one of the girls had told him that any attention being paid to her was unwelcome. Ruby Raad was not the prisoner’s cousin nor does the evidence suggest that her fiance was a member of his family. The prisoner and Ruby Raad shared a Lebanese ethnicity. 
     
      
       
      
    7    I am satisfied that the prisoner perceived that the boys were not going to depart immediately and that he formed an intention to drive them away. He descended to the front door where he stripped off his upper garment. This was not a peacemaking gesture. The prisoner armed himself with a piece of wood which apparently had been used as a garden stake. I am satisfied that the items admitted into evidence are the component parts of that piece of wood. The label of garden stake should not give any false impression about the substantial nature of the implement which the prisoner chose to wield. 
     
      
       
      
    8    With this implement the prisoner struck Caglar Vurangunes a blow to the head, the force of which brought him to his knees and caused the damage which set in train ultimate fatality. 
     
      
       
      
    9    A number of the prisoner’s male relatives emerged from the house in close order behind him. His brother Joseph attacked Gokhan Kumru and the prisoner (and possibly others) joined in. That victim sustained injuries including a bloodied and swollen face and bruising on the arm and back. The victims made their way to the car which was driven away. Joseph Khouzame had by then acquired the wood and struck the departing car a blow which broke it into pieces. The foregoing are basic relevant facts. The evidence of course contained a host of peripheral details many of which were the subject of contradiction. It is not necessary to resolve inessential disputes. 
     
      
       
      
    10    Another brother of the prisoner, Brian Khouzame tried to restrain his brothers. Shortly after the departure of the car he, the prisoner together with other male members of his family approached Mrs Dawson and her daughter Sarah who were near their home further down the street. Mrs Dawson testified “they just all came marching up to me, a whole group of men and I was very frightened.” Brian Khouzame addressed Sarah Dawson including the words “Don’t bring any fucking Turks into the street”. This circumstance is not an element in any crime for which the prisoner stands to be punished but his undissenting presence whilst his brother made this statement does nothing to contradict the conclusion that I have reached that he had formed an intention to drive the visiting youths away from the street. Save the rantings of a ten year old boy the prisoner had been given no cause to form such an intention. 
     
      
       
      
    11    At trial the prisoner claimed that he feared attack from the youths and that he had armed himself with the wooden piece and fanned it in front of him in self defence. He claimed that the victim sustained injury to his head when he intruded himself into the arc in which the waving wood travelled. I do not accept that anything of the sort happened nor that the blow was preceded by mutual pushing and shoving between the prisoner and the victim. 
     
      
       
      
    12    At the sentence hearing it was argued that I should find that the prisoner struck only a single blow rather than accept testimony of some witnesses who spoke of multiple blows being struck by the prisoner. As I have found, the blow struck by the prisoner brought the youth to his knees and I infer that the prisoner was well aware that he was thereafter at no real risk of retaliation from him. For the purposes of sentence I accept that it is only proved beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner struck one blow to Caglar Vurangunes but it was a blow which is adequately described by common parlance as a “king hit”.  
     
      
       
      
    13    I record that I also reject the prisoner’s version that his contact with Gokhan Kumru was initiated by the latter placing him in a head lock. 
     
      
       
      
    14    The jury’s verdict demonstrated that they were not satisfied that the prisoner intended to do grievous bodily harm to Caglar Vurangunes and I approach the issue of sentence on the basis that the killing was the consequence of an unlawful and dangerous act by the prisoner, namely the battery with the wood piece. I do not ignore the post mortem measurement which suggested the greater than average vulnerability of the victim to a blow to the head but this was not a case of a moderate blow causing unexpectedly grave damage, the violence in this instance was a full bodied blow with a substantial weapon.  
     
      
       
      
    15    I turn to some subjective matters. The prisoner was aged nineteen at the time of these offences. I have read the report of the psychologist Ms Duffy concerning Mrs Vurangunes which was tendered as a victim impact statement. I have considered it as required by Pt 6A of the Criminal Procedure Act and I do not find it appropriate to use its content to affect the determination of punishment. 
     
      
       
      
    16    The prisoner has no prior convictions. He comes from a close and supportive family. He obviously impressed the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report as well as a psychologist Ms Robilliard. Her interpretation of test results was also favourable although if, as she assessed, his typical mood states demonstrate “warmth, tenderness, non competitiveness and avoidance of tension and conflict” she offers little assistance for analysis of the violent pre-emptive strike which he undertook on Sunday 9 November 1997. 
     
      
       
      
    17    This brings me to a matter which has troubled me, namely whether the prisoner has come to accept responsibility for what he has done and whether he is remorseful and contrite. Of course, he is not obliged so to be but it has been put that I should find these matters in his favour and reflect them in mitigation of sentence.  
     
      
       
      
    18    I have rejected, as necessarily did the jury, the prisoner’s claim of self defence but it is a useful guide to the reality of his recognition of responsibility to observe some matters concerning that claim. I raised the issue with counsel who asked me to accept as I do, that many of the letters of support tendered at the sentencing hearing had been obtained at the behest of family members when the issues of trial had not been determined. Even so, Ms Robilliard, for example, saw the prisoner at Parklea on 9th of this month and she reported (inter alia) 
     
      
       
        
         
          “he said it was the first fight he had had in his life and he was ‘frightened and scared… I did not know what to do’. In his own mind Adonis believes he acted in self defence, however, he entertains profound remorse over the victim’s death. He said he regularly prays for the victim and the victim’s family as well as his own.” 
         
        
       
      
    19    I have found there was no fight antecedent to the prisoner’s arming himself with the piece of wood and the fact was that he struck an essentially defenceless victim. Although the prisoner has stated to Ms Robilliard that he entertains remorse over the victim’s death, his persistent claim of acting in self defence contradicts the proposition that he has recognized his responsibility for the death. 
     
      
       
      
    20    Accepting that some of the testimonials were prepared before verdict, it must also be observed that some bear dates subsequent to it. None of the authors of the letters comprising Exhibit 2 revealed any detailed knowledge of the prisoner’s act. I do not propose to analyse all twenty three letters and two extracted samples will suffice for demonstration. Mr El-Adhami knew that the prisoner had been convicted of manslaughter but asserted that he did not believe that the prisoner was “capable of such an act”. The finding of the jury was otherwise. This is a letter dated September 14th. Mr Jad Pavkovic whom I assume to be a relation of the prisoner’s fiancee Angela Pavkovic stated that he (the prisoner) “does not deserve to be held in prison for a crime he did not commit”. This letter is dated September 4th. The content of the letters does not persuade me that the prisoner has profound remorse for the victim’s death as opined by the psychologist. It is of interest to note that Mrs Tuma a witness called at the sentence hearing understood and still thought that “from what (she had) heard it was an act of self defence”. She had apparently been at a court hearing in 1998 when self defence was an issue being raised but she said the prisoner called her from remand two weeks before giving evidence. He did not take the opportunity then to alter her understanding. 
     
      
       
      
    21    I accept the assertions in the various letters comprising the exhibit mentioned that, these crimes apart, the prisoner is a person of good character. They have not persuaded me that he is contrite for his offences and I have concluded that he clings to the myth that his action was justified in whole or in part by some need for self defence. The consequence of that finding is not, of course to increase sentence but I do not make the finding invited by counsel that the prisoner has genuine remorse and contrition so as to attract particular leniency. 
     
      
       
      
    22    As I have said, the prisoner’s prior good character is supported by these referees together with the opinions of the probation and parole officer and the psychologist Ms Robilliard. The combination promotes a finding which I make that the prisoner is so far as I can predict, unlikely to re-offend. In terms of the question of rehabilitation there should be a determination favourable to the prisoner. The need for sentence to reflect personal deterrence is therefore of a low order.  
     
      
       
      
    23    The issue of general deterrence cannot be ignored. The prisoner did not speak the offensive words to Mrs Dawson that I have quoted and although he was present and in company at the time of their utterance, I do not attribute to him the specific motive which those words suggest but it was nevertheless his intention to make the visitors quit the area. Whatever was the inspiration for the confrontation outside the prisoner’s house, his use of a significant implement to assault an unarmed youth must meet with observable condemnation. The community would expect that such an assault leading to death would attract an appropriate degree of punishment.  
     
      
       
      
    24    During submissions it was said that of all crimes manslaughter could be said to have the broadest spectrum of culpability ranging from what might be described as just beyond accident to just short of murder. That situation can be said to be recognized by s24 of the Crimes Act which specifies a maximum penalty of twenty five years penal servitude for manslaughter with a proviso that a judge in an appropriate case for which nominal punishment is deemed sufficient may discharge a jury from giving any verdict. In my assessment the prisoner’s crime of manslaughter lies at neither extreme. I do not overlook the victim’s particular vulnerability but it is repeated that the killing was in stark terms the result of an armed attack by the prisoner.  
     
      
       
      
    25    I do not accede to the submission of counsel that a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention would be appropriate. 
     
      
       
      
    26    The Sentencing Act requires that the additional term component of a sentence not exceed one third of the minimum term unless there are special circumstances. I consider that there are such circumstances which justify extension of the additional term component during which the prisoner will potentially be at conditional liberty on parole. He is still a comparatively young man being committed to custody on a first occasion. After his release it is desirable that he have objective assistance over a significant period from a person independent of his close knit family to guide him in accepting the reason for his incarceration and re-entering the community with a mature and appropriate attitude. An officer of the Probation and Parole Service would fulfil that role.  
     
      
       
      
    27    The prisoner was in custody for 38 days after being charged and before being bailed. He was returned to custody after the jury’s verdict. I will backdate the sentences to take account of these circumstances. 
     
      
       
      
    28    Adonis Khouzame for the manslaughter of Caglar Vurangunes, you are sentenced to penal servitude for five years, such sentence to consist of a minimum term of three years commencing on 3 July 1999 and to expire on 2 July 2002, together with an additional term of two years to commence on 3 July 2002.  
     
      
       
      
    29    For assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Gokhan Kumru you are sentenced to a fixed term of penal servitude for three months commencing on 3 July 1999 and to expire on 2 October 1999. That fixed term is imposed as it is to be served concurrently with part of the minimum term component of the sentence just imposed for manslaughter. 
     
      
       
      
    30    You will be eligible for parole on 2 July 2002.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
     
     
      
       
      
    1    GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Gibson DCJ of eight and a half years imprisonment with a non parole period of six and a half years for an offence of importing not less than the traffickable quantity of the drug cocaine. The weight of pure drug involved was 712.49 grams. The commercial quantity is two kilograms. 
     
      
       
      
    2    The applicant is aged 52 years and a native of Guatemala. He has resided in the United States since the age of 20. He has grown children from a long standing de facto relationship. He has no prior convictions. Despite his long residence in the United States, he was interviewed and at the sentence hearing, his evidence was given through a Spanish interpreter. The facts are all too familiar. On 6 June 1998 the applicant arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport on an Air Pacific flight which had originated in Los Angeles, making a brief stopover in Nadi, Fiji. The applicant was travelling alone and in possession of a return ticket. A routine search of a backpack, which was part of his luggage, detected the drug concealed in the lining. A booking had been made at the Gemini Hotel, Randwick on the day previous to the applicant's arrival for a stay at that establishment of one day. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The applicant told investigating police, who had been called in by the customs officers, that he had no knowledge of the drug in the backpack which had been given to him by a friend who had told him that if someone offered to buy it from him, he should sell it to them. He claimed that he came to Australia for a holiday. An interview by Federal Police contained, it suffices to say, many prevarications by the applicant. However, in due course, the applicant pleaded guilty before a magistrate and was committed to the District Court for sentence. He gave sworn evidence before Gibson DCJ and conceded that his fare had been paid by a nominated man who had given him the bag to bring to Australia, and he was at the time given $1,000 with a promise of a further $3,000 on return. He admitted that he suspected that there was something illegal in the bag and that the thought that it might be drugs had crossed his mind. He expressed remorse for what he had done and for his lack of candour and attempted deceptions when interviewed by police. 
     
      
       
      
    4    The sentencing judge found, and it is not challenged, that his trip to Australia was purely a commercial venture in the sense that he did have his expenses paid and received, and was to receive further reward for his activity. 
     
      
       
      
    5    Counsel, on behalf of the applicant, essentially advanced two propositions; first that the sentence was manifestly excessive given its departure from what has been recognised in other cases as appropriate range, and second, that the proportion of non parole period to head sentence (a little more that 76 percent) was unjustifiably high. 
     
      
       
      
    6    The appropriate range of sentence for a courier (which the applicant was) who pleads guilty and has no prior convictions (a qualification sought by recruiters of couriers) has been the focus of discussion in this Court. 
     
      
       
      
    7    In R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 the Court (Gleeson CJ, Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J (as he then was)) recognised a pattern of sentences for couriers of substantial quantities of cocaine, of head sentences between eight and a half to eleven years. The particular case involved a quantity of cocaine well towards the top of the traffickable range. The present quantity is a little less than three-eighths of the commercial quantity threshold. Without further analysis, however, it might be said that the sentence imposed by Gibson DCJ of eight and a half years, being at the bottom of the stated range, would not demonstrate a miscarriage of sentencing discretion so as to cause the jurisdiction of this Court to be invoked. 
     
      
       
      
    8    Ferrer-Esis was decided at a time when the sentencing scheme which saw the abolition of remissions was in its infancy, and the observation of sentence pattern was heavily dependant upon sentences imposed prior to the introduction of the new scheme. 
     
      
       
      
    9    In R v Lawson 1997 98 A Crim R 463 James J with whom Hunt CJ at CL (who had given the leading judgment in Ferrer-Esis) and Levine J agreed, observed:  
     
      
       
        
         
         ""..... since 
          Ferrer-Esis 
          the pattern of sentences which have been imposed on couriers who had not provided assistance has tended to be rather lower than the range of sentences indicated by his Honour ..... the great majority of sentences for offences under s233B of the Customs Act involving a traffickable quantity of heroin where the offender has pleaded guilty and had no prior convictions, were less than eight years."" 
         
        
       
      
     10    It is not necessary to discriminate between the different narcotics, heroin and cocaine. 
     
      
       
      
    11    A detailed analysis of the cases which I have mentioned and other cases in which reference to patterns has been made, was conducted in this Court in R v Bernier 1998 102 A Crim R 44. The court there concluded that the pattern of sentence for substantial quantities of drugs identified in Ferrer-Esis, that is to say, eight and a half to eleven years, should now be seen as more appropriate for the importation by couriers of drugs in quantities at the lower end of the commercial range. That conclusion would seem to imply that such a range is greater than that which would be appropriate for a traffickable quantity, or certainly a traffickable quantity which was less than half the amount required to reach the threshold of a commercial quantity. 
     
      
       
      
    12    It has been drawn to the Court's attention that the judgment in Bernier has been the subject of some criticism in a judgment of the Court differently constituted in R v Robertson unreported NSWCCA 6 November 1998. It is not necessary today however to involve this Court as presently constituted in any analysis or debate concerning the correctness or otherwise of observations made in Bernier. 
     
      
       
      
    13    In written submissions on behalf of the Crown, it was conceded that the sentence and the non parole period was at the top of the range for a crime of this type in circumstances where there had been a plea of guilty, but it was contended that it did not follow that the sentencing judge had fallen into error. 
     
      
       
      
    14    Given what has been said in the cases to which I have made reference, I have concluded that the total sentence of eight and a half years should be held to be excessive. Save the attempts at prevarication when first questioned by authorities, the applicant's circumstances disclose no particular features of aggravation. 
     
      
       
      
    15    This Court should proceed to resentence. The issue of the proportion between head sentence and non parole period necessarily arises. Senior counsel for the Crown accepted the observation that there was a non parole period of 76.4 percent proportionate to head sentence, and that for a 51 (now 52) year old male with no prior convictions, such would be at the top of the accepted range. Fairly he pointed out that this Court in R v Rodriguez CCA unreported 11 March 1994, it was said that a non parole period of 75 percent should be reserved for ""worst cases"". In Bernier it was stated that the norm lay between sixty and sixty six and two thirds percent. 
     
      
       
      
    16    I propose the following orders:  
     
      
       
       That the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted; that the appeal be allowed and the sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. In lieu thereof, the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for seven years with a non parole period of four years and six months; such sentence to commence on 6 June 1998. 
       
      
      
     
      
       
       I would direct that counsel for the applicant explain to his client the effect of that sentence in accordance with the requirements of the statute. 
       
      
     17    MEAGHER JA: I agree. 18    HIDDEN J: I agree. 19    MEAGHER JA: The orders of the court are therefore the orders proposed by Grove J.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JThursday, 26 August 199970054/98 - REGINA v Brian John ROBSONJUDGMENT1   HIS HONOUR: On 2 July 1999 the prisoner, Brian John Robson, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter in October 1997 of Ronald Charles Brotherton. He had been charged with murder and the Crown accepted his plea in discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    2   During 1997 the prisoner, his wife and their children lived in a house in Moruya. The deceased was out of a job and addicted to alcohol and illegal drugs. He prevailed upon the prisoner and his wife, Mrs Thirza Robson, to let him live at their house. During the few months that he lived there, the deceased used heroin, and that fact became known to the principal of the school attended by the children and to other local authorities. The question was officially raised whether the children were being properly looked after. At this, the prisoner and Mrs Robson required the deceased to leave the house, and he did so. 
     
      
    3   The prisoner and Mrs Robson were not well off. She was the owner of a car which, though it was not of great value, was important to the family. The prisoner had worked on it from time to time. Not long after he left the household, the deceased returned to the house without permission, stole the keys to the car, took the car and drove it until it left the road and sustained substantial damage. He appears to have been under the influence of alcohol at the time. On the following morning he went to the prisoner and Mrs Robson and told them what he had done. The prisoner told him to leave. Some time later, the deceased visited them again and said that he would pay for the damage. They did not take him seriously because over the months that he had lived with them he had never paid board or repaid their generous hospitality in any way, notwithstanding promises to do so. 
     
      
    4   The prisoner told Mrs Robson that someone should teach the deceased a lesson. 
     
      
    5   The deceased, who had a history of committing criminal offences, went to live with a couple called Martin Strahan and Leanne Holmes. Whilst he lived there, he involved himself in theft and they in turn asked him to leave. By the time of the events that followed, the deceased was living in a house owned or occupied by a man called Terry Shipley in a rural district about ten kilometres from the Robsons’ house. 
     
      
    6   One day, according to the evidence of Mrs Robson, which I find reliable in this respect, she and the prisoner were at their house with Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes. The prisoner and Mr Strahan left in a car and Mrs Robson and Miss Holmes remained at the house. 
     
      
    7   It is common ground that the prisoner found the deceased at Mr Shipley’s house and savagely punched him a number of times. The deceased died. It is not necessary for present purposes to come to any conclusion about what part, if any, was played by Mr Strahan. 
     
      
    8   The prisoner wrapped the body in tarpaulin, put it into the boot of a car, took it to a remote place in the bush and dumped it. The tarpaulin was still with the body when it was found several months later. 
     
      
    9   Soon after he returned home, the prisoner told Mrs Robson that he had punched the deceased and accidentally killed him. As a result of what the prisoner or Mr Strahan told her, she believed that the prisoner and Mr Strahan had been involved in the death and that Miss Holmes’ car had been used to take the body and dump it in bushland. The tarpaulin which she and Miss Holmes had put into the boot of Miss Holmes’ car had been used for the purpose. 
     
      
    10   After the prisoner told her what had happened to the deceased, Mrs Robson must have been in some agony of mind and she kept the matter to herself. Eventually, however, she found herself unable any longer to do so and informed a social worker and was referred to the police. That is how her statement came to be made. 
     
      
    11   The prisoner was arrested and interviewed by the police. I shall refer later on to what he told them. 
     
      
    12   The prisoner gave evidence, and the central part of his account was that he had punched the deceased a number of times, not intending to do him grievous bodily harm. His counsel submits that his act was unlawful and dangerous. The nature of the offence to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty requires an acceptance of that evidence and that submission. I propose to sentence the prisoner accordingly, even though I do not accept his account as complete and truthful in every respect. 
     
      
    13   The prisoner said in evidence before me that during the four or five hours before he went to Mr Shipley’s house he had drunk the contents of a bottle of whisky. I accept that this was so. 
     
      
    14   The prisoner said that he went to the house intending only to try to get money to repair his car and had no intention of assaulting the deceased. I think that the prisoner may well have wanted to take whatever chance he had of collecting money, but I think that he had a good idea that he would be the one to teach the deceased a lesson. I think that he intended to assault the deceased. 
     
      
    15   The resentment of the prisoner about the way the deceased had used him, his wife and family is understandable, but his reaction was entirely unjustified. 
     
      
    16   Dealing with the circumstances of the assault itself, the prisoner told the Court that an argument arose between the two men when the deceased rejected the assertion that the car had been written off. According to the prisoner, the deceased was under the influence of alcohol and behaved aggressively towards him, threatening him and throwing the first punch. I accept that the deceased probably behaved in some such manner. 
     
      
    17   The prisoner told the Court that Mr Strahan telephoned Leanne Holmes and asked her to bring a tarpaulin from the prisoner’s house. That was one of a number of versions which might explain how he came by the tarpaulin. 
     
      
    18   It differs from the statement of facts tendered by consent at the commencement of the evidence. According to that statement, the prisoner telephoned Mrs Robson, who asked Miss Holmes to take a tarpaulin to the property. Miss Holmes did so. 
     
      
    19   The prisoner’s evidence accords with the statement of Mrs Robson, who said that Miss Holmes asked for a tarpaulin, without explaining why. Mrs Robson found one and helped Miss Holmes put it into the boot of her car. 
     
      
    20   The final version comes from what the prisoner told the police, namely that he had obtained his own tarpaulin from Mr Shipley’s house, where he had left it three weeks earlier. 
     
      
    21   I am satisfied that the prisoner deliberately told the police a false story, intending to protect Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes. I think that either the prisoner or Mr Strahan telephoned Miss Holmes from Mr Shipley’s house to ask for the tarpaulin to be brought. I am unable to say which man made the request. 
     
      
    22   The prisoner said in evidence that he and Mr Strahan wrapped the body in the tarpaulin, put it in the boot of Miss Holmes’ car and took it into the bush. That was all Mr Strahan’s idea and it was Mr Strahan who threw the body in the bush. The prisoner stayed in the car. I cannot say whether this was an accurate summary, but I am satisfied that the prisoner played a part in disposing of the body. 
     
      
    23   According to the autopsy report prepared by Dr C Lawrence, the deceased died from blunt force injuries to the head and chest. The injuries to the face comprised a fracture of the hard palate, a linear fracture of the right frontal bone and a separation of the facial and skull bones. Dr Lawrence also noted linear rib fractures in ribs three, four, five and six on the right and in ribs five to eleven inclusive on the left. 
     
      
    24   Commenting upon Dr Lawrence’s opinion, Dr Michael A Zillman, in his report dated 12 May 1999, stated that the portion of the skull which was fractured was the parietal, not the frontal, bone, but I think that nothing turns on that. Dr Zillman thought that a roll-over motor vehicle accident might have caused any or all of the bony injuries and that an accelerated fall after death could have caused the rib fractures. There is no evidence of any accelerated fall after death. I doubt whether the deceased received any of his injuries in the motor vehicle accident, chiefly because he twice went to the house of the prisoner and Mrs Robson, and no mention was made of any difficulty he was then apparently having. So many fractured ribs would have given him obvious pain and lack of mobility. I conclude that all the bony injuries were inflicted by the prisoner at the time the men fought in Mr Shipley’s house. 
     
      
    25   Those injuries were very severe and would ordinarily imply an intention to do grievous bodily harm. However, the prisoner is not to be taken to have had so great an intent. Perhaps the explanation is that, as he told the police, he just “lost it”, and struck harder than he realised under the influence of the alcohol he had drunk. 
     
      
    26   Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes are to be tried in this Court, charged respectively with the murder of the deceased and with being an accessory after the fact of the murder. The prisoner was asked whether he would give evidence for the Crown at their trial, and he said that he would. It is not clear from the facts that have been put before the Court on this plea of guilty precisely how the Crown proposes to make out its case against Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes, but whatever that case may be, I am led to the conclusion that the evidence of the prisoner would be of limited worth. 
     
      
    27   In the account he gave the police the prisoner said that Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes were in the vicinity of Mr Shipley’s house after the death of the deceased and that he, not Miss Holmes, obtained the tarpaulin in which the deceased’s body was wrapped for disposal. He said that he did not know whether Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes saw him carrying the body to the car and that he did it all himself. He told them that he would be back soon, drove the car to the bush and dumped the body off a bush track. Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes were not present when he did so and as far as he knew they had no idea that he had killed the deceased. 
     
      
    28   I am satisfied that this was a false story intended to protect Mr Strahan and Miss Holmes. 
     
      
    29   In evidence before me, the prisoner said that Mr Strahan entered the house after or, perhaps, just before he stopped hitting the deceased. Given his obvious desire to protect Mr Strahan I am left unsure whether he is telling the truth about this matter. 
     
      
    30   I received the impression that before he was cross-examined, the prisoner had never considered whether he would give evidence at the forthcoming trial. He has made no undertaking to do so. I think that any evidence he might give might well be regarded by the jury as unreliable, especially in view of the inconsistent accounts he has given. I shall allow only a very modest reduction of his sentence on this account. 
     
      
    31   The prisoner is now thirty-one years old. He has a moderate criminal history. I will ignore the several offences for which he was dealt with in the Children’s Court and the Local Court earlier than ten years ago. Since 1990 he has committed a number of driving offences, which I will ignore. 
     
      
    32   In 1995 he was dealt with for an assault on a woman in a caravan park. He and another man went to the caravan of a woman at a caravan park at Moruya. The prisoner sprayed the occupant with a mixture of petrol and diesel fuel which he kept in a plastic spray bottle. The mixture wet the woman’s singlet. The other man took the bottle from the prisoner, pointed it again at the woman, produced a cigarette lighter and lit it, then sprayed the contents of the bottle through the flame. The woman’s hair was singed and an ear was slightly burnt. 
     
      
    33   The prisoner was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of four months and his colleague to eight months. It was submitted on his behalf before me that the part he played in the attack was really a joke and that his criminality was not to be seen as incorporating what his colleague did with the lighter. No findings of fact were tendered from the Local Court. 
     
      
    34   In view of the sentence imposed, I cannot accept that submission. The sentencing magistrate must have accepted that the prisoner was substantially responsible for all that happened to the woman, otherwise there would have been a far greater difference between the two sentences. 
     
      
    35   A pre-sentence report was made to this Court by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service, Mr Bajda, and he gave evidence. It was pointed out by Mr Bajda that the prisoner was adopted as an infant and that his childhood development was disrupted at age ten years when his father died. After that he began to display disruptive and uncooperative behaviour. He was often teased by his peers because he was an adopted child. He had difficulty at school and was often absent. He left without qualifications when he was fifteen. He completed a pre-apprenticeship course and subsequently found work in the timber and manufacturing industry. He was live-in caretaker at Moruya Jockey Club for two years. At the date of the report he had been unemployed for three years. Oral evidence was given also of the prisoner’s childhood difficulties and their effect upon him. 
     
      
    36   However, whilst such matters will often weigh heavily in the sentencing of a youth or a young man, they can be given less weight in the determination of the sentence of a thirty-one year old man who has had opportunities to overcome the difficulties he faced as a child and as a teenager. 
     
      
    37   The prisoner pleaded guilty to manslaughter as soon as or soon after the Crown indicated that it was prepared to accept such a plea. He will have credit for that. 
     
      
    38   The prisoner has a minor record for drug offences. More importantly, since the events of October 1997 the prisoner has become addicted to heroin. He has attempted to overcome that addiction and is attending a methadone clinic. There appear to be good prospects that he will rid himself of his addiction. The clinic reported that on 4 August 1999 the prisoner declined to provide a urine sample, but I accept the explanation that he has given. 
     
      
    39   The prisoner and Mrs Robson have a large family. He has three children by a previous relationship. They live with their mother but have been visiting him every second weekend. Mrs Robson has three children by a previous relationship and has custody of two of them. The prisoner and Mrs Robson have two further children of their own, and they live with them. The prisoner’s mother gave evidence, and I accept that her support and the support of Mrs Robson is strong. 
     
      
    40   I am satisfied that the prisoner profoundly regrets what he has done and, notwithstanding my reservations about the accuracy of his evidence, I think that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. 
     
      
    41   I think that the need for the prisoner to rid himself of his heroin addiction and to complete his rehabilitation and bear the responsibilities that he will have towards his family once again upon his release call for the imposition of an additional term which is greater than one-third of the minimum term of the sentence I intend to impose. 
     
      
    42   Although they lacked frequent contact with the deceased because of his movements and because he spent periods of time in prison, his sister and brother, Ms Mariea Whitby and Mr Malcolm Brotherton, loved him. Victim impact statements have been put before the Court which say something of the effect the death of the deceased has had upon them. Of course, the effect of the death of the deceased on his family cannot be taken into account in fixing the sentence to be imposed on the prisoner, but it is appropriate for the Court to extend its sympathy to the family, and it does so. 
     
      
    43   The prisoner is sentenced to penal servitude for a period of five years, comprising a minimum term of three years commencing on 20 August 1999 and expiring on 19 August 2002 and an additional term of two years. The prisoner will be eligible for release on parole on 19 August 2002.

     REGINA v “YZ” 
      
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
      
    2   SULLY J: This is an appeal brought pursuant to section 21E of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions,[“the Director”]. The respondent to the appeal is a prisoner who is known, for the purposes of the present proceedings, by the Court-approved pseudonym, “YZ”. 
    3   On 5 August 1994 YZ was arrested and charged with having conspired to import into Australia prohibited imports, to which section 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) applied, to whit, narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of cannabis resin being not less than the commercial quantity prescribed for cannabis resin. The maximum statutory penalty for such an offence is life imprisonment. 
    4   YZ pleaded guilty to the charge and before a Local Court Magistrate. On 5 March 1996, YZ adhered to that plea before his Honour Justice Blanch, Chief Judge of the District Court. Thereafter, and on 5 and 8 March 1996 Blanch J heard submissions on sentence. Put simply, YZ indicated to Blanch J his willingness to assist the Director by giving evidence for the Crown in a pending prosecution of a man called Warren, an alleged co-conspirator with YZ and others in connection with the cannabis resin importation previously mentioned. YZ signed an undertaking to that effect; and it will be necessary to return presently to a consideration of the terms of the undertaking and of the way in which it was subsequently implemented. On 11 March 1996 Blanch J sentenced YZ to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 6-1/2 years. His Honour indicated that he had reduced the head sentence from 10 years 4 months and the non-parole period from 7-1/2 years, in consideration of YZ’s undertaking to give future assistance to the Director in connection with the prosecution of Warren. 
    5   The trial of Warren commenced on 21 April 1997. On 17 April 1997, and in circumstances to which it will be necessary to refer later herein, YZ was called in connection with a pre-trial voir dire. The purpose of the voir dire was, put shortly, to establish: first, whether YZ would give evidence at all in fulfilment of his undertaking in that behalf; and secondly, if so, what evidence he would give. At the voir dire hearing, YZ made it clear that he was not prepared to give any evidence against Warren at the latter’s trial. On 28 May 1997, and in the wake of that refusal, the Director instituted the present section 21E appeal.  
    6   The Director seeks, by way of the appeal, to have the sentence actually imposed by Blanch J increased to the level of the sentence that his Honour indicated he would have imposed had it not been for YZ’s undertaking to give future assistance in the prosecution of Warren. The terms of section 21E(3)(a) require imperatively that the Court, “if it is satisfied that ……… [YZ] …….has failed entirely to cooperate in accordance with the undertaking”, must reinstate the head sentence of 10 years 4 months and the accompanying non-parole period of 7-1/2 years, which Blanch J himself would have imposed but for YZ’s undertaking to give future assistance.  
    7   The Crown case is simple. It is: first, that YZ, at the time when he gave the undertaking to Blanch J, was not acting in good faith; and secondly that YZ has failed, in fact, entirely to cooperate in accordance with his undertaking; and has so failed “without reasonable excuse”. The phrase “without reasonable excuse” appears in section 21E(2)(c). Section 21E(2)(c) entails, so far as is now relevant, that the Director, before instituting an appeal of the present kind, must consider, among other prescribed things, whether the relevant failure to comply with an undertaking to give assistance to law enforcement agencies occurred, in fact, “without reasonable excuse”. 
    8   In an interlocutory judgment handed down on 23 March 1999 this Court held that the Court itself, when called upon to exercise its powers under section 21E(3), must consider for itself whether, if in fact there had been an entire failure to cooperate with the relevant undertaking, such failure could properly be characterised as having been “without reasonable excuse”. 
    9   For YZ it was submitted strenuously that, although he had indeed failed entirely to give evidence in accordance with his relevant undertaking, there had been, at the time of such failure, “reasonable excuse” for the failure. 
    10   The gravamen of YZ’s case in connection with the present appeal can be summarised as follows: 
     
      
     (1) He gave the undertaking in all good faith; but 
      
      
     (2) He believed, when he gave the undertaking, that in consideration of his giving the projected evidence against Warren, he would be given such reasonable protection, and assistance otherwise, as would reasonably assure his physical safety and that of his immediate family;  
      
      
     (3) That by the time he was called on 17 April 1997, and in the context of the pre-trial  
     voir dire 
      earlier herein mentioned, there had been widespread publicity, both within, and outside, his place of confinement, of the fact that he was proposing to give evidence as a Crown witness in the trial of Warren; and that there had been, in the aftermath of such publicity, threats, which he took very seriously indeed, of physical harm to him and to his immediate family. 
      
      
     (4) Further, and in exacerbation of the matters referred to in (3) above, it was ruled by the presiding Judge that the pre-trial  
     voir dire 
      hearing should be conducted in open Court; and that he, YZ, would be cross-examined in open Court by Senior Counsel briefed to appear for Warren at the latter’s trial. This particular Senior Counsel held, also, a brief to appear for a very notorious criminal about whom YZ had given to the police, at some earlier time, information that inculpated that criminal in certain extremely serious criminal offences. YZ apprehended that, if so cross-examined by that particular Senior Counsel, he would be cross-examined, and in open Court, about his having given to the police that particular inculpatory information. 
      
      
     (5) The cumulative effect of the foregoing matters was that when he was called at the  
     voir dire 
      hearing, he was terrified, with every good reason, of the harmful consequences that, as he judged the situation, would certainly result from his then giving evidence in accordance with his undertaking. 
      
    11   In considering these two competing cases in connection with the present appeal, it is convenient to take as a starting point the terms of the undertaking given by YZ to Blanch J. The undertaking took the form of a written document in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “I, ….[YZ]…., undertake; 
       
      
      
       
       (1)(a) to give evidence for the Crown in any proceedings against the person nominated below arising from his involvement in the importation of cannabis resin into Australia on 4 August 1994: 
       
      
      
       
        Patrick William WARREN 
       
      
      
       
        (b) that in giving evidence I shall fully and frankly detail my involvement and that of Patrick William WARREN concerned in the importation of cannabis resin described in (a) the subject of any proceedings brought by the Crown of which I have knowledge. 
       
      
      
       
       The evidence I am prepared to give will implicate Warren as one of the principals in the said importation. [ * ] 
       
      
      
       
       I acknowledge that my counsel has fully explained to me the effect of section 21E of the Crimes Act 1914. I acknowledge that I fully understand its effect and the consequences of any failure by me to honour this undertaking. 
       
      
      
       
       Signed ….[YZ]…. 
        
       5 March 1996” 
       
      
    12   Between 11 March 1996, when YZ was sentenced by Blanch J, and 17 April 1997 when YZ was called on the pre-trial voir dire hearing, the Director made repeated attempts to obtain from YZ the usual form of statement of the evidence which YZ, if called to give evidence at the trial of Warren, would be able and willing in fact to give. YZ rebuffed all such approaches by the Director. He would not attend a conference with counsel. He would not give a statement of his own composition. The result was, of course, that the Crown could not provide to Warren’s solicitors, and in advance of the commencement of Warren’s trial, the appropriate advance notification, not only of the intention of the Crown to call YZ at the trial of Warren, but also the nature and extent of the evidence which it was expected that, when so called, YZ would in fact give. The Crown sought to deal with the situation by sending to YZ’s solicitors a copy of the undertaking given by YZ to Blanch J; and by applying to the Judge who was to preside at the trial of Warren, for a voir dire hearing in order to establish clearly what YZ, if called at that trial, would be able and willing to give in evidence. 
    13   I have read the relevant portions of the transcript of the proceedings before Blanch J. It is not easy to make sense of them for present purposes. The proceedings were conducted, of course, in open Court. That entailed that the placing before Blanch J of various documents involved the use of sealed envelopes, accompanied by cryptic comments about the contents of the same. It is, however, fair in my opinion to accept at least the following propositions: 
     
      
     (1) YZ did not at any time dissemble about his stance with regard to giving the relevant undertaking. He did not, for example, offer to give future assistance in connection with more than one of his alleged co-conspirators, (and there was a large number of them), and then provide assistance as to some one in particular of that number of alleged co-conspirators. At all times, YZ gave an assurance, and ultimately the written undertaking to which I have referred, that he would give evidence only against Warren. 
      
      
     (2) The Crown Prosecutor was alive to the limited nature of the assistance being offered by YZ. It was, indeed, in contemplation of the Crown Prosecutor’s perception of those limitations that it was insisted by the Crown that there be included in the written undertaking the short paragraph marked  
     ….[…*…]…. 
     in the reference made earlier herein to the terms of the  
     undertaking as finally given. 
      
     (3) The Crown could have refused to deal with YZ upon the basis of the only undertaking as to future assistance that YZ was prepared to give. The Crown could not, I think, have prevented YZ from informing Blanch J that he was prepared to give assistance in accordance with the undertaking; but I do not see why the Crown could not have told Blanch J that the Crown regarded the proffered assistance as either worthless, (if that were the Crown perception), or of such marginal worth as would not dispose the Crown to call YZ in the trial of Warren, (if that were the Crown perception). It seems to me, however, that the Crown’s position was that YZ’s evidence was not worthless in connection with the pending trial of Warren; and that, albeit the Crown would have preferred a much greater degree of assistance from YZ, the Crown was prepared, nevertheless, to accept, however grudgingly, what was in fact offered by YZ, and to call him, accordingly, at the Warren trial. 
      
    14   For the Crown it was submitted that YZ, at the time he gave the particular undertaking, was in a position to give assistance to the relevant law enforcement agencies as to many more of the alleged co-conspirators than only Warren. It was submitted that YZ was well aware, at the time at which he gave his undertaking, that Warren was in fact senior in years and in ill-health; and that YZ undertook to give evidence against Warren at the latter’s trial because, or predominantly because, YZ’s true belief at the time was that Warren would never be brought to trial because of his age and ill health, with the result that YZ himself would never be called upon to honour in fact his undertaking to give evidence against Warren. 
    15   That level of scepticism about YZ is, in my opinion, wholly understandable. I do not think, however, that there is to hand precise and credible evidence which, if accepted, would justify a positive finding that such scepticism has been vindicated. Nor do I think that such scepticism is of itself sufficient to cut down any of the propositions (1)-(3) previously mentioned. 
    16   It then becomes necessary to consider whether cause has been shown for a finding that YZ, when he resiled from his undertaking, acted “without reasonable excuse”.  
    17   My first impressions, at the hearing of the appeal, were that there was more than a little force in the essential argument put forward by YZ: that is to say, the argument that, by the time he was called to give evidence on 17 April 1997, he had been put in such a position that he faced a stark choice between two evils, of which the lesser was, in his then reasonable perception, to resile from his undertaking. 
    18   In that connection, it should be acknowledged, in my opinion, that by 17 April 1997 things had happened that might have been thought, very reasonably, by YZ to be threatening as to either his own safety or that of his immediate family. By 17 April 1997 YZ was aware that a copy of his undertaking had come into the possession of Warren, and had been circulated by, or at the instigation of, Warren, widely throughout the criminal milieu to which YZ himself was connected. There had been some very strident media publicity which had conveyed, some of it in the most lurid terms, and to the world at large, that YZ had become a police informer. Some graffiti, having obviously nasty overtones, had been sprayed onto various parts of YZ’s then home. YZ himself had been assaulted in prison as a police informer. 
    19   As I have said, such considerations originally disposed me to think that there might be, indeed, substance in YZ’s present contention that his resiling from his undertaking had not been done “without reasonable excuse”. Upon further reflection I have come, however, to the conclusion that a positive finding to that effect should not be made. My reasons are, broadly speaking, the following: 
     
      
     (1) The importation in connection with which YZ was charged was a major operation. It involved three connected syndicates of people. The people concerned in the operation, certainly at the level within it of YZ himself, were engaging actively in a criminal enterprise of major proportions. I have no doubt that YZ himself was well aware of that fact; and that he was sufficiently a man of the world to understand that the kinds of people with whom he was dealing in that context were unsavoury and potentially dangerous. 
      
      
     (2) YZ appears to have had at all material times experienced professional legal representation and advice. He had, certainly, such representation and advice in connection with his appearances in Court before Blanch J, and in connection with his giving, in the context of those proceedings, the undertaking here in question.  
      
      
     (3) It must have been apparent to YZ, when he gave his undertaking, that all the protection in the world could not prevent his having to come face to face in Court with Warren on whatever occasion he, YZ, gave evidence against Warren and in accordance with his undertaking. I do not accept it as reasonable to suppose that YZ, given the level of his professional representation at the material times, did not understand that nobody could give him a guarantee that, when he came to give substantive evidence against Warren at the latter’s trial, he would be allowed to do it in closed Court and hermetically sealed off from any risk of any publicity concerning his evidence. I do not accept it as reasonable to suppose that YZ, advised as he was, can have imagined that there was anything other than a very real likelihood that he would be required to give any substantive evidence against Warren in open Court and in accordance with the normal requirements of the law in that behalf. 
      
      
     (4) It seems to me that, given the foregoing propositions, certain further propositions necessarily flow. There was never any real prospect that YZ, if he gave evidence in accordance with his undertaking, would not be cross-examined. I would not think it a reasonable possibility that YZ was under any illusion that, when so cross-examined, he would be tested to the hilt upon his credit; and that it was entirely likely that, in that connection, he would be cross-examined so as to suggest to the jury at trial that he was an established police informer for his own selfish advantage, and as such was both dishonourable and unreliable. 
      
      
     (5) In sum, there does not seem to me to have been any prospect that YZ could give evidence against Warren at the latter’s trial without Warren being present while he did so. That at once entailed, as it seems to me, not only that Warren himself would know that YZ had informed against him in connection with the importation at the centre of Warren’s trial, but also that Warren would see to it, in the very nature of things, that the fact was made known throughout the criminal milieu of which both of them were a part; and both within and outside the prison system. If it be accepted that YZ acted in good faith when he gave the undertaking to give evidence against Warren, then it must follow, in my view, that YZ gave that undertaking with his eyes open to, at the very least, the realities of which I have latterly spoken. 
      
      
      The events which in fact happened, deplorable though they were, really brought forward sooner rather than later results that were going to occur sooner or later in any event.  
      
    20   For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that the Director has established beyond reasonable doubt that YZ has failed entirely to honour his undertaking to give evidence; and that such failure is “without reasonable excuse”. It must follow that, in my opinion, the appeal should be allowed; and that there should be substituted in accordance with section 21E(3) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, and in place of the sentence imposed by Blanch J, a sentence of 10 years and 4 months commencing on 5 August 1994, and having a non-parole period of 7-1/2 years.

        REGINA v Ian Ormond COX 
         
         
        JUDGMENT 
        
        
       
      
    1    LEVINE J: I will ask Sperling J to deliver the first judgment.2    SPERLING J: This is an application for leave to appeal from the determination of Ainslie-Wallace DCJ refusing to grant a permanent stay of proceedings pursuant to the decision in Dietrich (1992-93) 177 CLR 292 or, alternatively, an adjournment of the proceedings for longer than was in fact granted. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The applicant was to go to trial with others on 1 March 1999. The proceedings were adjourned to 8 March 1999 pending an appeal against a refusal of legal aid. On 9 March 1999, that appeal having failed, her Honour refused an application for a permanent stay but adjourned the proceedings for a period of one week to enable the applicant to apply for leave to appeal from her decision. No application for leave to appeal was filed at that stage. 4    On 22 March 1999, her Honour again refused an application for a permanent stay but adjourned the proceedings as against the applicant for at least three months to enable the applicant to receive necessary documents and to prepare his defence. The trial proceeded against the co-accused. The applicant's trial is now listed for 27 September 1999. 5    Application for leave to appeal was filed, as I understand it from the court papers, on 29 April 1999. The time for such an application is fourteen days. It appears, accordingly, that the application is out of time, but I put that point to one side. 6    The burden of the applicant's complaint on appeal, as it was before her Honour, would be that he is indigent, that he is without representation through no fault of his own, and that the proceedings ought accordingly to have been permanently stayed or a sufficiently long adjournment granted - eighteen to twenty-four months has been sought - to enable the applicant to acquire funds by gainful employment to finance his legal representation, assuming he were able to procure and comply with an order for release on conditional bail. 7    In her judgment given on 9 March 1999, her Honour said that she was not satisfied that the applicant was in fact indigent. Refusal of a permanent stay and of an adjournment predicated upon indigence was the necessary result of that finding.8    The appellant bore the onus of establishing that he was indigent as a necessary condition for entitlement to the relief which he sought: Canellis (1994) 181 CLR 309 at 328. There was evidence before the court which strongly suggested that the applicant's evidence concerning his financial affairs was not truthful. Her Honour did not accept the applicant's evidence that he was indigent. There was no objective evidence which required her Honour to find otherwise. A passage from Carter, (CCA (NSW), 5 September 1995, unreported), applies with equal force to this case and embodies the approach which this court should take. 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""It is difficult to argue that a judge is in error when he says that he has not been satisfied by an onus carrying party that his evidence is true. In the present case, the judge said that he did not accept the appellant's evidence that he did not have access to funds other than the assets and income to which he referred in his evidence. There was plenty of material before the judge which cast doubt upon the truthfulness of the appellant's evidence."" 
         
        
       
      
    9    The absence of satisfaction that the applicant was in fact indigent was also the basis of her Honour's determination of 22 March 1999. The state of the relevant evidence was no different at that time. 
     
      
       
      
    10    An appeal under s 5F is not a re-hearing: BWM (1996-97) 91 A Crim R 260. If leave to appeal is granted in such a case as this, the appeal is against a discretionary decision with the limitations that that implies. 
     
      
       
      
    11    But, before one comes to the merits of any appeal there is the question of leave. Leave will be granted only where the decision is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant the matter being argued on appeal: Steffan (1992-93) 30 NSWLR 633 at 644-5, or where the interests of justice otherwise require the intervention of the court: Matovski (1988-89) 15 NSWLR 720 at 723. 
     
      
       
      
    12    In Carter the Court of Criminal Appeal gave consideration de novo to the question of adjournment, as distinct from the question of a permanent stay. In the present case, however, the alternative of adjournment was a live issue before her Honour as an alternative to a permanent stay. The request for an adjournment is now put on a different basis from that on which the adjournment was granted; namely, for time to earn sufficient money to pay for legal representation rather than for time to prepare. The present ground is, however, predicated on the appellant not having sufficient funds to pay for legal representation, the very matter of which her Honour was not satisfied and which resulted in the application for a permanent stay being refused. In these circumstances, the interests of justice do not require that this Court should grant leave to appeal with a view to obtaining a longer adjournment. 
     
      
       
      
    13    For these reasons, the determination in this case is not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave to appeal, nor do the interests of justice require the intervention of this court for any other reason that has been established.14    I propose that the application for leave to appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    15    LEVINE J: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    16    McINERNEY AJ: I agree.17    LEVINE J: The orders will be as Sperling J has proposed.

      REGINA v RONALD WATSON 
      
      
    1    LEVINE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him in the Sydney District Court by his Honour Judge Gibson Q.C. on 18 September 1998. 
    2    The applicant pleaded guilty to 11 counts of indecently assaulting a female under the age of 16 years pursuant to the then applicable section of the Crimes Act, namely s 76. The maximum sentence under that section was penal servitude for 5 years until the Crimes Act was amended (Act No. 50 of 1974) which thereafter provided a maximum penalty of 6 years in respect of offences after 2 August 1974.  
    3    There were 5 counts in the indictment relating to KP (the applicant’s step-daughter) and to events which occurred in 1976 and 1977 when she was aged approximately 13 years. In relation to the first count (involving the touching of the complainant’s breasts through her clothes), the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years to commence on 8 September 1998. 
    4    In relation to count 2 (digital penetration), the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 8 September 1998. 
    5    In relation to count 3 (the applicant rubbed himself against her and ejaculated), a concurrent 12 months fixed term was imposed.  
    6    In relation to count 4 (vaginal touching and placing her hand on an erect penis), the sentence was the same, namely a concurrent fixed term of 12 months. 
    7    In relation to count 6 (count 5 was abandoned), the conduct involved digital penetration and a concurrent 12 month fixed term sentence was imposed. 
    8    There were four counts in the indictment relating to SF (the applicant’s natural daughter) and conduct which occurred between May 1964 and July 1967 at which time the complainant was aged between 9 and 11 years. 
    9    Count 7 involved the applicant thrusting his penis against her buttocks whilst clothed, conduct said frequently to have occurred over the next twelve months. In respect of this count the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years to commence on 8 September 2000, that is cumulative to the fixed term of 2 years imposed in respect of the first count relating to KP. 
    10    Count 8 involving SF involved the applicant touching the outside of the complainant’s vagina. In respect of this count the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 12 months to commence on 8 September 1998. 
    11    Count 9 involved digital penetration and the sentence imposed was a concurrent fixed term of 12 months. 
    12    The tenth count involved the applicant placing the complainant’s hand on his erect penis and masturbating him. For this offence a concurrent fixed term of 12 months was imposed. 
    13    There were two counts relating to SP (the applicant’s natural daughter) in relation to events occurring between December 1969 and January 1970. The complainant was aged 11.  
    14    The eleventh count involving SP was concerned with the applicant’s rubbing her right nipple. In relation to this eleventh count the applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of two years commencing on 8 September 2002 and expiring on 7 September 2004 and an additional term commencing on 8 September 2004. This, it will be seen, was further cumulative to the fixed terms of 2 years imposed in respect of count 1 (KP) and count 7, imposed in respect to SF. 
    15    Count 12 involving CP was concerned with the rubbing of her breast and in respect of this offence the sentence imposed was a concurrent fixed term of 12 months commencing on 8 September 1998. 
    16    It thus can be seen that in relation to the first count involving the first and second complainants (counts 1 and 7) his Honour imposed cumulative 2 year fixed terms and in relation to the first count involving the third complainant (count 11) a cumulative sentence of 4 years made up of a minimum term of 2 years and an additional term of 2 years. In relation to all other counts in respect to each complainant his Honour imposed a fixed term of 12 months to date from 8 September 1998. 
    17    The effective head sentence was 6 years with an additional term of 2 years. 
    18    The applicant, born on 16 August 1933, pleaded guilty on 8 September 1998. There was evidence before his Honour pointing to their having been some disclosure to the applicant’s then wife in 1972 in relation to the charges involving SF and SP and in about 1972 in relation to KP. The applicant at the time of his arrest was living as a single man on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. He had retired in 1988 after lengthy employment with John Fairfax & Sons Pty Limited, had held a responsible position and was otherwise a man of good character, he having no prior convictions. Evidence was called from the applicant that the realisation of what he had done began in the early 1990s at the time of the breakdown of his second marriage. His Honour found that as a result of being charged the applicant had certainly attempted to rehabilitate himself, but accepted that the applicant still had a long way to go to understand the effect his conduct has had on his daughters and step-daughter. 
    19    In his Remarks on Sentence his Honour took into account that the applicant had admitted his guilt and had shown remorse for his conduct. His Honour also took into account the Pre-Sentence Report prepared by the Queensland Corrections in which at paragraph 2.06 the following appears: 
     
      
       
       “Mr Watson does acknowledge and accept the nature and extent of the offending behaviour. There appears to have been a planned and calculated pattern to the offending behaviour over many years. Mr Watson acknowledges the behaviour offered him convenient sexual gratification. The counsellor, Mr Brinnand and Mr Watson indicate that the offences were the result of a misguided sense of love, to show them that he “loved them”. In direct contrast the two victims spoken to view the offending behaviour as acts motivated by his desire for power, ownership and control of them.  
       [SF]  
       described his eyes and look prior to the commission of offences as an eerie, scary look not one of love. The actual feelings experienced by her were of hate and fear not love”. 
       
      
    20    And in paragraph 9.01 under the heading “Recommendation” there appears: 
     
      
       
       “While it appears Watson has made every effort following his arrest to address his offending behaviour there remains to the writer some areas of concern. The offending behaviour was of a calculated nature over a considerable time-frame affecting the lives of victims and immediate family. Watson is considered a risk offender and needs to be monitored to ensure he avoids “at risk” situations”. 
       
      
    21    Similarly his Honour had regard to the report of the psychiatrist, Dr Hutchinson of 11 June 1998 who described the applicant in terms of being a depressed and penitent, ashamed man and indeed, a very frightened man. Dr Hutchinson went on to say: “predicting the future is difficult. Pedophiliacs are well known for their re-offending but I felt he was suitably penitent and this Court case has given him stress which I think he is unlikely to risk again. I think his chances of re-offending are small”. 
    22    There was also before his Honour a report from John Brinnand, Social Worker who remarked that the “greatest risk of Mr Watson re-offending is the improper management of his shame and his need to offend, be punished and ultimately be forgiven. Through disclosures of his offending history to selected persons, Mr Watson has begun to forge positive self-image based on an open, self-directed confrontation of his shame and his secrets”. 
    23    As to the objective seriousness of the offences his Honour’s views were made quite clear. He regarded the conduct as most serious. 
     
      
       
       “If there is one male a young girl is entitled to trust in a sexual sense as she grows into maturity it is the man who is her father or stepfather. You, Mr Watson betrayed that trust and as each of these then young girls approached their teens and were at their most vulnerable you used and abused them in a shameful way. They will continue to bear the scars of your conduct over the years and I doubt, on the evidence, that you fully understand the burden you placed on them. 
       
      
      
       
       To those others in society who might think of behaving in the way that you did, let it be clearly understood that by doing so when caught they face, as you do, strong custodial sentences”. 
       
      
    24    His Honour made these remarks having dealt with submissions that there should be some degree of mitigation because of the delay in the matter coming to light and came to the view that the prisoner was not entitled to profit from that fact. The prisoner could not gain because he was prepared to pretend that nothing had happened to his children. His Honour then said “I can see no reason for finding special circumstances other than the way I propose to structure the sentence and I find them for that reason. I take into consideration the fact that he will be serving his sentence in segregation”. 
    25    Before he imposed the sentences as structured above, his Honour said: “I do not think that the maximum provided for the individual offences is sufficient to encompass the criminality of the totality of these offences and I propose to structure the sentence to encompass all complainants by way of accumulation”. 
    26    It is submitted for the applicant that the first basis that would enliven the discretion of this Court to interfere is that his Honour, whilst having regard to the maximum sentence available under s 76 as it then applied, did not have regard to the range of sentences imposed at the relevant time during the operation of that section. That it was appropriate and proper for him to have done so is clear: Regina v Shore (1992) 66 A Crim R 37 at 42 per Badgery-Parker J. It was submitted in writing and orally that the maximum penalties for offences with which his Honour was dealing have increased markedly and that moreover, judicial attitudes have strengthened in the sense that more severe sentences are being imposed than was the case in 1970 to 1977. By reference to recently generated statistics, counts 2, 6 and 9 after 1981 would have been charged as offences under s 61D (repealed in 1989) as sexual intercourse by a person in authority with a maximum penalty of 12 years. The applicable section after 1989 was s 66C(2) which fixed a maximum penalty of 10 years. 
    27    Specific cases are difficult to come by but Mr Heazlewood of Counsel for the applicant was good enough to provide the Court with an extract from “Sentencing Violent Offenders in New South Wales” by Ivan Potas (1980). This publication (clearly not available to the learned sentencing judge) does provide information that is indicative, subject to all the usual variables, of a lower range of sentence being imposed decades ago (as to use of statistical material see: Regina v Visconti (1982) 2 NSWLR 104 and R v Bloomfield (1997-1998) 44 NSWLR 734). 
    28    The second basis, it is contended, which warrants interference is the decision of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 156 ALR 684 and the statement of approach, if I may put it that way, set out in the judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ at paragraph 45:  
     
      
       
       “To an offender, the only relevant question may be ‘how long’, and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality”. 
       
      
    29    What is here submitted is that in light of that statement by their Honours it can now be seen that the structuring by the sentencing judge of his sentence was flawed insofar as it is apparent that an “appropriate sentence for each offence” was not fixed but rather the first count relevant to each separate complainant was used as the vehicle for the imposition of the higher sentence (the 2 year fixed term) even if the facts founding each of those relevant counts was not as serious as the facts founding the counts in respect of which the fixed term of 12 months was imposed. 
     
      
     as the facts founding the counts in respect of which the fixed term of 12 months was imposed. 
      
    30    These two considerations plus what is contended to be the lack of weight attached to various subjective matters lead to an ultimate sentence by cumulation outside of any appropriate range applicable and, taking into account the sentencing regime that would have operated at the relevant time reflects an overall sentence of at least 10 to 11 years (that is, taking into account remissions and the like). 
    31    I am persuaded of the correctness of the submissions in relation to the two substantive matters referred to above. 
    32    The effect of his Honour’s approach exposed by his views as to the inadequacy of the then statutory maximum and accumulating the sentences was artificially to increase the maximum penalty. The sentences were intentionally high or more pertinently, the ultimate sentence was intentionally high. Whilst one might expect sentences of that order at the present time for offences involving penetration bearing in mind the increased statutory maxima and the hardening of judicial attitudes generally a total sentence of eight years was excessive by the relevant standards being those of 1966 - 1977 when the offences were committed. In imposing penalties a judge should not act on his personal view that the maximum penalty prescribed is inadequate. Where there are a number of, or multiple offences, a judge must consider the appropriate sentence for each offence and decide whether the sentences should be cumulative or concurrent or partly so. If there are a large number of offences spread over a period and different degrees of criminality he may decide that to meet the total criminality and punish it appropriately some sentences should be concurrent and some should be cumulative or partly so.  
    33    I do not accept that there was no justification for accumulating the sentences. There were several bases on which it was correct to do so. These included that some of the instances of indecent assault were more serious than others, for example, digital penetration of the vagina and having one daughter hold and masturbate his penis on the one hand and touching and sucking parts of the body on the other. The offences took place in different time periods and with different victims. The sentences had to be correct both as to the individual offences and as a whole reflecting the totality of the criminality. One difficulty in the present case is the judge’s choice of the first count in each group of charges in respect of each victim as the one on which to impose the major sentence of cumulative minimum terms of 2 years. Those counts (being counts 1, 7 and 11) were not the more serious charges and the sentences imposed on them were not justified by the standards prevailing at the time of the offences. This point applies with almost overwhelming force, to count 11. The offence involved the applicant sucking the right nipple and yet he received a minimum term of 2 years and an additional term of 2 years. Further, the ultimate effect of the course taken by the judge was to arrive at a total period which was excessive. 
    34    I turn to deal with the complaint that the judge did not adequately deal with the issue of special circumstances. The judge was correct in identifying as special circumstances that he was cumulating sentences (Regina v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58 and that the applicant would be serving his sentence in segregation. Hence, he imposed the sentence of 4 years on the eleventh count with a minimum term of 2 years. When an overall view of the sentences is taken the judge has allowed for the cumulation of the sentences by adjusting the sentence on the last count as he did. He seems to have allowed nothing for the period to be served in segregation. 
    35    Other special circumstances existed. These included the age of the applicant, that this was his first time in prison and the need for rehabilitation and supervision. The judge gave no reasons why he made no allowance for these and the sentence being served in segregation and protective custody. Reasons could reasonably have been expected: R. v Bo Too (CCA, unreported 16 July 1992). They were in combination, important special circumstances for which some allowance should have been made. 
    36    The question of delay is a difficult one. Normally where either the complainant or the authorities delay, that is a relevant matter. The complainants became 18 some years ago. The delays range from about 20 to 30 years. However, the applicant will receive the benefit of being sentenced in accordance with the less severe sentences imposed during the period from 1966 to 1977. As to delay the judge focussed on the wrong point. It is not a question of the applicant profiting because he was prepared to pretend that nothing happened to the children. The point is that there was extensive delay because the complainants refrained for so long from reporting the matter and they have been adults for many years. Nevertheless, this is not a case where there should be any substantial allowance for the delay. 
    37    The case for this Court to intervene and re-sentence has been established. Indeed, the Crown accepted that this Court was bound to re-sentence in view of the first and second challenges. However, the Crown contended that in re-sentencing this Court should reach much the same overall result as the judge. 
    38    There has been no Crown appeal against the inadequacy of any of the fixed term sentences of 12 months in relation to the counts involving more serious offences (digital penetration and being required to handle the applicant’s penis). Thus these sentences cannot be increased. 
    39    The fixed term sentences of 12 months on each of the three counts of digital penetration should stand. They are lenient sentences. As those serious offences took place in different periods, namely, count 9 between June 1966 and June 1967, count 6 between April 1975 and July 1976, and count 2 between August and December 1976 those sentences should be cumulative. The fixed term sentence of 12 months on count 10 (being required to handle the applicant’s penis) should be reduced to a fixed term of 6 months and be cumulative. 
    40    The principle of totality is relevant to all offences but its practical application is apparent in the sentences on the remaining counts. As to counts 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 12 a sentence of a fixed term of 6 months should be imposed. These sentences should be concurrent with each other but cumulative upon the earlier sentences. 
    41    The sentence on count 11 cannot stand. Instead there should be a sentence of 2 years comprising a minimum term of 6 months and an additional term of 18 months to be served as to the minimum term concurrently with the sentences mentioned in the immediately preceding paragraph. 
    42    The reason for not fixing additional terms in relation to all but one sentence is the cumulation of the minimum terms. In relation to those counts where the length of the sentence remains unaltered it is necessary to adjust the dates. The additional term of 18 months is appropriate to cover the cumulation and all the other special circumstances, most of which are mentioned earlier. 
    43    I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
       (a) Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
        
       (b) Appeals against sentenced allowed. 
        
       (c) In lieu of the sentences imposed by Judge Gibson the following sentences are imposed: 
       
      
      
       
       (i) As to count 2 (digital penetration) a fixed term of 12 months starting on 8 September 1998 and ending on 7 September 1999. 
       
      
      
       
       (ii) As to count 6 (digital penetration) a fixed term of 12 months starting on 8 September 1999 and ending on 7 September 2000. 
       
      
      
       
       (iii) As to count 9 (digital penetration) a fixed term of 12 months starting on 8 September 2000 and ending on 7 September 2001. 
       
      
      
       
       (iv) As to count 10 (required to handle penis) a fixed term of 6 months starting on 8 September 2001 and ending on 7 March 2002. 
       
      
      
       
       (v) As to counts 1, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 12 a fixed term of 6 months on each count to be served concurrently starting on 8 March 2002 and ending on 7 September 2002. 
       
      
      
       
       (vi) As to count 11 a minimum term of 6 months starting on 8 March 2002 and ending on 7 September 2002 and an additional term of 18 months starting on 8 September 2002. 
       
      
      
       
       (vii) The applicant will be eligible for release to parole on 7 September 2002 subject to supervision and such other conditions the Parole Board may impose.

       JUDGMENT 
        
        
       
      
     1 SMART AJ 
     : Peter Joseph Paul Corneilissen applies for an extension of time in which to appeal against his conviction of supplying a traffickable quantity of prohibited drugs, namely amphetamines, in November 1991. Judge Mahoney sentenced him, on 18 February 1993, to a minimum term of nine months and an additional term of thirteen months. 
      
     2 Three detectives went to the premises of the appellant at Forbes taking a quantity of amphetamines with them. The detectives “ 
     loaded up 
     ” the appellant with such amphetamines. They weighed up the amphetamines in front of the appellant and then charged him with the offence mentioned. They supported that charge by giving false evidence. This was wicked conduct and a serious abuse of power. 
      
     3 During the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service the detectives involved admitted the foregoing conduct. 
      
     4 The Crown accepts that its case rested entirely upon police evidence which was subsequently admitted to be fabricated by the police. Accordingly, the Crown concedes, and correctly so, that the appeal should be upheld and a verdict of acquittal entered. 
      
     5 The following orders should be made:  
      
      1. Extend time until today in which the applicant may appeal. 
      
      2. Appeal allowed, conviction quashed. 
      
      3. Verdict of acquittal entered. 
      
     6 DUNFORD J: I agree.

     JUDGMENT 
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: I invite Mr Justice Sperling to give judgment in this matter. 
     
      
       
      
    2    SPERLING J: On 21 July 1994, the applicant was charged with offences which included being knowingly concerned in the commission of an offence against the law of the Commonwealth: Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 29B. The charges related to the applicant's complicity in an attempted fraud on the Australian Tax Office. He was then acting as solicitor for Mr Leonard McPherson and Mr McPherson's wife. He was granted bail. I will refer to this as matter 1. 3    On 24 October 1996, the applicant was charged with offences relating to allegedly false evidence given on 11 July 1996 in an application to vary his bail conditions. He was also charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice in dealings with a journalist, Mr Perkins, in relation to Mr McPherson's pending trial. Bail was refused by the Local Court but granted by the Supreme Court on 31 October 1996. I will refer to these charges as matters 2 and 3. 4    On 14 July 1997, the applicant was charged with a state and a Commonwealth offence relating to an attempt to obtain a false passport with a view to absconding. Bail was refused. I will refer to these charges as matters 4 and 5. 5    On 1 August 1997, bail was revoked in relation to matters 1 and 3. No doubt, bail was refused in matters 4 and 5 and revoked in matters 1 and 3 because the applicant had demonstrated he could not be trusted to attend at his trial for those offences. 6    On 9 September 1997 the applicant was convicted in matter 3 and remanded in custody for sentence. On 20 October 1997, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment commencing on 14 July 1997, that being the date on which he was taken into custody on matters 4 and 5. 7    On 1 June 1998, while in custody serving that sentence, the applicant pleaded guilty in matter 1 and requested that the offences in matters 4 and 5 be taken into account. 8    On 17 July 1998, the conviction in matter 3 was quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal and a new trial was ordered. 9    The applicant was now in custody in relation to matter 1, bail revoked, and matters 4 and 5, bail refused. On 2 October 1998, he applied for bail in relation to those matters. Bail was refused. 10    On 20 November 1998, the applicant was convicted in matter 2. On 26 November 1998, he was sentenced by Hidden J to a term of imprisonment of fourteen months, to be released on a recognisance after eight months expiring on 15 July 1999. In fixing the commencement date of that sentence his Honour gave the applicant credit for the applicant's period in custody from the first day of that trial, 16 November 1998. 11    On 17 December 1998, Davidson DCJ sentenced the applicant in matters 1, 4 and 5. He fixed a sentence of twelve months commencing on 15 July 1999 when the applicant was due to be released under Hidden J’s sentence, the applicant to be released on a recognisance after eight months expiring on 14 January 2000. 12    In so doing Davidson DCJ, by agreement, took into account 220 days in prior custody. That was the time in custody from 24 October 1996, when the applicant was charged in matters 2 and 3, and 16 November 1998, the commencement date of Hidden J's sentence, less the period from 20 October 1997 to 17 July 1998 when the applicant was serving the sentence in matter 3 later set aside. 13    The present application is for leave to appeal against sentence, on the ground that Davidson DCJ should have given credit for the period 20 October 1997 to 17 July 1998 as well as for the balance of the period 24 October 1996 to 16 November 1998.  14    If that is correct, Davidson DCJ should have fixed the commencement date of the sentence some nine months earlier. That would have more than taken up the period of six months to be served under that sentence before being released on recognisance. In consequence, the applicant would have been entitled to be released in relation to that sentence well before 15 July 1999, the date on which he was entitled to be released under Hidden J's sentence. 15    The applicant's argument should be upheld for the following reasons. During the period 20 October 1997 to 17 July 1998, the applicant was in custody for two reasons each of which was, at the time, sufficient to cause him to be so held. First, bail had been refused in matters 4 and 5 on 14 July 1997 and revoked in matter 1 on 1 August 1997. They were the matters for which he was sentenced by Davidson DCJ on 12 December 1998. Secondly, he was serving the sentence imposed on 20 October 1997 in matter 3. That was the conviction which was subsequently quashed. 16    The applicant would have been held in custody during the period in question because of matters 1, 4 and 5 irrespective of the sentence in matter 3. Bail was revoked in matter 1 and refused in matters 4 and 5 because matters 4 and 5 gave rise to too great a risk that the applicant would abscond if he was released pending his trial in matters 1, 4 and 5.  17    In these circumstances, the period of custody in question is attributable to matters 1, 4 and 5 irrespective of whether it was also the result of matter 3. By contrast, in relation to matter 3, the conviction for which the applicant was serving a sentence during the relevant period was later quashed. 18    In Niass, (CCA, 16 November 1988, unreported), the sentencing judge had refused to take into account time in custody pending trial on other charges of which the applicant had been acquitted. The relevant principle was stated by Lee CJ at CL as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""There have, of course, been cases where credit has been given in sentencing for periods of incarceration arising directly from the commission of the offence which brings the offender forward for sentence and that practice should be followed. The courts recognise that in dealing with a particular offence it is always appropriate to take into account periods during which an appellant has been held in custody in respect of that offence."" 
         
        
        
       The case fell outside the ambit of that principle because the period in custody was not ""in respect of"" the offence for which the applicant was sentenced. In later cases, time in custody has been disallowed for the same reason:  
       Webster 
        and  
       Jones 
        (CCA, 3 August 1992, unreported),  
       Chung 
        (CCA, 9 March 1994, unreported),  
       David 
        (CCA, 20 April 1995, unreported) and  
       Baartman 
        (Dunford J, 18 December 1998, unreported). 
       
      
     19    In Chung, David and Baartman, the judgments show explicitly that there was no overlap between the relevant period in custody, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, any period in custody, bail refused, in relation to the offence for which the sentence was imposed. There is nothing in Niass or Webster and Jones to suggest there was any such overlap in those cases. 20    The Crown submits that to uphold the applicant's arguments would bring the law into disrepute. It argues that, if bail had not been opposed in matters 4 and 5 on 14 July 1997 and if no application had been made to revoke bail in matters 1 and 3, as occurred on 1 August 1997, the applicant would have no ground on which to claim credit for time served in the period 20 October 1997 to 17 July 1998. It is said to be incongruous that credit should be allowed or disallowed for time served in relation to a sentence set aside on appeal depending on whether bail has been allowed or disallowed in relation to the offence in question. 21    I perceive no such incongruity. Sentencing is a discretionary exercise. Fairness and reasonableness have constantly to be borne in mind. It would be unjust to disallow credit for time in custody pending trial because that time overlapped a sentence later set aside. A sentence set aside should count for nothing against the person concerned, let alone operate to negate an entitlement which that person would otherwise have under the law. The need to avoid injustice in this case outweighs, by a large margin, any incongruity that might be perceived as arising from doing so. 22    I do not think it matters that this point was not raised at the sentencing hearing. That was a mistake. It has resulted in a miscarriage of justice which should be rectified.  
     
      
       
      
    23    The court was informed that the appellant would need to apply for a variation of his bail conditions in matter 3 (in which the new trial has been ordered) before he could be released from custody at this stage. That situation has been taken into account in proposing the following orders.  
     
      
       
      
    24    The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
       1. Application for leave to appeal granted. 
        
       2. Appeal allowed. 
        
       3. Sentence set aside. 
        
       4. In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to twelve months imprisonment commencing on 7 August 1998 and expiring on 6 August 1999, when he is to be released on a recognisance for a period of eighteen months expiring on 6 February 2000. 
       
      
     25    The effect of that sentence is as follows. Provided the appellant is otherwise entitled to be released, he will be released from custody on 6 August 1999 on a recognizance for a period of eighteen months to be of good behaviour, among any other conditions to be determined by the authorities.26    SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with his Honour's reasons and the orders he proposes.  27    I wish to add two matters. 
     
      
       
      
    28    First, the applicant has sought in these proceedings credit for a period in which he was in custody for two separate reasons: the first of those was his conviction on charges under s.319 of the New South Wales Crimes Act. The court has been informed that a new trial will proceed in this matter within a few months. This court is able to give credit for a substantial proportion but not all of the period of that custody in the form of the order proposed by Justice Sperling. What the implications may be for the sentencing, if he should be convicted again, on the s.319 charges will be a matter for the trial judge on that occasion. For the same reason as he was entitled to credit, notwithstanding the fact he was in custody, in effect, for two different reasons, he would not expect to receive credit twice. 29    The second matter is the fact this was a very clear case. Bail had been refused and, in view of the passport offences, it was a very clear case as to what the prognosis for any bail application or change of conditions would have been. Not all cases will be as clear as this. If this matter arises again, the court would not wish to encourage litigation about what may or may not have been the prospects of bail in a case that is not as clear as this one. Subject to this, I agree with everything said by Justice Sperling.30    SIMPSON J: I also agree with the orders proposed and the reasons given by Mr Justice Sperling and the additional remarks of the Chief Justice.31    SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as proposed.

      REGINA v HUNG VAN PHAM 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    LEVINE J: The applicant (who appears in person aided by Mr Coen, interpreter) seeks an extension of time for his application for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed in the Sydney District Court by Her Honour Judge Morgan on 13 February 1998. 
    2    Mr Pham was sentenced for the offence of robbery in company with wounding, a crime for which the maximum penalty is 25 years. At the time of being sentenced for that offence, to which Mr Pham pleaded guilty, through his legal representatives he asked that other offences committed by him on 6 and 7 November 1996 be taken into account, being three charges of goods in custody and one charge of receiving. 
    3    The offence happened in these circumstances. That at about 1:10am on 17 April 1997 Mr Hadjisavvas who was 67 years old, was working in his shop in Surry Hills. Tho Than Le and the applicant entered the shop and went to the back. The victim approached the two men to ask whether he could assist them. Tho Than Le produced a pistol and demanded the money kept in the store. The applicant was armed with a Ghurkha style knife. The applicant and Tho Than Le then set about assaulting the store keeper, the applicant hitting him with the handle of the knife.  
    4    Not long after, the third person involved, Thanh Long Pham came inside, closed the shutter and kept a look out. He attempted to open the cash register and he, Thanh Pham, whilst Mr Le and this applicant were assaulting the shop keeper, struck him with two blows to the rear of the head with a bottle which he, Thanh Pham, had taken from one of the shelves. He continued to keep a look out whilst Le and this applicant continued assaulting the shop keeper and he removed a sum of money from his back pocket.  
    5    A passer by noticed what was happening and called the police who arrived and arrested Tho Than Le and Thanh Long Pham.  
    6    The applicant was discovered hiding in a cupboard at the rear of the shop and was also arrested.  
    7    Two hundred and fifty dollars belonging to the shop keeper was found on the footpath and police found a .32 calibre Browning pistol under a bucket in the rear toilet of the shop and that pistol was found to be loaded. The Ghurkha knife was found under a newspaper on some stairs at the rear of the shop premises. Tho Than Le's car was found parked nearby. 
    8    The shop keeper was taken to hospital where he was found to have suffered severe injuries. 
    9    In her remarks on sentence, having recited the facts generally as I have outlined them, her Honour dealt with Tho Than Le first and found him to have been the person who was in charge of the enterprise giving orders to the applicant to shut the door and to assist in the assault. Her Honour dealt with Tho Than Le's personal background and was very conscious of the seriousness of his conduct. He was sentenced to a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two and a half years.  
    10    Her Honour then dealt with this applicant who she found willingly agreed to take part in the robbery whilst armed with a knife, which she found was an aggravating feature or something that made it more serious.  
    11    A report apparently from Mr John Taylor, a clinical psychologist, was available to the judge who, it appears to me, had regard to it, although it appears that it did not have much to say because of the applicant's lack of memory at that time.  
    12    Importantly, her Honour did not regard this applicant as being the ring leader but she did find that he willingly participated, armed with a knife, most probably to obtain money to satisfy his drug habits. She found that, on balance, there was probably not a great deal of difference between this applicant's involvement and that of Mr Le.  
    13    Mr Le, she found, was the instigator who pre-planned the robbery by obtaining a pistol and borrowing a van. 
    14    Her Honour was well informed of this applicant's personal history in Vietnam, Hong Kong and the Philippines and the unfortunate things that happened to him before he came to this country.  
    15    Mr Taylor, the psychologist, expressed the hope that while in goal the prisoner will feel sufficiently motivated to take classes in English. I interpose from what the applicant has here today said he has taken that step and I add further, speaking for myself, I appreciate that he really wishes to work hard to become a good citizen.  
    16    As I have said the applicant was given the same sentence as Mr Le and I am of the view, particularly taking into account the goods in custody and receiving offences which her Honour was asked to take into account and given the very serious nature of the crime, that no mistake or error was made by her Honour in relation to this applicant, or in relation to this applicant compared to the other two people involved.  
    17    I have read the report of Gillian Tulloh, the psychologist at Goulburn, which seems to me to make clear, in its own way, the type of information that Morgan DCJ had at the time she sentenced the applicant. This was a very serious crime and the learned sentencing judge took into account all relevant matters relating to the crime itself, all relevant matters relating to the applicant himself and in the end made no mistake, in my view, in coming to the sentence she imposed.  
    18    The sentence she imposed also, I would add, particularly by reason of complaint being made about it in relation to Mr Le's sentence, was one that properly related to it and was in the end correct in being the same. 
    19    It will be for Mr Pham, this applicant, to continue his work in goal before he is released on 16 April next year and to continue to help himself after that date. No error, however, having been shown to have been made by Morgan DCJ, I am of the view that the application for extension of time be granted, the application for leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed. 
    20    SMART AJ: I agree. 
    21    LEVINE J: The orders, therefore, will be as I have proposed.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONBADGERY-PARKER AJTuesday, 3 August 1999 
     
      
    No: 70081/98 REGINA v Dean Anthony PRIVETT No: 70014/97 REGINA v Michael PRIVETT JUDGMENT1    HIS HONOUR: The Crown proposed to present at Goulburn on 12 July 1999 an indictment against two accused, Dean Anthony Privett and his brother Michael John Privett, charging that on or about 25 June 1996 at Gundaroo they did murder Dr Peter Browne Rowland.  
     
      
    2    On 7 July 1999 in Sydney counsel for the accused Dean Anthony Privett made two applications: first, that the venue be changed to a place other than Goulburn; and second, that he be tried separately from the co-accused. At the conclusion of the argument I refused the application for change of venue; having considered the matter overnight, on the following day I refused the application for separate trials. I now give my reasons for those rulings.  
     
      
       
      Venue: 
       
      
    3    Section 577 of the Crimes Act 1900 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “577 In any criminal proceeding, if it is made to appear to the Court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that a fair or unprejudiced trial cannot otherwise be had, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that for any other reason it is expedient so to do, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         the Supreme Court may change the venue, and direct the trial to be had in such other district, or at such particular place, as the Court thinks fit, and may for that purpose make all such orders as justice appears to require.” 
        
       
       
      The present application relied upon paragraph (a) of the section.  
       
      
    4    When an accused person seeks a change of venue on that ground, he/she bears the onus of demonstrating to the Court “that a fair or unprejudiced trial cannot otherwise be had”. Ordinarily it is desirable that the trial take place in the district where the crime was committed. It was held in Dorrington (1969) 1 NSWR 381 that “an exceptional case” must be shown in order to secure a change of venue; but that decision appears to me with respect to import into the section words that Parliament has not chosen to use. It appears to me with respect, that the section does not require so stringent a test as was expressed by the Court in Dorrington. It should be applied according to its terms. Certainly the practice of the Court in more recent years has tended not to set the standard so high.  
     
      
    5    In the present case it was contended that a fair or unprejudiced trial cannot be had at Goulburn because of the volume and nature of material published in the print media circulating in the Goulburn region, and the extent and nature of television coverage of the arrest of the accused men and of the committal proceedings.  
     
      
    6    An affidavit sworn by the solicitor for Dean Privett annexed copies of a large number of newspaper reports, and the originals were tendered at the hearing. They have been drawn from (a) the Goulburn Post, (b) the Yass Tribune, (c) the Border Mail, published in Albury, (d) the Sydney Daily Telegraph, (e) the Melbourne Age, (f) the Canberra Times, and (g) possibly other publications (for many of the items tendered are not clearly identified on their face). No doubt the Court can take notice, without any evidence, that the Goulburn Post is published in Goulburn; that Sydney newspapers such as the Daily Telegraph circulate in the Goulburn district, and that so too does the Canberra Times. Generally speaking, however, an accused who seeks to base an application for change of venue on newspaper publicity should show by evidence that the publications relied upon were circulated in the relevant area, that is the area from which a jury would be drawn.  
     
      
    7    The Crown conceded that each issue of the Border Mail is available in Goulburn, but made no such concession in regard to the Yass Tribune and the Melbourne Age. I doubt whether many, if any, in the jury pool would have seen either newspaper.  
     
      
    8    A video tape compilation of material broadcast by various television channels was also tendered, and I viewed it in court in the course of the hearing. It included excerpts from material transmitted on ABC TV and the Prime, WIN and Capital networks.  
     
      
    9    Counsel for the applicant conceded that nothing reported in the press or on television raised matters that were unlikely to come to the notice of the jury in any event through the evidence tendered in the course of the trial. He later (correctly in my view) qualified that concession - some of the material, particularly on television, was directed to informing or recalling to listeners/viewers the outstanding personal qualities of the deceased, a doctor active in treatment of victims of AIDS and in AIDS research and education. The prospect that that material, at least in any great detail or at any length, would get before the jury is slight. The material has the capacity to anger jurors and prejudice them against the killer or killers of Dr Rowland, but obviously does not at all bear on the question of the identity of the killer or killers, nor on any issue the jury will have to determine; and I see no reason to think that appropriate directions to the jury would not overcome any potential for prejudice. The newspaper clippings include a couple that refer to an assault upon Michael Privett whilst on remand in Goulburn Correctional Centre; and a report in the Canberra Times records a remark by the Governor of the prison that, “we believe it may be related to the charges he is facing”. Mr Young directed no submissions to that part of the material although it could conceivably work to the disadvantage of Dean Privett. Again I am satisfied that the usual direction to the jury to disregard media reports will avoid any significant prejudice.  
     
      
    10    In general, the tone of the newspaper reports and the television coverage was suitably restrained. There is no suggestion by counsel that any of it was inflammatory. There is no significant inaccuracy, such as would tend to mislead the jury to the prejudice of either of the accused.  
     
      
    11    In my opinion the applicant has, by a wide margin, failed to make out its case for a change of venue. For those reasons that application was refused.  
     
      
       
      Separate trials: 
       
      
    12    The principles applicable to such an application are clearly established. The starting point always is the desirability that all persons alleged to be concerned in the one crime be dealt with in the one trial: Grondkowski (1946) 1 KB 369; Oliver (1984) 57 ALR 543; Farrell and Cotton (1990) 48 A Crim R 311; Webb & Hay v The Queen (1993/94) 181 CLR 41. But as emphasised in all of those cases, that principle is subject to a most important qualification, expressed by Priestley JA in Oliver, thus: “unless positive injustice would be caused”.  
     
      
    13    The circumstances in which the holding of a joint trial would cause “positive injustice” cannot be exhaustively defined, but in most cases the principles that should guide the judge dealing with such an application are those stated by Hunt J in Middis & Ors (unreported, 27 March 19991, Supreme Court of NSW) in a judgment that has been often since approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal (see, for example, Baartman (unreported, 6 October 1994), Fernando (unreported, 14 April 1999), Georgiou (unreported, 25 May 1999)). Hunt J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Briefly, the relevant principles are that: 
        
       
       
        
        1 Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accursed to be jointed tried with him; 
        
       
       
        
        2 where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial tot he applicant although not admissible against him; and 
        
       
       
        
        3 where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material,  
        
       
       
        
        a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.” 
        
       
      
    14    But the matter does not stop there as Street CJ pointed out in Guldur (1986) 3 NSWLR 12 at 16: 
     
      
       
        
        “The very concept of joint trials imports the likelihood that there may be particularly pockets of evidence admissible only against one of the co-accused.” 
        
       
       
        
        “Separate trials will not be directed in every case in which some evidence is admissible against one or some but not against all accused.” (per Hunt J in  
        Farrell and Cotton 
          
        supra 
        , at 313)  
        
       
      
    15    The clear statement of principle provided by Hunt J in Middis should not be read without regard to his Honour’s consideration, later in the same judgment, of “the public interest in the efficient despatch of trials, the conserving of costs and the avoidance of any inconvenience to witnesses by having to attend a number of trials” (per Priestley JA in Oliver (supra)). Hunt J explained as follows the manner in which the basic principles are to be applied: 
     
      
       
        
        “An applicant for separate trials must demonstrate that there is a real risk (as opposed to a remote possibility) that there would arise in a joint trial prejudice of the type which - if it arises - would result in positive injustice to him”, 
        
       
       
      and that such prejudice outweighs the public interest in the matters identified by Priestley JA. In  
      Jason Roy Richards 
       (16 February 1998, Common Law Division, unreported), after referring to  
      Middas 
      , I said (at 6-7): 
       
       
        
        “The Crown submitted such prejudice as is likely to arise by the admission of the letter into evidence against Morris in the course of a joint trial is prejudice of a kind which can fairly readily be dispelled by appropriate directions to the jury. Obviously, there must always be a question as to whether prejudice resulting from the admission of inadmissible material is capable of being cured in that fashion. There are many cases where it cannot. In some cases it can readily be seen that the potential for prejudice is so great that no conceivable direction by a trial judge, no matter how strongly worded or how often repeated, can avoid it. I do not think this case is like that at all.  
        
       
       
        
        It is a relatively common experience that some evidence in a joint trial is admissible against some only of the accused and some evidence admissible against only others. Judges are accustomed to give directions to the juries as to what material may be taken into account against which accused and ordinarily the system proceeds on the assumption that the jury is capable of understanding and applying and will understand and apply directions of that sort. The need for such directions is obviously enhanced where the material admissible against one is not only inadmissible against the other but highly prejudicial.  
        What has to be weighed in any such case is the level of prejudice likely to survive and operate upon the mind of the jury after they have received appropriate instructions. 
        ”  
        
       
      
    16    I adhere to what I then said, which reflects the same confidence in juries as was expressed by Gleeson CJ (with the concurrence of Carruthers and Finlay JJ) in Coulstock & Summersford (9 October 1991, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported): 
     
      
       
        
        “The entire system of the administration of criminal justice depends upon the assumption that juries comply with directions and instructions that they are given by trial judges, including instructions as to the appropriate way in which to approach the problems that can arise in joint trials.” 
        
       
      
    17    I conclude my reference to the legal principles with a reminder to myself that the first condition identified by Hunt J relates not to the intrinsic strength or weakness of the case against the applicant, but to its comparative strength or weakness when compared with the case against the co-accused. As the Chief Justice pointed out in Baartman (supra), that condition may well be satisfied even where the case against the applicant can be described as “formidable”.  
     
      
    18    Shortly, the Crown case here is: 
     
      
    · that on the evening of 25 June 1996 the accused Dean Privett and one Gary Teale set out from Yass in a car owned and driven by Teale 
     
      
    · that Dean Privett was the instigator of the venture, the purpose of which was to steal some tools, 
     
      
        
      
    · that Dean Privett directed the operation which involved first a relatively short trip to a property near Yass, 
     
      
        
      
    · that access to the property was blocked by a chained gate and that Dean Privett directed the driver to return to Yass where he obtained some bolt cutters, 
     
      
        
      
    · that at Dean Privett’s home in Yass, the two in the car were joined by the accused Michael Privett and Byron Spencer, 
     
      
    · that the car was again driven to the same property where all four entered a shed where they found a quantity of tools, which they stole,  
     
      
        
      
    · that they returned to Yass where the tools were secreted in the backyard of premises occupied by Dean Privett, 
     
      
        
      
    · that Dean Privett then directed the driver to take them to Dr Rowland’s property at Gundaroo, 
     
      
        
      
    · that Dean Privett wished to steal one or more generators, for which he had a likely buyer, 
     
      
        
      
    · that Dean Privett was familiar with that property having done some work there in connection with the house which Dr Rowland was building and expressed to the others the belief that generators could be obtained there, 
     
      
        
      
    · that en route to each property Dean Privett distributed surgical rubber gloves to each man to wear during the theft, 
     
      
        
      
    · that en route Dean Privett produced and loaded a twelve gauge shotgun, 
     
      
        
      
    · that at the property Gary Teale remained with the car while the other three climbed over a fence or gate and approached the two sheds in one of which a light was burning, that while Byron Spencer went to search the other shed the two accused approached the lighted shed, 
     
      
        
      
    · that when he left the car Dean Privett was carrying the loaded shotgun, 
     
      
        
      
    · that Michael Privett kicked down the door and both accused entered the shed, 
     
      
        
      
    · that four or five shots were then fired, one shot striking and killing Dr Rowland and some of the others striking and killing his Great Dane dog, 
     
      
        
      
    · that shortly before that date Dean Privett had acquired a twelve gauge shotgun, 
     
      
        
      
    · that ammunition for that weapon, indistinguishable from that in fact used at the time of the killing, was located in Dean Privett’s home, 
     
      
        
      
    · that Dean Privett made no admissions when spoken to by police but advanced an alibi, which the Crown cannot disprove beyond reasonable doubt independently of proof that Dean Privett was at the scene of the crime in the circumstances set out above, 
     
      
        
      
    · that Michael Privett when first interviewed told police that he had gone to the place with Dean, Teale and Spencer, and in the circumstances described above, and that it was he who first entered the shed carrying the gun and that it was he who shot Dr Rowland, and 
     
      
        
      
    · that Michael Privett subsequently asked to be interviewed a second time, namely on 11 December 1996, and on this occasion retracted his claim to have been the one who fired the gun, saying that in fact it was Dean Privett who carried the gun and fired the fatal shot, and that he was unaware that Dean had taken the gun with him when they got out of the car at Dr Rowland’s property. 
     
      
    19    The bulk of the evidence to establish the Crown case is common to both accused, that is admissible against both. True, it largely depends on the evidence of two accomplices about which the jury will need to be appropriately warned, but a reading of Teale’s statement and Spencer’s two recorded interviews reveals nothing to suggest that the material evidence that each can give is any way suspect. They give a clear and quite circumstantial account of the whole evening’s activities, the logic of which supports the veracity of their evidence that Dean Privett was, contrary to Dean Privett’s own assertion, present at Dr Rowland’s property and closely involved in whatever took place there. Nor is there anything to suggest any collusion between them.  
     
      
    20    There appears to be no evidence admissible against Dean Privett which is not also admissible against his co-accused (in so saying, I observe that since the ruling that there be a joint trial but before preparation of these reasons, I have made a further ruling excluding evidence of part of a conversation between Dean Privett and police which, had it been admitted, might have been available against him but not against his co-accused as evidence of a lie manifesting a consciousness of guilt). Evidence of Dean’s possession of a shotgun such as was used in the killing on the day before the killing appears to me to be admissible against Michael Privett, as tending to support the Crown case that Dean Privett had a gun with him at the farm, but I make that observation conscious that neither counsel has yet addressed any submissions to that question.  
     
      
    21    The evidence admissible against Michael Privett but not admissible against his brother comprises his two recorded interviews.  
     
      
    22    In making an assessment as to whether (in terms of Middis) “the evidence against [Dean] is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against [Michael]”, it is necessary to keep well in mind what it is that the Crown must prove against either man to establish that he is guilty of murder. The Crown does not have to prove against either that it was he, and not the other, who fired the fatal shot, though as I understand the way the Crown will put the case to the jury, it will allege that Dean Privett was the gunman, and that Michael Privett was an accessory present and aiding and abetting, or was party to a joint enterprise to steal or, if the place was occupied, to rob, and contemplated the significant risk that Dean Privett would use the gun with intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm. In the alternative, the Crown will assert that each was present and each was either principal in the first degree or an accessory aiding and abetting, so that it would not be necessary for the Crown to prove which was which. Further, the Crown will allege in the alternative that each was guilty of felony murder.  
     
      
    23    The principle issues which will arise seem therefore to be these - as to Michael Privett, whether it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that he knew that Dean was armed with the shotgun when they left the car to go to the shed: if that is not proved, the Crown will have failed to prove (a) that Michael was party to a joint enterprise to kill, or (b) was accessory aiding and abetting Dean, the actual killer; and will have failed to prove (c) that Michael contemplated use of the gun with malicious intent; and will have failed to prove (d) that Michael was party to one or other of the foundational crimes relied on by the Crown to support felony murder, namely robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon (s97(2)) and break, enter and steal in circumstances of special aggravation, that is to say being armed with a dangerous weapon (s112(3)). There will, as to proposition (c), be a further issue: whether, even if he knew that Dean was armed, Michael in fact contemplated use of the gun with malicious intent. The Crown would have to show also that he knew or had reason to believe (contrary to his denial) that the shed was occupied.  
     
      
    24    As to Dean Privett: whether it is proved beyond reasonable doubt (contrary to his claimed alibi) that he was one of those who went to the scene in Teale’s car, and if so, whether it is proved that he shot Dr Rowland or aided and abetted Michael Privett as the shooter.  
     
      
    25    The case against Michael Privet is not as strong as may at first appear. His first interview is obviously inculpatory, but some parts of it appear relatively easy to test and probably refute; he is in a position to give what the jury might find to be a cogent explanation of his having shouldered the blame (namely, to shelter Dean - see the evidence of Tracey Barbie); and in his second interview he strongly asserts that he did not know that Dean took the gun (which Michael claims to have first seen in the car just before arrival at the property) when he got out of the vehicle.  
     
      
    26    The case against Dean rests on the evidence of Teale and Spencer, both accomplices, but there is, as I have observed, a consistency between them and a fairly circumstantial demonstration of a credible sequence of events, not readily explained on the basis of collusion. There are other small pieces of evidence which may give support to their account (especially evidence which suggests that Dean borrowed money between the first and second ventures) which is at least consistent with their claim that he did so in order to provide petrol for the second excursion.  
     
      
    27    I am not persuaded that the case against Michael, although somewhat different to that against Dean because of the two recorded interviews, is significantly stronger than the case against Dean himself. Further, the evidence admissible against Michael, which makes that difference, adds to the strength of the case against him and is capable of prejudicing Dean’s position, consists of the two recorded interviews, that is to say, of a discrete and easily identified body of evidence. That is a circumstance which greatly facilitates the giving at trial of clear instructions to the jury to put that evidence out of mind while considering the case against Dean and encourages a belief that a jury thus instructed would have no difficulty in understanding what is required of them and little difficulty in abiding by the instructions given so as to true verdict in terms of their oath. Looking at “the level of prejudice likely to survive and operate upon the mind of the jury after they have received appropriate instructions”, I am not satisfied (in terms of Middis) that “there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material”.  
     
      
    28    For those reasons the application for separate trials was refused.

      REGINA v STEPHEN LAWRENCE WELLS 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
    1    LEVINE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him by Coleman DCJ, QC, at Parramatta District Court on 10 September 1998.  
    2    The applicant pleaded guilty on 15 May 1998 to a charge that on 24 March 1997 at Granville whilst under the influence of a drug, namely temazepam and methadone, he dangerously drove a vehicle occasioning death. The maximum penalty available pursuant to s 52A(1a) is 10 years imprisonment. Matters in a Form 2 were taken into account by the learned sentencing Judge relating to four matters of a summary nature, being part of back-up, charges and one matter in respect of an offence of break enter and steal for which the Crimes Act provides a maximum penalty of 14 years penal servitude.  
    3    The applicant was sentenced to a total term of six years made up of a minimum term of four and an additional term of two by reason of special circumstances found by his Honour arising from the age of the applicant, 23 years, that it was his first period in custody and the perceived and recognised need for rehabilitation. The applicant pleaded guilty to this charge as I understand it as an alternative to a charge of manslaughter.  
    4    The facts found by his Honour are: 
     
      
       
       ""On the morning in question he had ingested methadone as he was permitted to do under the program and drove along the Great Western Highway until he came to a set of traffic lights which would have allowed him access along a down ramp to the expressway. When he got to the traffic lights he pulled up behind another vehicle which was being driven by a young man who had his wife and child in the back seat of the vehicle. The prisoner's behaviour at the traffic lights was erratic and as both vehicles proceeded down the ramp he moved his vehicle from side to side behind the vehicle in front in an attempt to overtake it. The vehicles moved down on to the expressway and when they did, moved into a gap which had appeared in the traffic between two trucks. The prisoner then proceeded along the expressway. Both vehicles then travelled in the left lane of the expressway for a short distance. The vehicle in front which had been the vehicle at the lights, then moved into the right-hand overtaking lane and the prisoner also changed into the right-hand lane. The traffic flow at this stage was moving at about 60 kilometres per hour due to a number of vehicles which were present on the M4. The prisoner continued to swap between lanes by crossing the lane line with only half of his vehicle. He made constant attempts to weave between the lanes for several minutes but was unable to overtake or move further through the traffic because of its volume. He then moved his vehicle on to a grass strip along the shoulder of the roadway and then drove along that strip and came back on to the bitumen. He then went back on to the grass strip which is described as a median strip and drove along it in an attempt to overtake traffic which was moving in the right-hand lane. His vehicle then veered sharply to the left and went back on to the bitumen road surface in order to avoid a pole. It is apparent and I accept that the prisoner then lost control of the vehicle as it veered across two lanes of traffic and headed towards a concrete barrier on the left-hand side of the road. As the prisoner's vehicle was veering across the two lanes of traffic it was struck by a truck which was driven by another user on its passenger side. The prisoner's vehicle then went through a gap in the concrete barriers which had been erected to protect workmen who were working for contractors on the extensions to the M4 motorway where his vehicle collided with the late Mr Panebianco who was one of the construction workers who was working behind the barriers and who had at that time apparently no notice of his approach. The unfortunate Mr Panebianco was thrown to the ground and killed instantly. The prisoner's vehicle then collided with a parked vehicle within the construction area which was pushed on to the edge of the roadworks. The prisoner's vehicle went into a spin and during that time the unfortunate Mr Panebianco was hit again and the prisoner's vehicle then came to rest."" 
       
      
    5    The relevant drug analysis disclosed 0.53 milligrams per litre of methadone and 0.20 milligrams per litre of temazepam in the applicant's blood. The temazepam was based upon the applicant's consumption of the drug known as Normison. The pharmacological evidence given by Ms Perl, which was uncontested, was to the effect that at the time of the collision the applicant was under the influence of both drugs to the extent that his driving ability would have been significantly impaired. Apparently the applicant had been stabilised on a methadone program but it was the combination of that drug and the temazepam in the form of Normison tablets to which he had become addicted, that gave rise to the impairment. 
    6    His Honour found the objective facts to be ""on the scale of offences of this type a very serious offence”. 
    7    His Honour found that the prisoner's driving on the day displayed a:  
     
      
       
       ""degree of recklessness and impatience which is absolutely unacceptable. His behaviour in driving his vehicle through the traffic in the way that he did before this unfortunate collision took place in my view objectively placed this matter beyond the middle range so far as the objective seriousness of this offence is concerned"". 
       
      
    8    His Honour accepted the plea of guilty and that it came about at an early stage and demonstrated contrition for what the applicant had done. His Honour was at pains, and quite rightly so in the sense of the exercise of his judicial discretion in sentencing, not to permit the subjective circumstances to outweigh the objective seriousness of the offence. The subjective circumstances were acknowledged by his Honour with the assistance of reports from Dr Westmore, Dr Slezak and Ms Barrier. Particularly did his Honour have regard to the state of the applicant's health and accepted the submission of his counsel that by reason thereof it would be harder for the applicant in serving a full-time custodial sentence than it would be for an able bodied prisoner.  
    9    In the circumstances the applicant complains that the overall sentence of six years with a minimum term of four is manifestly excessive notwithstanding the serious matters to which he pleaded guilty. 
    10    Insofar as statistical information points to the sentence being imposed at an upper end and so far submissions are made that the sentence imposed is indicative of a view taken that it is towards the most serious of its kind, I am unimpressed by them.  
    11    The sentencing by his Honour took place, by an accident of the calendar one month roughly before the decision of this Court in Regina v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and it is artificial in my view given the peculiar nature of this offence now to speak of pre-imposed Jurisic sentencing.  
    12    It seems with respect, more often than not to be overlooked that the offence to which this applicant pleaded guilty is one with which a great deal, or a high proportion of the population would have some familiarity and understanding, because of the number of people who drive cars, who are passengers in cars, who use the highways or are pedestrians. It is for that reason, amongst others, that the component of public general deterrence is of critical importance. It is for that reason, speaking for myself, that whilst it may be instructive to be referred to other cases, whether decided before or after Jurisic and to embark upon an analysis of various factors that may have influenced the sentencing Judge or the appellate court, in the end this particular type of offence because it is so public, because it is so intimately concerned with the every day activities of the great majority of people within the state, that care should be taken particularly to consider each case on its merits. 
    13    The applicant has acknowledged the aggravating factors to have been that his driving ability would have been significantly impaired; his driving was erratic; it was reckless and impatient; it took place over a sustained course and period of time within that catalogue of factors to which the Chief Justice refers in Jurisic.  It is contended however that this is not the worst kind of case that could come within the section. His Honour did not find it to be the worst case, nor was it open to his Honour on the evidence as it appears to me, for his Honour to come to that view of it. It was clearly open, however to his Honour to come to the view he did that it was above the mid range.  
    14    A particular component of this applicant's case before this Court was the state of the applicant's health. The submission was made that it appears that the sentencing Judge did not give sufficient weight to it. If it was given sufficient weight, then that submission, which in my respectful view can so often be made more with facility, than substantive effect, is made his Honour started at ""too high a level"" before allowing the applicant the benefit of the clear finding of his Honour in that regard. His Honour appears quite clearly to have considered the objective circumstances and seriousness of this offence and the subjective features available to the applicant and to have been at pains to ensure there was no disproportion. 
    15    I am not persuaded that the sentence as formulated by his Honour in its respective parts or in its totality by itself or for any other reason, points to any error by the learned sentencing Judge in relation to the discrete matter of the applicant's health or indeed in respect of anything else. The objective facts which I have recited from his Honour's remarks on sentence speak of a course of conduct, even for the reasons giving rise to it, namely the consumption of the drugs, that fairly can be described as above the mid range of seriousness in relation to this offence. 
    16    This event occurred at 10.45am on a Monday on the M4. It is patently obvious that numerous people were at risk and that evidence was available to his Honour to that effect. One of the witnesses remarked upon the applicant’s speed and the recitation of the course of the driving, including the nature strip component, reflects gravely upon the conduct leading to the applicant being before this Court today.  
    17    As I have said his Honour made appropriate findings as to the objective gravity and indeed with respect to his Honour the language he used was temperate. The circumstances to my mind were horrific. His Honour took into account the serious nature of the break enter and steal on the Form 2 and indeed his Honour formed the opinion that the applicant's antecedent criminal record although it was not such as to entitle him to any leniency, was not such as to be taken into account in any respect beyond the relevance of it to the offence of break enter and steal in the Form 2. 
    18    I happen to note that the applicant's driving record displays a flagrant disregard for driving obligations and the laws in relation to being qualified and licensed. For myself I have come to the view that that attitude the responsibilities of a person behind the wheel of a motor vehicle, compounded with the drug abuse, could be said almost to have made this tragedy inevitable at the hands of this applicant.  
    19    I have listened to all that Mr Andrews has said today and given it very serious consideration, particularly that component involving the health of the applicant. I am not persuaded that any error in that regard has been disclosed. By reference to the sentence imposed in all the circumstances in this case, by reference to other cases including decision of my own in the matter of Regina v Hill (CCA, unreported, 4 December 1998) am I persuaded that there is any basis for coming to a conclusion that error has been exposed by his Honour. I would propose that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed. 
    20    SMART AJ: Notwithstanding the subjective features relating to the applicant, the gravity of the offence dictated the sentence imposed. I agree with Levine J and with the orders which he proposes. 
    21    LEVINE J: The orders of the Court will therefore be as I have proposed.

     CLOSED COURT 
    1    LEVINE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Downs QC in the District Court on 2 February 1998.  
    2    The applicant pleaded guilty to one count under s 114 (1)(a) of the Crimes Act which provides a maximum penalty of seven years penal servitude for the offence of being armed with intent to commit, in this instance, robbery.  
    3    The applicant was sentenced to a minimum term of two years and six months, to commence on 1 May 1998, with an additional term of ten months.  
    4    The facts as found by his Honour are as follows: 
     
      
       
       “… at approximately 7.30am on Monday 24 March 1997 the prisoner [GCT] and a co-offender came to the back door, the loading dock door of Franklins supermarket at the Emerton Shopping Village. They were each dressed as police officer. The store manager … was called to the door and observed that one of the two men was carrying a black nylon Adidas bag and one was seen to have what is said to be an air pistol in a holder. 
       
      
      
       
       They indicated to [the manager] that they wished to speak … about a member of the staff and [the manager] took them to [the] office. Whilst proceeding to the office [the manager] was asked not to alert the staff and so when [reaching the] office [the manager] asked the staff member who was in there to leave. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner and [co-offender] indicated that detectives would be coming to the premises at a later stage and they then began to discuss with the manager when, by whom and in what manner the store takings were collected and taken from the premises. 
       
      
      
       
       They were told that the sage could only be opened by the use of two keys, one of which was held by Franklins at the store and the other by Brambles, a security firm who came to collect the takings. 
       
      
      
       
       At some stage whilst this was taking place staff members became suspicious when they could not see a police car and so police were contacted. After being told about the situation with the keys the prisoner and his co-offender left the premises."" 
       
      
    5    On 1 November 1997 the applicant was spoken to by police, initially making full admissions. Later there was a denial of those admissions. However on the same day another interview produced admissions as to the role of this applicant in the offence. He implicated his co-offender and a corrupt police officer.  
    6    Three bases are relied upon in support of the application for leave to appeal. The first is that the learned sentencing judge failed properly to characterise the level of criminality. Second, that his Honour failed properly to consider the provisions and effect of s 442B of the Crimes Act, and third, failed to consider at all whether a finding of special circumstances should be made under s 5 of the Sentencing Act 1989.  
    7    With respect to the first basis, namely the asserted error in his Honour's characterisation of the level of criminality involved in this extraordinary enterprise, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
       ""The prisoner co-operated with the authorities whereby he probably would not have been charged with this offence had he not made admissions and were it not for the fact that he generally co-operated with the authorities, pleaded guilty and has given the undertaking to give evidence in the proceedings concerning the co-offender. And knowing that he has given his undertaking and will give that evidence has thereby placed his safety in jeopardy, particularly whilst he is in custody. Were it not for those facts the penalty I would have imposed would have been close to the maximum that the law provides, namely penal servitude of seven years. However, having regard to all the facts but particularly those matters I have just mentioned, I propose to significantly reduce the sentence."" 
       
      
    8    I myself am persuaded that that cited component of his Honour's remarks on sentence reflects error on his part in characterising the level of criminality. Matters affecting his Honour's conclusion in that regard seem to have been taken into account which would apply de hors or after a proper characterisation of the level of criminality for the purposes of the commencement of the sentencing exercise for the offence itself. 
    9    The offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty is one in which, of course, intent plays a critical part. Care must be taken, in my respectful view, not to look at any matters in aggravation or in mitigation that would constitute a departure from the discrete crime provided for by s 114(1)(a). As the Crown submitted during the course of argument today, had a robbery been attempted then another charge would have been laid; had a robbery been effected then another charge would have been laid.  
    10    But there are in this case, in my view, three matters properly available to mitigate the seriousness of the offence, and I will shortly state them. It is clear that the requisite intention was abandoned. It is clear that the pistol, an air-pistol, was unloaded and it is clear that there was no evidence that anyone was put in fear. Those matters lead, in my view, to a characterisation of this offence not below, not at, but above the mid-range; but certainly, with respect to his Honour, not close to the top of the range attracting the maximum penalty that the law provides. The serious components were the degree of planning, and in my view the impersonation of police officers. Thus the first basis has been made out. The second basis of the application was, as I have said, the failure of the learned sentencing judge to have regard to the components to be taken into account under s 442B of the Crimes Act, which clearly had been enlivened by the tendering of material, some in the usual way, in relation to admissions made by the applicant, and assistance in respect of the co-offender and the corrupt police officer. His Honour does not expressly refer to the section, nor to any of its component parts. It is clear, nonetheless, that his Honour purported to give a substantial discount to the applicant from that erroneous starting point to which I have referred.  
    11    The material before his Honour, as I understand it, seems to indicate that the questions of identity were not unknown to the authorities at the time of the applicant's co-operation with them. It certainly must be acknowledged however that in relation to the co-offender the applicant promised to give evidence. We have been informed that he did give evidence in the committal proceedings, and an inference is available as to its effectiveness by reason of the decamping of that co-offender before the date fixed for his trial. He is apparently still at large. Further, the corrupt police officer, who provided the police paraphernalia for the commission of this offence whilst he was on suspension at the time, we have now been informed, has resigned from the police service. One can observe that it must be inferred to the applicant's advantage that notwithstanding the status of that officer at the time of the commission of this offence, the applicant must have played some useful part in ridding the service of such a member. For myself, the degree of assistance and co-operation would warrant an element of reduction almost coinciding with that imposed by his Honour, with the effect which I will state: that an appropriate overall sentence taking it into account can be regarded as three years penal servitude, representing a discount if one quantifies it of in excess of forty per cent.  
    12    The third basis in support of the application for leave is the matter of special circumstances. His Honour, in the course of his remarks, did two things of relevance to this area. First he indicated that he had particular regard to the material provided by Ms Robilliard, that: 
     
      
       
       ""In choosing to co-operate with the authorities at this stage he is signalling that he is making a determined effort to change his ways. She advised that he should remain on the methadone programme and that he should continue to receive treatment and counselling for his drug addiction."" 
       
      
    13    Otherwise, save for that to which I will come in a moment, his Honour made no reference to or finding of special circumstances.  
    14    The other matter his Honour did was to direct the Probation and Parole authority to act in a particular way concerning counselling and treatment during the period of the additional term. Such a course was not open to his Honour under the Sentencing Act. As Mr Golding rightly submitted, in my view, it does point to his Honour having considered the requirement for counselling and drug rehabilitation as one of special significance. That, it is submitted for the applicant, can properly be accommodated by the adjustment that is usually made when such special circumstances are found. There clearly was before the learned sentencing judge a basis therefor in the material placed before him from Ms Robilliard. 
    15    Reverting for the moment to the s 442B component of this application, it has to be acknowledged that at the sentencing level some circumspection, as was conceded by the Crown in written submissions, must be exercised by a sentencing judge; a quality that must attend, in my view also, the judgment of an appellate court when it is focusing, as it is in this application, on such a matter.  
    16    It is desirable, bearing in mind that constraint, that nonetheless a sentencing judge, in circumstances of the kind that attended this applicant's sentence and its background, refer specifically to the section and identify those matters enumerated in the subparagraphs that affect the awarding of the benefit provided by the section. In the instant case his Honour, without reference to the section or its subparagraphs, it must be said, clearly had in mind some of the matters referred to in subsection 3, one of them being, of course, the effect on the offender in terms of the quality of his incarceration. Further, for example, paragraph (d): ""The nature and extent of his assistance,"" and it must be taken that his Honour had regard to the material handed to him in the usual way in regard to such matters as are referred to in paragraph (b).  
    17    Without embarking upon the useful enumeration of the various subparagraphs referred to by counsel for the applicant, the significance vis a vis the authorities of the assistance and the effect vis a vis the applicant, to cover the two broad areas encompassed by the subsection, are in my view such as to warrant that degree of reduction in terms of percentage to which I have referred. In the end, therefore, I am persuaded that the three bases for the grant of leave have been made out.  
    18    Taking into account the characterisation of the level of criminality, the degree of assistance and its effect, and making allowance for the special circumstance constituted by the requirement for continuing and on-going drug counselling and rehabilitation, I would propose that leave to appeal be granted, that the appeal be abandoned and that the sentences imposed by his Honour be quashed.  
    19    In lieu I propose that there be an overall sentence of three years penal servitude, the minimum term of which will be eighteen months and the additional term, by reason of the special circumstances to which I have referred, will be of the same duration. Thus, the minimum term will commence on 1 May 1998 and expire on 31 October 1999, and the additional term will commence on 1 November 1999 and expire on 30 April 2001. 
    20    SMART AJ: I agree.  
    21    LEVINE J: The Orders will therefore be as I have proposed. The material in the envelope is to be returned to the Crown.

     FRIDAY 16 JULY 1999 
      
      11677/99 - VISY BOARD PTY LTD & ANOR v AUTOMOTIVE, FOOD, METALS, ENGINEERING, PRINTING & KINDRED INDUSTRIES UNION & ORS 
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
    1    HIS HONOUR: On 13 July, last Tuesday, application was made to me ex parte for injunctions to restrain the defendants engaging in various forms of tortious and criminal conduct, including public nuisance, intimidation, assault and malicious damage to property. I granted those injunctions because I was satisfied on the evidence then presented that the defendants were acting in combination in the sense that they were all associating together outside the plaintiffs' various premises in furtherance of an industrial dispute, and some of them were engaging in particular acts of the kind referred to by way of physically blocking access to and from some of the premises, throwing missiles, interfering with the free passage of vehicles on public roads, (for example, by removing keys from the ignition of vehicles), cutting and spiking motor vehicle tyres, deliberately scratching motor vehicles, verbal abuse, and so on. These activities were in conjunction with a picket formed outside the plaintiffs' premises by certain of its employees, members of the first defendant, who are presently and have for some time been on strike in support of a claim for increased wages and conditions. The targets of their activities were other employees who were continuing to work, or seeking to do so, and suppliers and carriers of goods to and from the plaintiffs' premises. 
    2    A large number of affidavits were before me and these were supplemented by video tape evidence taken at the scenes. Mr Robinson, who appeared for the plaintiffs, also tendered Ex A which consisted of three notices of intended industrial action dated 2 June 1999 relating to the plaintiffs' different premises, and he drew my attention to the provisions of s 166A of the Workplace Relations Act (Cth) 1996 (the Act) and to the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in Patrick Stevedores Operations Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia & Ors (1998) 82 IR 237. Having granted the ex parte injunctions, I granted leave to the plaintiffs to serve short notice of the summons which I made returnable for 2 pm the following day, 14 July 1999. I should add that the proceedings before me on Tuesday 13 July commenced at 11.03 am and concluded at 12.50 pm.  
    3    On the return of the summons at 2 pm on Wednesday 14 July 1999, Mr Crawshaw SC and Mr Winters appeared for the first, second and third defendants, and there was no appearance for or on behalf of the other defendants. Further affidavits were filed and read on behalf of the plaintiffs showing in more detail the conduct complained of and two damaged tyres and a number of tyre spikes were also tendered, (Exs F and G). In addition, the plaintiffs tendered letters from the first defendant to the first plaintiff dated 15 April 1999 and 12 May 1999, being Notices pursuant to s 170MI of the Act of an intention to try and reach a Certified Agreement pursuant to Pt VIB of the Act. 
    4    No evidence was led to contradict any of the evidence led by the plaintiffs, but on behalf of the defendants Mr Crawshaw tendered Ex 1, which was a copy of an Application to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (the Commission) for an Order to Stop or Prevent Industrial Action under s 127 of the Act, which the date stamp from the Australian Industrial Registry New South Wales indicated was apparently filed at about 11.30 am.  
    5    Mr Crawshaw then made three main submissions as to why I should dissolve or not continue the existing injunctions. Firstly, he submitted that the first defendant was wrongly named, the correct defendant being the federal body and not the New South Wales Branch. This matter has now been rectified by a consent amendment of the summons which was made yesterday, and is no longer an issue. 
    6    His second submission was that there was no evidence of sufficient weight to link the first, second and third defendants with the specific acts which were the subject of evidence, or with the unlawful acts, and I should not grant injunctions against persons who were not the subject of evidence of particular acts. I dealt with this matter in some short detail in my judgment on that afternoon and I see no reason to change what I said then.  
    7    The third submission of Mr Crawshaw was that the injunction should be dissolved because full disclosure had not been made on the ex parte application in that I had not been informed of the Application under s 127. The plaintiffs' representatives sought time to deal with that submission and I accordingly continued the injunction until 5 pm yesterday, 15 July 1999, and stood the matter over until 2 pm.  
    8    When the matter came before me yesterday, Mr Warburton appeared for the first, second and third defendants. Once again there was no appearance for any of the other defendants, although affidavits of service were filed in court which, without reading them all in detail, I am informed establish that thirty-five of the other defendants have been personally served with the summons. There were some further affidavits read and no evidence of any change of conditions at the site. In addition to adopting the submissions of Mr Crawshaw on the previous day, Mr Warburton made two main submissions. 
    9    Firstly, he again submitted the injunction should be dissolved or not continued because of non-disclosure on the ex parte application, and secondly, that the injunction should be refused on discretionary grounds because of the well-established reluctance of the Common Law and Equity courts to become involved in industrial disputes, and their preference for leaving the resolution of such disputes to the specialised industrial tribunals. 
    10    The application under s 127 sought orders that the relevant employees cease and refrain from industrial action in the form of any strike, restriction or ban or other limitation and make themselves available for work as required by the company in accordance with the relevant award. There were supplementary orders sought to give effect to the main orders. 
    11    The grounds of the application were set out and referred to the employees of the plaintiffs, the majority of whom are members of the first defendant, commencing strike action on 8 July 1999 and also commencing a picket line while the strike action was continuing. Paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 were as follows: 
     
      
       
       ""6. Representatives of the AFMEPKIU and certain employees present on the picket lines have refused, and continue to refuse, access to or egress from the Smithfield operation. Without the direct assistance of the New South Wales Police access to the Smithfield operation, and egress from that operation is almost impossible. 
       
      
      
       
       7. Representatives of the AFMEPKIU and / or certain Employees present on the picket lines have caused damaged (sic) to the motor vehicles attempting to enter and leave the Smithfield operation. 
       
      
      
       
       8. Representatives of the AFMEPKIU and / or certain Employees have made threats to the life and personal safety or health of employees of the Company who have continued to perform work at the Smithfield operation. Such threats have also been made to contractors, and employees of contractors to the Company who have sought access to the Smithfield operation in the course of duties."" 
       
      
      
    12    In an attempted explanation for the failure to disclose this application when seeking the ex parte injunction, there was an affidavit from Helen McKenzie, solicitor for the plaintiffs, in which she said, inter alia, that the sole purpose in seeking the injunction was to remove the illegal pickets and end other unlawful conduct relating thereto with the object of securing unimpeded access to the plaintiff's premises, and that the purpose of the application under s 127 was to secure a resumption of work by the striking employees. She went on: 
     
      
       
       ""The definition of industrial action in the Act (section 4) does not in my view, include participation in a picket and accordingly, the Commission does not have jurisdiction to make orders in respect of the conduct of pickets (whether legal or illegal)."" 
       
      
      
    13    It was also her view that proceedings in this Court were quite separate and unrelated to the decision by the plaintiffs to attempt to achieve cessation of the strike and resumption of normal work by the s 127 application. She said it was not her intention to mislead the Court or withhold relevant information, that it was only after the commencement of the proceedings before me that the s 127 application was finalised and filed with the Commission, and accordingly that counsel appearing for the plaintiffs had not been instructed that such application had been filed. 
    14    Mr Robinson, who appeared for the plaintiffs, said, and I accept, he did not know of the application to the Commission. He also said if he had known, he would have disclosed it. 
    15    I shall consider later in this judgment whether the orders sought or the powers of the Commission under s 127 extend to the type of conduct complained of in these proceedings, but I have already drawn attention to the fact that reference to the conduct complained of in these proceedings was included in the paragraphs I have quoted from the s 127 application. 
    16    The principle as to the duty of disclosure when seeking ex parte relief was authoritatively stated by Isaacs J in Thomas A Edison Limited v Bullock (1912) 15 CLR 679 at 681-2. After pointing out that as a general rule no order should be made to the prejudice of a party unless he has had the opportunity of being heard, his Honour said that in cases of urgency where the court is asked to disregard the usual requirement of hearing the other side, the party moving incurs a most serious responsibility, and stated the principle as being: 
     
      
       
       ""...it is the duty of a party asking for an injunction ex parte to bring under the notice of the court all facts material to the determination of his right to that injunction and it is no excuse for him to say he was not aware of their importance.  
       Uberrima fides 
        is required, and the party inducing the court to act in the absence of the other party, fails in his obligation unless he supplies the place of the absent party to the extent of bringing forward all the material facts which that party would presumably have brought forward in his defence to that application."" 
       
      
    17    The test is not whether the additional material would ultimately have been determinative of the judge's decision whether or not to grant the ex parte injunction, but whether the omitted material is such that the other party would have brought it forward in opposition to the grant of the injunction if he had been present.  
    18    The test of what material must be disclosed was similarly expressed in Town and Country Sport Resorts (Holdings) Pty Ltd & Ors v Partnership Pacific Limited (1988) 20 FCR 540 at 543. See also Ritchie: Supreme Court Procedure NSW para [28.1.1]; Bentley v Nelson [1963] WAR 89; Gilfillan v Gilfillan [1973] 6 SASR 330. 
    19    Mr Robinson submitted that it was not necessary to disclose matter which was not material to the grant or refusal of relief and that approach is reflected in Miss McKenzie's affidavit. But that cannot be the proper test as it throws the judgment of what is material or what might be material onto the applicant's lawyers instead of on the Court. The test of what must be disclosed is as I have indicated, such material as the opponent would have disclosed or brought forward, if present. It was not for Miss McKenzie, or any other representative of the plaintiffs, to decide whether or not the matter was such as would be determinative of the decision to grant relief. 
    20    Accordingly, I am satisfied that the ex parte injunction should not have been obtained at the time it was on account of the failure to make relevant disclosure. But that does not permanently or otherwise disqualify the plaintiffs from obtaining relief. In Thomas A Edison Ltd v Bullock, although his Honour was satisfied that the injunction should not have been granted ex parte, he went on to say at p 683: 
     
      
       
       ""This would not prevent the plaintiffs from applying de novo for an injunction upon the merits as they now appear."" 
       
      
      
    21    His Honour apparently dealt immediately, and without any further initiating process, with the substantive merits of the case, although the plaintiffs were ultimately unsuccessful. 
    22    Likewise in Town and Country Sport Resorts (Holdings) Pty Ltd v Partnership Pacific Limited, the Full Federal Court indicated that it would be appropriate to make a fresh application, although the note at p 546 indicates that such fresh application was not successful. 
    23    A similar situation arose in Barneys Blu-Crete Pty Ltd v Australian Workers Union (1979) 43 FLR 457 where Northrop J said at 475: 
     
      
       
       ""In my opinion, those facts were not and are not relevant to the question of whether the interim injunction should have been granted or not, but in any event, the principle relied upon applies to cases where an application is made to dissolve an interim injunction. The suppression of the relevant facts does not prevent a fresh application for an injunction being heard and determined in the light of all the relevant facts,"" 
       
      
      
     and he referred to  
     Thomas A Edison Limited v Bullock 
     . 
      
    24    The matter was also considered in this State in Bennett v Excelsior Land Investment & Building Company Limited (1893) 14 NSWR (Eq) 179 at 182 when Owen CJ in Eq said: 
     
      
       
       ""If the defendants were coming to dissolve an injunction the court would grant that relief if it was satisfied that there had been a suppression of a material fact, but the plaintiff is now moving the court to continue an injunction which expires today so that there is nothing to dissolve. This is a fresh application made today which the court deals with de novo upon the evidence now before it, so that the principle contended for does not apply ... Of course, I can deal with a past application so far as the costs were concerned, by making the party who obtained an order upon suppression of a material fact pay them, but such a suppression is not a bar to a plaintiff's motion for the continuation of an interim injunction."" 
       
      
      
    25    Mr Robinson has submitted if I was minded to dissolve the injunction, he sought a fresh injunction in the same terms on the same material. 
    26    The second main submission of Mr Warburton was that the injunction should be refused on discretionary grounds because the matter is within the province of the industrial tribunal specifically constituted to deal with disputes of this nature. In this regard he drew my attention to Harry M Miller Attractions Pty Ltd & Ors v Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia & Anor (1970) 1 NSWR 614 at 615 where Street J said: 
     
      
       
       ""But, in point of discretion, it is a well-settled approach in this Court that injunctive relief will not ordinarily be granted where it can be seen that there is another tribunal particularly suited to deal with the matter in issue and having the requisite power and authority to resolve the issues between the parties."" 
       
      
      
     It is, however, important to note the passage which immediately preceded this: 
      
       
       ""It may well be that in particular circumstances, whether by reason of shortage of time, or by reason of some other consideration, the aid of this Court might be appropriately made available to prevent some irremedial infringement of the rights of some individual involved in an industrial dispute or otherwise to vindicate the due observance of the ordinary principles of law which must be enforced throughout the community."" 
       
      
      
    27    Similar statements were made in Slattery & Ors v Public Service Board [1983] 3 NSWLR 41; Mahony v Industrial Registrar of New South Wales [1984] 3 NSWLR 315, Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Australian Public Sector and Broadcasting Union & Ors (unreported, 18 March 1991, Kearney J), Australian Paper Limited v Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia (1998) 81 IR 15 at 24 and Patrick Stevedores Operations Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (1998) 82 IR 237 at 247. 
    28    From these cases I deduce a general proposition that as a matter of general principle or judicial policy, the Common Law and Equity courts will refrain from interfering in industrial or other types of dispute where there is another specialist tribunal which has jurisdiction and sufficient power to provide effective relief in the matter, and it becomes necessary to consider the extent of the powers of the Commission to provide adequate relief in respect of the matters complained of. Section 127 of the Act gives the Commission power to make orders to stop or prevent ""industrial action"" which is defined in s 4 of the Act, and in general terms relates to bans, limitations or restrictions on the performance of work or on acceptance of or offering for work, the type of conduct often referred to as a ""strike"", although not limited to such conduct. Whether that definition of ""industrial action"" includes picketing, has apparently not been determined, although I am informed that it is the subject of a reserved decision in the Commission at the present time.  
    29    The answer to that question may depend on what is meant by ""picketing"", and for present purposes I respectfully adopt what was said by the Full Federal Court in Australian Builders Labourers Federal Union of Australia, Western Australian Branch v J Corp Pty Ltd (1993) 114 ALR 551 at 556 where other authorities are referred to, and I am satisfied that ""picketing"" properly so called is an orderly and peaceful collection of persons outside particular premises in an effort to persuade people not to enter the premises, the object of the picket being the communication of information; but it does not include obstruction, molestation or intimidation of such people. It involves endeavouring to persuade people to take a certain course of action. It does not include using physical force or other violence or obstruction to prevent them taking the opposite course if they are not persuaded. 
    30    Such picketing is not unlawful, subject to any specific statutes that may apply; and is part of the common law rights of freedom of association and freedom of speech. It is unnecessary for me to determine in these proceedings whether ""industrial action"" within the terms of s 4 of the Act includes picketing of such a nature, because it certainly does not include public or private nuisance by blocking public roads or access to property, and it does not include assault or malicious damage to property which constitute breaches of the criminal law and in torts law constitute trespass to the person and to goods respectively. 
    31    The power of the Commission under s 127 extends to making orders relating to ""industrial action"". It may, as I have indicated, extend to picketing in the form described above, but I can see no authority in the Commission to make orders preventing conduct such as that which is complained of here. It may be that the Commission will make orders under s 127, in which case the conduct complained of may cease; but it may be that for a variety of reasons the Commission will not make orders under s 127 thereby permitting the defendants to remain on strike and impose other bans etc, but that situation would not entitle them to engage or continue in the type of conduct here in question. 
    32    It was submitted on behalf of the defendants that in the nature of things when large numbers of people congregate there will be some interference with the enjoyment of life of other persons and this should be regarded as in some way a normal incident of picketing. I reject that submission. Lawful picketing does not include tortious and criminal conduct as described in this case. 
    33    I was also referred to s 170MT of the Act which confers certain immunity to engage in ""industrial action"" which is ""protected action"", which term is in turn defined in s 170ML and is industrial action during the bargaining period for a certified agreement engaged in for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims made in respect of the proposed agreement. Such industrial action must not involve secondary boycotts: s 170MM. It may be, in light of Ex H, that the strike action presently engaged in by the defendants is ""protected action"" within s 170ML. If it is, s 170MT(1) would render s 127 unavailable to the plaintiffs, but it is also important to refer to s 170MT(2) which provides: 
     
      
       
       ""Subject to subsection (3) (which relates to defamation) no action lies under any law (whether written or unwritten) in force in a State or Territory in respect of any industrial action that is protected action unless the industrial action has involved or is likely to involve: 
        
        
       (a) personal injury; or 
        
        
       (b) wilful or reckless destruction of, or damage to, property; or 
        
        
       (c) the unlawful taking, keeping or use of property."" 
       
      
      
    34    If the bargaining period is still current, the subsection expressly excludes from the immunity, at least some, if not all, of the conduct complained of which has involved, or is likely to involve, personal injury or reckless destruction of, or damage to, property. Even if the bargaining period is not still current, so that the current industrial action is not protected action, the provision evinces a clear legislative intention that parties are not to enjoy any immunity or be deprived of their ordinary common law rights in respect of such types of conduct. 
    35    I refer again to s 166A. I have some doubt whether that section is in operation in the present case as it is within Div 7 of Pt VI (see ss 156 to 156A) which, as I read the Act, only applies to boycotts (s 156) as defined in the Trade Practices Act 1974 (s 163). 
    36    If the section is applicable, I am satisfied that these proceedings are not prohibited by s 166A for the reasons given by Wood CJ at CL in Patrick Stevedores Operations Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia. 
    37    I am therefore satisfied that the ex parte injunction should not have been obtained when it was because of a failure to make a material disclosure. However, the proceedings before me on Wednesday and yesterday were not technically proceedings to dissolve the injunction but proceedings to continue the injunction which had initially been limited to expire at 5 pm on Tuesday 14 July 1999. 
    38    In those circumstances, it seems to me that the principle set out by Owen CJ in Bennett v Excelsior Land and some of the other cases applies. I should therefore not dissolve the existing injunction which I have extended until 12 o'clock today, but I should determine whether to continue the injunction beyond that time in light of the circumstances as they now exist, subject to any outstanding questions as to costs. 
     
      
     (The parties sought and were granted a short adjournment. On resumption a video tape (Ex. 2) was tendered and viewed, and counsel further addressed.) 
      
    39    Since delivering my reasons earlier this morning, I have admitted into evidence and viewed a video tape said to be taken in the last two days. The video was not strictly proved, and to that extent was not admissible, but I admitted it to ensure that no relevant evidence was omitted which could be material to determining whether the injunction should be continued. The video shows a number of trucks entering and leaving one of the plaintiffs' premises. It is not clear which premises, but nevertheless, a number of trucks entered and then a number of trucks left. There were a significant number of police present and in view of the other evidence in the case, I am by no means satisfied that those trucks would have entered or left if it had not been for the police presence and the injunctions which I granted earlier this week. 
    40    The second part of the video contained a number of interviews with people at the site, apparently members of the union, and probably defendants. The interviewer was not identified and the questions were what are commonly described in political circles as ""Dorothy Dixers"". I regard the interviews as of no value in determining the issues in this case. I therefore propose to continue the injunctions previously granted until further order. 
    41    The defendants other than the first, second and third, may be notified of this order in the manner set out in order 8 of 13 July 1999. 
     
     (Counsel addressed on costs) 
      
    42    In relation to the costs of the proceedings, Mr Warburton on behalf of the first, second and third defendants, has submitted I should make an order in favour of those defendants for costs on an indemnity basis to uphold a very important principle, namely that full disclosure must be made when seeking ex parte relief. I agree that the principle is important and must be upheld, but as indicated by Owen CJ in Eq in Bennett v Excelsior Land, that principle can be upheld by an appropriate order for costs. 
    43    It seems to me that this is not an appropriate case for indemnity costs. The plaintiffs should not get any costs for making the ex parte application and should pay the costs of the appearances at Court yesterday and the day before when the material not disclosed was raised and argued. However, the plaintiffs have ultimately succeeded in obtaining a continuation of the injunction. Although there may have been good reasons for doing so, as a means of upholding the principle of full disclosure, to require the plaintiffs to present an entirely fresh case, that would have involved a considerable waste of time and money, and it cannot be ignored that the plaintiffs have succeeded on the evidence which they adduced on both the ex parte application on Tuesday and the return of the summons on Wednesday. 
    44    It seems to me, therefore, that the plaintiffs should get the costs of the preparation of the case in the sense of the preparing and filing of affidavits and the costs of today when they have ultimately succeeded. 
    45    I therefore make the following orders: As to the costs reserved on Tuesday 13 July 1999, I make no order for such costs. I order the plaintiffs to pay the first, second and third defendants' costs of the appearances at court on Wednesday 14 July and Thursday 15 July. I order the defendants to pay the plaintiffs' costs of preparation of the material, including affidavits, and the plaintiffs' costs of the appearance in Court today. Liberty to any party to apply on twenty-four hours notice.

        REGINA v. SHANE FRASER 
        
        
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
      
     
     
      
     1 SMART AJ 
     : Shane Fraser has sought leave to appeal against the severity of his sentence comprising a minimum term of penal servitude for twelve months and an additional term of eighteen months for the offence of robbery. A further offence of possession of a prohibited drug, 52.3 grams of cannabis, was taken into account. We also take that matter into account. 
      
     2 On 26 October 1998 the applicant and his co-accused or accomplice walked along the streets of Summer Hill discussing how they would obtain money for the purchase of heroin. It was decided to select a shop or store which would offer the least resistance. They went into a number of shops looking for a till to rob and ultimately selected the Summer Hill Pharmacy.  
      
     3 They had made two visits. They returned a third time when there were no other customers in the pharmacy and approached the victim, a lady standing behind the serving counter. They demanded money. As a result the victim opened the till and both men reached across, removed a combined sum of $180 in notes and ran out of the shop.  
      
     4 Immediately prior to their demand the co-accused had attempted to exchange a needle or needles, perhaps for both men, and had been unsuccessful. There was a second lady, the pharmacist, in the shop. The judge found that these two ladies were frightened and that is obviously so. 
      
     5 The applicant was aged twenty-three and the co-accused was aged twenty-four. The activities of the two men within the shopping centre were captured on video tape so it was only a matter of time before they were arrested. They were not wearing disguises. 
      
     6 The applicant was arrested in his room in a boarding house. This is where the cannabis was found. The judge found that the applicant gave information to the police pretty nearly as soon as spoken to, gave them a full confession and entered his plea of guilty to the charge at the first opportunity. The judge also found that the applicant was remorseful. 
      
     7 The judge accepted that the applicant came from an unhappy and disrupted family. His father was an alcoholic and violent. There was more trouble in the family when a step-father came upon the scene. For much of his childhood the applicant had not had the benefit of a stable home. When he was about fifteen or sixteen conditions became intolerable to him so he left home and lived on the streets. 
      
     8 He appeared in the Children's Courts in 1991 and 1992 for two dishonesty offences and lesser offences. He re-shaped his life, settled down, did a course and worked well, making good progress until a relationship he had with a young lady broke up. She was being unfaithful. This upset him to such an extent that he lost his balance. He tried to solve his problems by taking heroin. That was done in the company of his co-accused. 
      
     9 In 1994 he was fined on four motor vehicle offences. His record does not disentitle him to receive some leniency. He had been out of trouble for some years. The judge was correctly impressed with the steps the applicant was taking to improve himself and to rehabilitate himself.  
      
     10 A former employer who spoke highly of the applicant was prepared to re-employ him on his release. The applicant was, at the date of sentence, in strict protective custody being very apprehensive about the violence in gaol.  
      
     11 The judge took the view that, as there were no exceptional circumstances, the decisions of the Courts required that he impose a custodial sentence. The judge thought that the applicant had tried hard but that the aspect of personal and public deterrence was important.  
      
     12 The judge correctly found that there were special circumstances. He noted that the co-accused was involved in a large number of robberies and was given a sentence of some six years with special circumstances.  
      
     13 Complaint was made about the information which the judge was given by the Crown about the co-accused. The judge was told that he had been sentenced for two armed robberies and the subject robbery and that the co-accused had received concurrent terms of penal servitude with a minimum term of two years and an additional term of four years. In fact, for the robbery offence, the additional term was two years. 
      
     14 It is a pity that the reasons of Karpin DCJ, who dealt with the co-accused, were not available. The two unrelated armed robberies were very serious with the co-accused wielding a knife in each case as he held up a service station attendant. He had been given the benefit of a Griffiths Remand and, while on remand and twelve months later, participated in the subject robbery. 
      
     15 The co-accused committed an armed robbery in 1992 when he was under eighteen and was sentenced to a control order. His other offences involved dishonesty and drugs. He had been involved with heroin for some years.  
      
     16 Karpin DCJ reviewed the subjective features at some length. What weighed with her were the extremely serious armed robbery offences and the commission of the further offence of robbery while the co-accused was on bail on remand awaiting sentence and supposedly endeavouring to rehabilitate himself. None of these features apply to the applicant. 
      
     17 The applicant correctly submitted that he warranted a much lesser sentence than his co-accused. The judge was at a disadvantage in not being supplied with the Remarks on Sentence of Karpin DCJ and not having the benefit of her review. The judge commented correctly that it would have been desirable for the same judge to have sentenced both men. The judge was alert to the principle of parity. 
      
     18 Given the much greater overall criminality of the co-accused and his less favourable subjective features, it would normally be expected that the applicant would have received less than half the minimum term which the co-accused received. In my view regard must be had to both the full term and to the minimum term. 
      
     19 It was next submitted that the judge erred when he said: 
      
       
        
         
          “The Courts in this state have said that the only time that a person who involves himself into crimes such as this can escape a custodial sentence is if there are exceptional circumstances.”  
         
        
       
       
        
       There is no doubt that such a principle applies in cases of armed robbery and robbery with circumstances of aggravation.  
       
      
     20 Generally, the offence of robbery will attract a custodial sentence, as it should do in this case, but the offence, while serious, is slightly less grave than armed robbery or robbery with circumstances of aggravation. In cases where the robbery is at the bottom of the range of robbery offences and there are compelling subjective features, a full-time custodial sentence may not always be required. The judge has slightly over-stated the position for offences of robbery. 
      
     21 The Crown contended that the question was not whether the Judge correctly stated the law but whether the sentence was manifestly excessive. If there is an error in that the applicable principle has been slightly over-stated, then it is open to this Court to re-sentence. It may take the view that the sentence imposed was in any event the lowest sentence which could reasonably and permissibly be imposed. 
      
     22 The applicant further contended that, the figures provided by the Judicial Commission indicated that, of those persons in a similar age category as the applicant who pleaded guilty, had prior offences of a different type, only sixty or perhaps sixty-three per cent were sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  
      
     23 It was contended that the minimum term of twelve months was statistically disproportionate given that the applicant's prior offences were not extensive and the more serious ones were committed when he was a juvenile. 
      
     24 I do not think that either party gets a great deal of assistance in this case from the figures provided by the Judicial Commission. They do seem to point to the general rule that in robbery cases a custodial sentence is generally imposed. 
      
     25 I have come to the conclusion that, in all the circumstances of this case, the sentence imposed was excessive and that, in lieu of the minimum term of twelve months, a minimum term of nine months should be imposed. I would not alter the length of the full term.  
      
     26 Leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal allowed. In lieu of the sentence imposed upon the applicant, a sentence comprising a minimum term of nine months and an additional term of twenty-one months should be imposed upon him.  
      
     27 STUDDERT J: I agree.  
      
     28 The orders then will be those proposed by Mr Acting Justice Smart. The commencing date would be 26 October 1998, the minimum term to expire on 25 July 1999. The additional term then will commence on 26 July 1998 and expire on 25 April 2001.

     60336/99 
     SPIGELMAN CJ GROVE J BARR J Wednesday, 7 July 1999 
     
     REGINA v Afif ABDULLAH & Ors 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   SPIGELMAN CJ: I would ask Barr J to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2   BARR J: The applicant, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, seeks leave pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act to appeal against an order made in the District Court on 17 June 1999 during the hearing of interlocutory applications by two accused, Afif Abdullah and Ibrahim Hatem, whose trial was about to commence. The solicitor for the applicant, who had been required by subpoena to attend and produce documents, raised a claim of public interest immunity in relation to the documents and the material they contained and in respect of certain other communications and information which it became apparent defence counsel intended to make public by cross-examination of Crown witnesses. 
     
      
    3   The two accused have been made respondents to this application. However, the Court has been informed that a permanent stay of proceedings has been ordered in favour of Hatem. He is therefore not represented today. 
     
      
    4   The respondent Abdullah is represented by Mr Sukkar, solicitor, who, when invited to make submissions, responded that the disposal of the application was a matter for the Court. 
     
      
    5   The Crown also is represented but takes a neutral role and has not been called upon. 
     
      
    6   The two accused were to be tried for the supply of illegal drugs. As often happens during the investigation of such matters, a confidential informer was used. The facts may be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    7   The confidential informer told police officers that a man who has throughout been referred to as “Johnny” was prepared to approach Abdullah to buy heroin. The police spoke to “Johnny”, as a result of which he got in touch with Abdullah and made arrangements to do business with him. Police watched their movements. “Johnny” and Abdullah agreed to meet at a reception centre run by Abdullah. That was on 29 October 1993. 
     
      
    8   “Johnny” went to that place and took purchase money. Abdullah was there and directly or indirectly referred “Johnny” to Hatem, who was in a nearby part of the premises. Hatem supplied the drug. The police closed the net and arrests were made. 
     
      
    9   It appears that a man called Hani Rahme was present but it is not and never was clear, and there was no agreement, that he was a confidential informer. 
     
      
    10   The proceedings before his Honour consisted in part of what is known as a Basha inquiry, in which witnesses which the Crown proposed to call in the case could be cross-examined in the absence of the jury. One such witness was the man “Johnny”. Counsel for Abdullah made clear that he wanted to ask “Johnny” about his relationship with the man called Hani Rahme and asserted that Rahme had been present at relevant times during the investigation or the supply. 
     
      
    11   The Crown Prosecutor asked that Abdullah’s counsel explain and justify the scope of the proposed cross-examination. I will set out in the judgment some extracts from the transcript. Counsel said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ... it is quite clear from the transcript the other person is the person that introduced Johnny to the police. His capacity thereafter is informant. 
        
       
      
    12   Later, counsel said: 
     
      
       
        
        … the basis of the Basha inquiry goes deeper than that, your Honour, to the extent that the accused wishes to explore with the witness Johnny the relationship as between himself and the other person if indeed the other person is Hani Rahme how he came to be in contact with the other person and to ask some questions about that other person. In the committal proceedings it also emerges as regards Hani Rahme that he - now at one point Agent Mayo says it might not be, it might be another Hani Rahme or some such, although that is a matter for weight I suppose at this stage. My instructions are to explore whether or not Hani Rahme is in fact a convicted drug dealer and just what the circumstances were by which this nexus between Hani Rahme or the other person and Johnny came to exist. Because it would seem to me in my respectful submission that this person who has brought Johnny into the matter not being a regular registered police informant that it would be unfair if Mr Abdullah can’t examine whether or not this other person or this missing link had an axe to grind or had some partiality which would reflect upon the motives for him involving the person Johnny and the relationship between the two of them. 
        
       
      
    13   Later, counsel said: 
     
      
       
        
        This is what juries are called to decide but then in the background, your Honour, there is a possibility which is only a speculative - what if for example Hani Rahme had some motive to get rid of my client? One could imagine various possibilities but the jury would be called to decide in relation to a particular transaction which would be placed before them in the indictment. 
        
       
      
    14   The solicitor then appearing for the applicant was invited to address the Court and said this: 
     
      
       
        
        I have an application to make in relation to the evidence that Johnny might give in connection with this matter and that application is that any evidence that he might give be asked to give that would tend to identify the informer in connection with this matter is the subject of a public interest privilege claim. 
        
       
      
    15   The solicitor handed to the trial judge a confidential affidavit, about which it is not necessary to say more. This Court has seen the same affidavit. The solicitor made clear - and it may be accepted - that there was no evidence before his Honour and had been none before the Local Court as to the identity of the informer. Any assumptions by either of the accused about the identity of the informer were no more than assumptions. 
     
      
    16   It was asserted by the solicitor for the applicant that counsel for Abdullah was fishing. 
     
      
    17   Although counsel for Hatem made submissions as well, they can be put aside for present purposes in view of the fact that Hatem is no longer an active party to these proceedings. 
     
      
    18   In his submissions counsel for the applicant referred his Honour to the decision of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Cain v Glass (No 2) (1985) 3 NSWLR at 230. 
     
      
    19   His Honour gave a short judgment as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (Solicitor for Applicant), I am against you on the privilege in relation to the informant. I would not be willing to uphold it. In my view, it would be manifestly unjust to prevent counsel for the accused cross-examining Johnny, whose identity should be preserved, as to his relationship with the informant referred to in the evidence. I reach that conclusion having regard to all that is known to me about this case so far, including the material in the affidavit which was confidentially tendered, that being an affidavit of Mr R R McDonald of the Australian Federal Police. 
        
       
      
    20   The identity of a police informer has, as a matter of public policy, been protected against disclosure at least since Marks v Beyfus (1890) 25 QBD 494 at 498 and 500. This species of public interest immunity was recognised in many cases, including Duncan & Anor v Cammell Laird and Company Limited [1942] AC 624 at 633 and 634; Rogers v Home Secretary [1973] AC 388 at 401-407; Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 61; and Cain v Glass (No 2) at 233-234, 242 and 246-247. It covers any material by which a shrewd idea might be conveyed as to the identity of the informer: Rogers v Home Secretary at 401. 
     
      
    21   The rationale is that if the identity of an informer were liable to be disclosed in a court of law, sources of information would dry up and the police would be hindered in their duty of preventing and detecting crime: D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children [1978] AC 171 at 218, 232 and 241; Sankey v Whitlam at 65-66; and Cain v Glass (No 2) at 247. 
     
      
    22   There is an exception to the rule, in that disclosure of the identity of the informer will be ordered when required to establish the innocence of an accused person.: Marks v Beyfus at 498 and 500; D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children at 218 and 232; Sankey v Whitlam at 42. See also Attorney General for New South Wales v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667, in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL beginning at 669, but particularly at 674 and 675. 
     
      
    23   This exception was dealt with in the judgment of McHugh J in Cain v Glass (No 2) at 246 and 247. His Honour referred to the judgment of Lord Diplock in D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children at 218: 
     
      
       
        
        By the uniform practice of the judges which by the time of  
        Marks v Beyfus 
         25 QBD 494 had already hardened into a rule of law, the balance has fallen upon the side of non-disclosure except whereupon the trial of a defendant for a criminal offence disclosure of the identity of the informer could help to show that the defendant was innocent of the offence. In that case, and in that case only, the balance falls upon the side of disclosure. 
        
       
      
    24   Public interest immunity applies as much to proposed oral evidence as well as to the contents of documents: Sankey v Whitlam at 38; Young v Quin (1985) 4 FCR 483 at 485 in the judgment of Bowen CJ; Marks v Beyfus at 491; and Signorotto v Nicholson [1982] VR 413 per Fullagar J at 423 and 424. 
     
      
    25   His Honour was required in conformity with these authorities to enquire as to the factual basis upon which defence counsel justified the proposed examination. It was only if defence counsel could show that the desired evidence could help to show that the defendant was innocent that the claim of public interest immunity could be rejected and the proposed cross-examination permitted. 
     
      
    26   I am unable by reading his Honour’s judgment or by reference to any of the remarks recorded during the debate as it appears in the transcript with which the Court has been furnished to find that his Honour undertook the appropriate inquiry. It does not appear from his Honour’s judgment how it would have been manifestly unjust to prevent counsel for the accused from cross-examining “Johnny” as to his relationship with the informer. 
     
      
    27   Counsel for Abdullah adduced no evidence before his Honour. All the claims, such as they were, were made from the bar table. It seems to me quite clear from what counsel said that there was no legitimate basis upon which to call forth the desired evidence with a confident expectation that it would tend to show the innocence of his client. I refer, for example, to the desire to: 
     
      
       
        
        ... explore whether or not Hani Rahme is in fact a convicted drug dealer and just what the circumstances were by which this nexus between Hani Rahme or the other person and Johnny came to exist. 
        
       
      
    28   Another example is the statement that: 
     
      
       
        
        It would be unfair if Mr Abdullah cannot examine whether or not this other person or this missing link had an axe to grind. 
        
       
      
    29   It was for counsel for Abdullah to demonstrate to the Court that he was entitled to cross-examine for the relevant purpose. In my opinion, counsel did not do so. Nothing in what counsel said, even accepting everything at face value, would seem to me to justify a conclusion that any of the desired evidence would tend to prove the innocence of Abdullah. In my opinion, the learned trial judge ought to have upheld the claim for public interest immunity in accordance with the principles I have summarised. 
     
      
    30   I would propose that the applicant have leave to appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act and that the appeal be allowed. 
     
      
    31   SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree and would only add this. The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police has instituted these proceedings in his own name. In Attorney General v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 the Attorney General for New South Wales instituted an application, in effect, on behalf of the Commissioner for Police. These proceedings are brought under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Section 5F(2) gives the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions standing to bring such an appeal and subs (3) gives such standing by way of leave to any other party to proceedings. Those proceedings are as defined in s 5F(1). 
     
      
    32   The issue has been referred to on a number of occasions in this Court, including in the case of Stig, NSWCCA, 17 October 1996, unreported, where it appears that the same counsel appeared for both the Attorney and the Commissioner. The matter is also referred to in the case of Keeling, unreported, 5 September 1996, particularly in the judgment of Cole JA at 19-20. 
     
      
    33   No point was taken with respect to this matter in the present proceedings, so it is not necessary to decide the precise standing of the Commissioner suing in his own name. 
     
      
    34   I agree with the orders proposed by Barr J. 
     
      
    35   GROVE J: I agree with the judgment delivered by Barr J. 
     
      
    36   SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the Court are as indicated by Barr J.

       REGINA v Brian James YOUNG 
       
      
    A District Court judge declined to grant the appellant, a defendant charged with sexual assault and indecent assault, access to patient’s notes, records and files which had been produced in response to subpoenas issued on behalf of the appellant and directed to the Tamworth Base Hospital, a sexual assault service attached to that hospital and to a psychiatrist.The complainant to the assaults had disclosed that she was suffering from depression, that she had previously been admitted to the psychiatric ward of the Tamworth Base Hospital, that she had previously been sexually abused and that she had withdrawn an allegation of sexual assault which she had made against a person other than the appellant. The subpoenaed material came into existence in the course of the complainant’s treatment.In the District Court, objection was taken to the production of the documents on the ground of sexual assault communications privilege pursuant to Div1B of Pt3.10 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). It was conceded before Judge Freeman (and accepted in this Court) that the appellant’s subpoenas served a legitimate forensic purpose. Judge Freeman held that Div1B applied derivatively to the production of the documents. His Honour also held that confidential sexual assault communications attract public interest immunity (s130 of the Evidence Act).HeldAppeal allowedA Construction of Div1BThe Court Div1B does not, properly construed, apply to the production of documents. The interpretation of Div1B submitted by the respondents is not “reasonably open”. The language used by the legislature covers only the adduction of evidence in court and cannot be construed so as also to apply to the production of documents on subpoena: Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones [1980] AC 74; Kingston v Kiprose Pty Ltd  (1987) 11 NSWLR 404; CIC Insurances Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1995-97) 187 CLR 384; Telstra Corporation v Australia Media Holdings & Ors (1997) 41 NSWLR 277; Aikins v Abigroup Limited (1998) 43 NSWLR 539; Adelaide Steamship Co Limited v Spalvins (1998) 152 ALR 417; Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commission of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia (1998) 159 ALR 664; Northern Territory v GPAO (1999) 161 ALR 318.Per Spigelman CJ, Abadee and Barr JJ agreeing While the construction of words actually used by Parliament in an act may involve giving them an effect as if they contained additional words, the Court cannot introduce new words into an act. The Court cannot take an expression of intention from extrinsic materials to supply an omission by the draftsperson, when the result cannot reasonably be deduced from the words actually used by a recognised technique of statutory construction. Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones [1980] AC 74; Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v FCT (1981) 147 CLR 297; R v Bolton; Ex parte Beane (1987) 162 CLR 514; Tokyo Mart Pty Ltd v Campbell (1988) 15 NSWLR 275; Bermingham v Corrective Services Commission of NSW (1988) 15 NSWLR 292; Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd (1996-97) 191 CLR 88 referred to.B Derivative ApplicationThe Court Div1B does not apply derivatively to sexual assault communications. R v N, unreported, NSWCCA 21 July 1998 held to be incorrect.Per James J There is only one common law in Australia: Lange v Australian Broadcasting Commission (1997) 189 CLR 520. The common law in those jurisdictions in Australia in which a statutory privilege against production exists cannot be modified by analogy with the statute so that the common law differs in different jurisdictions. Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commission of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia (1998) 159 ALR 664 applied.Per Spigelman CJ The authorities concerned with the effect of the Evidence Act on legal professional privilege do not determine the present case. There is no relevant preexisting common law doctrine. Aikins v Abigroup Ltd (1998) 43 NSWLR 639 and M v L (1999) 1 NZLR 267 distinguished. 
     
      
     
     
      
    C Public Interest ImmunityPer Spigelman CJ, Abadee, Barr and James JJ, Beazley JA dissenting Sexual assault communications are not immune from production on the basis of public interest immunity. Public interest immunity is concerned only with the conduct of governmental functions. The Court cannot limit access to information on the basis of weighing the public interest in disclosure against any factor that can be described as a public interest: Australian National Airlines Commission v The Commonwealth (1975) 132 CLR 582; Sankey v Whitlam (1979-80) 142 CLR 1; Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority v Maurice (1986) 20 FCR 104; Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1992-93) 176 CLR 604. Marks v Beyfus (1890) 25 QBD 494; D v NSPCC [1978] AC 171 referred to. The provision of sexual counselling services to individuals in not governmental in character.Per Spigelman CJ, Abadee and Barr JJ agreeing. There is no evidence before the Court that the possible effect of disclosure on reporting of sexual assaults is of sufficient significance. No attempt was made to present to the Court in a systematic way a comprehensive and balanced body of material on this subject.The Court should exercise restraint in developing the common law in a field in which Parliament has recently passed legislation. Per Spigelman CJ The precise formulation in Div1B poses a different inquiry from that involved in a public interest immunity balancing exercise. Per James J Possible anomalies referred to. Per Abadee and Barr JJ The Court is being asked to legislate which it has no power to do. The case may, alternatively, be seen as involving competing social claims the resolution of which should be left to Parliament: Breen v Williams (1994) 35 NSWLR 522 per Mahoney JA at 557 and on appeal Breen v Williams  (1995-96) 186 CLR 71 at 115.Per Beazley JA dissenting The risk of disclosure of communications with counsellors inhibits the reporting of sexual assaults. The immunity asserted can be developed by analogy with the existing category of police informer immunity. D PrivilegePer Spigelman CJ, Abadee and Barr JJ agreeing A limited number of privileges are recognised by the common law. An intermediate appellate court should be slow to develop a new category of privilege. McGuinness v The Attorney General of Victoria (1939-40) 63 CLR 73 per Dixon J referred to.It is only appropriate to formulate a new public policy when this is capable of precise statement and when the new public policy reflects so widely held an opinion that the Court’s reasoning can be described in terms of ‘recognition’ and not ‘creation’. Authorities recognising a new privilege referred to: Relationships Australia v Pasternack (1996) 133 FLR 462; Jaffee v Redmond (1996) 135 L Ed 2d 337; R v Bull (1997) 17 SR(WA) 364; M(A) v Ryan (1997) 143 DLR (4th) 1; Howe v South Australia & Belperioi (1998) 196 LSJ 182.It has not been demonstrated that the privilege has attained the requisite level of community acceptance. Wilkinson v Osborne (1915) 21 CLR 89; In Re Jacob Morris (1943) 43 SR(NSW) 352; Dietrich v R (1992) 177 CLR 292; Breen v Williams (1995-96) 186 CLR 71.The evidence and additional materials before the Court is limited. There is no systematic review of expert literature. The Court cannot be satisfied that the full range of relevant materials is before it.

       REGINA v Brian James YOUNG 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1   SPIGELMAN CJ: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of James J. His Honour sets out the factual background to this appeal, identifies the four issues that arise for decision and summarises the submissions made. I gratefully adopt his Honour’s judgment in these respects. 
     
      
    2   Subject to the additional observations I make below, I also adopt his Honour’s reasons and his conclusions. 
     
      
       
      Statutory Construction 
       
      
    3   The basic issue is what, if anything, should the courts do when it appears that Parliament has failed, apparently by inadvertence, to deal with an eventuality required to be dealt with if the purpose of a statute is to be achieved? The extrinsic materials set out in the judgment of James J indicate that at least some of the legislators recognised that the adverse effects of revelation of protected confidences, within Division 1B of the Evidence Act, would occur from disclosure by way of ancillary process, as much as from use in evidence in court. 
     
      
    4   James J has annexed to his judgment the additional words which this Court should insert in Division 1B, according to the submissions made on behalf of the Attorney-General and the New England Area Health Service. 
     
      
    5   The proposition that a court can introduce words into an Act of Parliament offends a fundamental principle of our constitutional law. It is no part of the function of any judge to amend legislation. The task of the courts is to determine what Parliament meant by the words it used, not to determine what Parliament intended to say. (See Stock v Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd [1978] WLR 231 at 236G; Black-Clawson International Ltd v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG [1975] AC 591 at 613G, 645C-D; R v Bolton; Ex parte Beane (1987) 162 CLR 514 at 518; Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd (1995) 185 CLR 410 at 459. 
     
      
    6   In order to construe the words actually used by Parliament, it is sometimes necessary to give them an effect as if they contained additional words. This is not, however, to introduce words into the Act. This involves the construction of the words actually used. Judicial statements which appear to have been prepared to countenance something more than this, should be so understood. 
     
      
    7   The most frequently cited formulations are: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a strong thing to read into an Act of Parliament words which are not there, and in the absence of clear necessity it is a wrong thing to do”. ( 
        Thompson v Goold & Co 
         [1910] AC 409 at 420 per Lord Mersey) 
         
        
       
      and 
       
        
        “…we are not entitled to read words into an Act of Parliament unless clear reason for it is to be found within the four corners of the Act itself”. ( 
        Vickers, Sons & Maxim Ltd v Evans 
         [1910] AC 444 at 445 per Lord Loreburn LC) 
        
       
       
      To similar effect is the following formulation: 
       
        
        “Additional words ought not to be read into a statute unless they are required in order to make the provision intelligible”. ( 
        Wills v Bowley 
         [1983] 1 AC 57 at 78B) 
         
        
       
      
    8   The process by which words omitted by inadvertence on the part of the draftsperson may be supplied by the Court, must remain capable of characterisation as a process of construction of the words actually used. 
     
      
    9   The contemporary approach is as set out by Lord Diplock in Wentworth Securities v Jones [1980] AC 74 at 105-107: 
     
      
       
        
        “My Lords, I am not reluctant to adopt a purposive construction where to apply the literal meaning of the legislative language used would lead to results which would clearly defeat the purposes of the Act. But in doing so the task on which a court of justice is engaged remains one of construction; even where this involves reading into the Act words which are not expressly included in it.  
        Kammins Ballrooms Co Ltd v Zenith Investments (Torquay) Ltd 
         [1971] AC 850 provides an instance of this; but in that case the three conditions that must be fulfilled in order to justify this course were satisfied. First, it was possible to determine from a consideration of the provisions of the Act read as a whole precisely what the mischief was that it was the purpose of the Act to remedy; secondly, it was apparent that the draftsman and Parliament had by inadvertence overlooked, and so omitted to deal with, an eventuality that required to be dealt with if the purpose of the Act was to be achieved; and thirdly, it was possible to state with certainty what were the additional words that would have been inserted by the draftsman and approved by Parliament had their attention been drawn to the omission before the Bill passed into law. Unless this third condition is fulfilled any attempt by a court of justice to repair the omission in the Act cannot be justified as an exercise of its jurisdiction to determine what is the meaning of a written law which Parliament has passed. Such an attempt crosses the boundary between construction and legislation. It becomes a usurpation of a function which under the constitution of this country is vested in the legislature to the exclusion of the courts.” 
        
       
      
    10   The passage has been adopted and applied in this Court. (See Kingston v Keprose Pty Ltd (1987) 11 NSWLR 404 at 422 per McHugh JA (an authority frequently quoted with approval, eg. in Bropho v Western Australia (1991) 171 CLR 1 at 20); Tokyo Mart Pty Ltd v Campbell (1988) 15 NSWLR 275 at 283 per Mahoney JA: Bermingham v Corrective Services Commission of NSW (1988) 15 NSWLR 292 at 299-300 per Hope JA; 302 per McHugh JA. See also Saraswati (1990-91) 172 CLR 1 at 22 per McHugh J and Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd (1996-97) 191 CLR 85 at 113 per McHugh J). 
     
      
    11   The three conditions set out by Lord Diplock should not be misunderstood. His Lordship did not say, nor do I take any of their Honours who have adopted the passage to suggest, that whenever the three conditions are satisfied, a court is at liberty to supply the omission of the legislature. Rather, his Lordship was saying that in the absence of any one of the three conditions, the court cannot construe a statute with the effect that certain words appear in the statute. 12   As I understand the recent cases, they are not authority for the proposition that a court is entitled, upon satisfaction of the three conditions postulated by Lord Diplock, to perfect the Parliamentary intention by inserting words in a statute. The court may construe words in the statute to apply to a particular situation or to operate in a particular way, even if the words used would not, on a literal construction, so apply or operate. However, the words which actually appear in the statute must be reasonably open to such a construction. Construction must be text based. 
     
      
    13   The contemporary approach to construction is well described as ‘literal in total context’ (E Dreidger Construction of Statutes (2nd ed, 1983) p2). See eg CIC Insurances Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1995-97) 187 CLR 384 at 408; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority  (1998) 153 ALR 490; 72 ALJR 841 at [69]. The courts no longer “make a fortress out of the dictionary” (Cabell v Markham 148 F2d 737 (1945) at 739 per Learned Hand J. 
     
      
    14   Putting to one side obvious typographical errors (see Bennion Statutory Interpretation (3rd ed, 1997) pp675-677), the court supplies words “omitted” by the draftsperson only in the sense that the words so included reflect in express, and therefore more readily observable, form, the true construction of the words actually used. In my opinion, the authorities do not warrant the court supplying words “omitted” by inadvertence per se. 
     
      
    15   Where the words actually used are not reasonably capable of being construed in the manner contended for, they will not be so construed. (McAlister (1990) 169 CLR 324 at 330; R v Di Maria (1996) 67 SASR 466 at 472-474). If a court can construe the words actually used by the Parliament to carry into effect the Parliamentary intention, it will do so notwithstanding that the specific construction is not the literal construction and even if it is a strained construction. The process of construction will, for example, sometimes cause the court to read down general words, or to give the words used an ambulatory operation. So long as the Court confines itself to the range of possible meanings or of operation of the text - using consequences to determine which meaning should be selected - then the process remains one of construction. 
     
      
    16   The construction reached in this way will often be more clearly expressed by way of the addition of words to the words actually used in the legislation. The references in the authorities to the court ‘supplying omitted words’ should be understood as a means of expressing the court’s conclusion with clarity, rather than as a description of the actual reasoning process which the court has conducted. In all cases, what the court has done is to construe the words actually used in their total context. When the authorities are so understood, the additional words proposed in the present case are plainly impermissible. 
     
      
    17   The basic Australian authority on legislative inadvertence is Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v FCT (1981) 147 CLR 297. The statutory provision under consideration was to the effect that references in another section to a “company” apply in relation to a holding company, as if they were references to the holding company. Some of the references to a “company” in the other section, so applied, made perfect sense. If the reference in the particular paragraph under consideration was so applied, the effect of doing so was variously described as “incongruous” (Gibbs CJ at 305), “an anachronism” (Stephen J at 311) and “capricious and irrational” (Mason and Wilson JJ at 321). The legislative history of the provision indicated that the draftsperson had made a mistake. 
     
      
    18   This case has been explained as “in effect” reading words into the statute (Pearce & Geddes Statutory Interpretation in Australia (4th ed, 1996) par 2.16). I would not so describe it. What the court concluded was that in a particular paragraph, the word “company” would not be given the extended meaning which a subsection said that all such references should be given. In the full context of all the relevant provisions and of the legislative history - ‘literal in total context’ - the subsection which made provision for the extended meaning was read down so as not to apply to the specific reference in the paragraph. 
     
      
    19   As Deane J put it in the Full Federal Court, the effect of the construction was the same as if the words “where appropriate” had been introduced into the subsection. However, his Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
        “The implication of words such as ‘where appropriate’, in a legislative direction to substitute words in another legislative provision so as to apply that legislative provision to circumstances to which it would not otherwise be applicable, does not involve doing violence to the words which Parliament has used. Where, as in the present case, the direction to substitute the different words is given in respect of a variety of different legislative provisions, the implication can be made almost as readily as can the implication of the qualification ‘subject to a contrary intention’ in a definition section”. ( 
        FCT v Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd 
         (1979) 25 ALR 511 at 516) 
        
       
      
    20   In the Full Federal Court, Brennan J reached the same result by reading down the special application of the word “company”, so as to relate only to those references in the previous sections to a company which was enabled to take into account losses and not to a different kind of reference. It was Brennan J’s formulation which found favour in the High Court. (See at 322 per Mason and Wilson JJ, 313 per Stephen J). 
     
      
    21   The terminology of Deane J - “implying” the words “where appropriate” - does, in my opinion, represent a construction of the words actually used. It does not differ from the reasoning of Brennan J, adopted by the High Court. However, the construction is given clear expression by the process which Deane J describes as ‘implication’, involving the ‘addition’ of words. Nevertheless, words are not inserted to perfect the intention of Parliament. The actual words are construed to conform with the intention, where they may reasonably be so construed. 
     
      
    22   Cooper-Brookes is not, in my opinion, authority for reading words into a statute. It is a case in which words of general application were read down. 
     
      
    23   The Barons of the Court of the Exchequer said as long ago as 1660: 
     
      
       
        
        “And the judges of the law in all times past have so far pursued the intent of the makers of statutes that they have expounded Acts which were general in words to be but particular where the intent was particular”. ( 
        Stradling v Morgan 
         (1660) 75 ER 305 at 312, see also at 315) 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    24   As Lord Simon of Glaisdale has put it: 
     
      
       
        
        “Words and phrases of the English language have an extraordinary range of meaning. This has been a rich resource in English poetry (which makes fruitful use of the resonances, overtones and ambiguities), but it has a concomitant disadvantage in English law (which seeks unambiguous precision, with the aim that every citizen shall know, as exactly as possible, where he stands under the law”. ( 
        Stock v Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd  
        [1978] 1 WLR 231 at 236) 
        
       
       
      His Lordship has described the process as one of identifying the draftsperson’s “linguistic register” ( 
      Maunsell v Olins 
       [1975] AC 373 at 291;  
      Farrell v Alexander 
       [1977] AC 59 at 84;  
      Black-Clawson International Ltd 
       supra at 645).  
       
      
    25   The process of reading down general words is a well established means of construction. (See eg Bowtell v Goldsborough Mort & Co. Ltd (1906) 3 CLR 444 at 456-457; Ex parte Walsh & Johnson; In re Yates (1925) 37 CLR 36 at 91-93; R v Wilson; Ex parte Kisch (1934) 53 CLR 234 at 244; Church of the Holy Trinity v United States 143 US 457 (1982) at 459; Tokyo Mart at 279; Smith v East Elloe Rural District Council [1956] AC 736 at 764-765; Bropho supra at 17-18. See my address “Statutory Interpretation: Identifying the Linguistic Register”, the Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture at the University of Newcastle, 23 March 1999 to be published in the Newcastle University Law Review). 
     
      
    26   In Tokyo-Mart the regulation which fell to be construed was in this form: 
     
      
       
        
        “The concentration of metal in a food …in the case of food in a dried …form, shall be determined with respect to the mass of the food after dilution”. 
        
       
      
    27   On a literal construction this would extend to all cases of food in a dried form, irrespective of whether it was usually, or ever, consumed in a diluted form. The court read down the generality of the words. 
     
      
    28   The language of the regulation itself, employed general words, eg “dilution”, “reconstitution”, which indicated that “the draftsman intended that (the regulation) would be filled out and extended according to implications and unexpressed assumptions” (282E). 
     
      
    29   Mahoney JA, with whom McHugh and Clarke JJA agreed, after quoting Lord Diplock from Wentworth Securities v Jones [1980] AC 74, referred to the court supplying “omitted words”, without identifying any such words. Throughout, however, his Honour emphasised that what was involved was a process of construction (eg 282G, 283B). The “omitted words” were, as I understand his Honour’s reasoning, words which would indicate in an express form, that the actual text which employed words of apparently general application had to be construed in a more restrictive way. 
     
      
    30   In Bermingham supra, the Court was concerned with a statute making provision for the transfer of prisoners between States. The section in issue allowed credit for remissions in the transferee State, to which a prisoner would have been eligible in the transferor State. In that case the transferred prisoner had earned remissions from the minimum term of imprisonment. (Then still referred to in New South Wales as a non-parole period). The relevant provision referred to “any remission of his sentence of imprisonment”. The issue before the court was whether this applied only to the head sentence or whether it also applied to the minimum term. The difficulty arose because the relevant subsection was premised on the application of another section which dealt only with head sentences. 
     
      
    31   One purpose of the Act was to ensure that prisoners were not disadvantaged after transfer. The words “sentence of imprisonment” were construed to encompass both the minimum term and the head sentence (299B-C; 300C). Although the court used the language of making good an “omission”, referring to Tokyo-Mart, it emphasised that what it was doing was construing the words actually used - “sentence of imprisonment” - so that they included the “minimum term” (299D, 300C). This gave an ambulatory operation to the actual text. 
     
      
    32   The two techniques of construction to which I have referred - reading down general words and giving words an ambulatory construction - are based on the text. In my opinion, there is no warrant for supplying omitted words, unless the result of some such recognised technique of construction can be so described. 
     
      
    33   It is not, in my opinion, appropriate to take an expression of intention from extrinsic materials to supply the omission by the draftsperson, when the result cannot reasonably be deduced from the words actually used by a recognised technique of construction. 
     
      
    34   As McHugh J has put it: 
     
      
       
        
        “Extrinsic material cannot be used to construe a legislative provision unless the construction of the material is ‘reasonably open’ ( 
        CIC Insurance Ltd 
         (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408). Even if extrinsic material convincingly indicates the evil at which a section was aimed, it does not follow that the language of the section will always permit a construction that will remedy that evil. If the legislature uses language which covers only one state of affairs, a court cannot legitimately construe the words of the section in a tortured and unrealistic manner to cover another set of circumstances”. ( 
        Newcastle City Council v GIO 
          
        General Ltd 
         at 113) 
        
       
      
    35   The clearest example of this approach is R v Bolton; Ex parte Beane. The issue in that case was whether a statutory provision concerned with “visiting forces” applied to deserters from the armed forces of the United States. Mason CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the second reading speech by the Minister … quite unambiguously asserts that Part III relates to deserters and absentees whether or not they are from a visiting force. But this of itself, while deserving serious consideration, cannot be determinative; it is valuable as an aid to interpretation. The words of a Minister must not be substituted for the text of the law. Particularly is this so when the intention stated by the Minister but unexpressed in the law is restrictive of the liberty of the individual. It is always possible that through oversight or inadvertence the clear intention of the Parliament fails to be translated into the text of the law. However unfortunate it may be when that happens, the task of the court remains clear. The function of the court is to give effect to the will of Parliament as expressed in the law”. (518) 
        
       
      
    36   In the present case, the various references to subpoenas in the extrinsic materials, set out in the judgment of James J, are in the same position as the unambiguous assertion of the Minister considered in R v Bolton; Ex parte Beane.  
     
      
    37   The areas of operation of the two subject matters - ancillary processes and evidence - overlap but are not coextensive. They are, accordingly, distinct for relevant purposes. The words of the statute cannot, in my opinion, be strained to remedy the alleged mistake by Parliament. The words “adduced in evidence” cannot reasonably be extended to embrace production pursuant to a subpoena. “[T]his is a field upon which the Evidence Act does not enter.” Northern Territory of Australia v GPAO (1999) HCA 8 at [17] and see [135, 199, 254]. 
     
      
       
      Derivative Application 
       
      
    38   In R v N, NSWCCA 21 July 1998, it appears from my judgment that: 
     
      
       
        
        “When the matter came on for hearing today the effect of his Honour’s application of the decision in  
        Telstra Corporation v Australis Media Holdings 
         (1997) 41 NSWLR 147 was acknowledged to be superseded by the introduction in the District Court Rules of Pt 29 r1 …”. 
        
       
      
    39   It is clear that Part 29 relates only to civil cases. Accordingly, the reasoning in R v N should be regarded as per incuriam. 
     
      
    40   I agree with James J that, in this regard, R v N is wrong. 
     
      
    41   Subpoenas in a criminal case must serve a legitimate forensic purpose. Whether or not a document may be adduced in evidence does not exhaust the list of such purposes. (See eg Waind v Hill (1978) 1 NSWLR 377 at 381D-385D; Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 22). 
     
      
    42   Stated at this level of generality, the common law rule is not affected by the Evidence Act 1995. A change in what is admissible in evidence will, of course, reduce the list of legitimate purposes. But admissibility does not exhaust the list.  
     
      
    43   In this case all parties accepted that, notwithstanding the extraordinarily broad terms of the subpoenas, the appellant had established a legitimate forensic purpose. The precise nature of that purpose was not specifically identified, despite the clear line of authority that it should be. (Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 18; Carroll v Attorney-General (NSW) (1993) 70 ACrimR 162 at 181-182; Attorney General (NSW) v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 at 690; Registrar v Tastan (1994) 75 ACrimR 498 at 504-505). 
     
      
    44   In M v L (1999) 1 NZLR 747, the New Zealand Court of Appeal considered a claim for privilege of notes made by doctors and counsellors of sexual assault victims who, as plaintiffs, had discovered the notes as being within their power. Rule 307 of the High Court Rules provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the Court may, unless the document is privileged from production, order that party … to produce the document for inspection …” 
        
       
      
    45   Section 35 of the Evidence Amendment Act (No 2) 1980 (NZ) provided that the Court could in its discretion excuse a witness from answering a question or producing a document on the grounds of breach of confidence. The Court of Appeal held that the section only applied to witnesses. It did not apply to pre-trial discovery. However, the Court gave the section a derivative application in determining how the discretion under Rule 307 should be exercised (M v L at 762). 
     
      
    46   M v L is of little assistance in the present case. The identification of a “legitimate forensic purpose”, does not involve the exercise of a discretion by the Court. Issues of judgment will arise in the context of assessing the propounded legitimate forensic purpose. However, such issues were precluded in the present case by the express concession on this point. Issues which may have been considered in terms of “legitimacy” of purpose were, by reason of the concession, treated as part of the balancing process. In view of the concession, it is not appropriate for this Court to consider the issue of legitimate purpose as it appears on the materials before the Court. 
     
      
    47   On 14 May 1999, the High Court of Australia gave special leave in the case of Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1998) 159 ALR 664. The issue that has divided the courts for some years concerning the derivative application of the Evidence Act (1995) will now be authoritatively determined. 
     
      
    48   In Akins v Abigroup Ltd (1998) 43 NSWLR 539 the Court of Appeal held that such derivative application was appropriate, in part in order to follow the Full Federal Court in Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd v Spalvins (1998) 81 FCR 360 (Akins at 547). In Esso Australia, by majority, the Full Federal Court overruled Adelaide Steamship v Spalvins. The Court of Appeal has refused leave to reopen Akins v Abigroup (Amalgamated Televisions Services Pty Ltd v Marsden [1999] NSWCA 97 at [13]). 
     
      
    49   This Court is not technically bound by decisions of the Court of Appeal. (See Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 472; Hookham (1993) 31 NSWLR 381 at 390-391). However, this Court is comprised of members of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, including members of the Court of Appeal. It should generally treat judgments of the Court of Appeal as if they were judgments of this Court. The circumstances in which this Court will depart from its own decisions are limited. (See Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 214). 
     
      
    50   The earlier authorities on derivative use are concerned with legal professional privilege. They do not purport to lay down a general rule that whenever the Evidence Act restricts the tender of a document, there is a corresponding restriction on ancillary processes. 
     
      
    51   Specifically, Akins v Abigroup does not determine the present case. In that case, the first reason given by Mason P for a derivative application was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The doctrine of legal professional privilege is more than a rule of evidence. It is a fundamental common law doctrine that furthers the rule of law”. (546) 
        
       
      
    52   There is no equivalent to this proposition applicable to a “protected confidence” within s126H. There is no “common law doctrine” with respect to such matters at all. In this context the “derivative use” argument can only be an argument for accepting “protected confidences” as falling within the scope of public interest immunity or for creating a new category of privilege. 
     
      
       
      Public Interest Immunity 
       
      
    53   Public interest immunity is a field which has been plagued with terminological confusion. The use of “Crown privilege” has been abandoned. The confusion has not diminished. The words “public interest immunity” are sometimes treated as if they extended to any circumstance in which exclusion should be supported on the grounds of public policy - and in that sense involve a ‘public interest’. They were so treated in the submissions in this case. The terminology of “public interest” should not be permitted to extend the basis of the doctrine. 
     
      
    54   “Public interest immunity” is concerned with, and the terminology should be confined to, the conduct of governmental functions. Section 130 of the Evidence Act 1995 reflects this proposition by use of the formula: “that relates to matters of state”.  
     
      
    55   The ‘public interest’, to which this immunity refers, requires a dimension that is governmental in character. The references to “public interest” in the frequently cited passages from the case law, should be so understood (eg Sankey v Whitlam (1979-80) 142 CLR 1 at 38-39, Alister v R (1983-84) 143 CLR 404 at 412). These passages did not intend to encompass every situation in which it could be said that some form of public policy could be served by non-disclosure. In my opinion, it is not correct to treat public interest immunity as if it were a “residual category” of circumstances in which courts limit access to information on the basis of weighing the public interest in disclosure against any factor that can be described as a “public interest”. (As does Ligertwood Australian Evidence (3rd ed, (1998) paras 5.96, 5.104; c/f Cross on Evidence (5th Australian ed. 996) paras 27030, 27055, 27080). 
     
      
    56   The references in the case law to the proposition that the categories of public interest are not closed, need to be similarly confined. (See D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children [1978] AC 171 at 230; Sankey v Whitlam at 60; Rogers v Home Secretary (1973) AC 388 at 412F; R v Chief Constable of West Midlands Police; Ex parte Wiley [1995] 1 AC 274 at 305). Such references should be understood in the sense identified by Mason J in Australian National Airlines Commission v The Commonwealth (1975) 132 CLR 582 at 591. His Honour referred to what was then still called “Crown privilege” and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “…it would be an error to regard the categories of documents which attract privilege as necessarily closed. As time passes it is inevitable that new classes of documents  
        important to the working of government 
         will come into existence and that detriment to the public interest may occur in circumstances which cannot presently be foreseen”. (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    57   Public interest immunity arises because of “the need to safeguard the proper functioning of the executive arm of government and of the public service”(emphasis added), to use the formulation which Stephen J in Sankey v Whitlam at 56 described as “the reasons customarily given” for the immunity. This formulation was adopted by Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1992-93) 176 CLR 604 at 619, and described by their Honours as “the ordinary reasons supporting a claim for public service immunity”. 
     
      
    58   The dividing line between private and public interests is not always easy to draw. Public institutions - relevantly, in the present case, hospitals - provide private services, indistinguishable from the same services provided by private institutions. On the other hand, significant schemes of public regulation are conducted by private institutions, increasingly so over recent years. 
     
      
    59   Similar issues have arisen in the sphere of administrative law, in order to determine whether particular organisations are subject to judicial review on the basis of public law doctrines, such as denial of natural justice. (See the authorities discussed in Aronson and Dyer Judicial Review of Administrative Action (1996) pp130-138. I have referred to these issues in my address “Foundations of Administrative Law”, the 1998 R.N. Spann Oration published in (1999) 58 Aust. J. Public Administration 3, and (1999) 4 The Judicial Review 69). 
     
      
    60   The same difficulty of identifying a boundary arises with claims of public interest immunity. The identity of the organisation is not decisive, as was clearly established in D v NSPCC, to which Beazley JA makes detailed reference. In that case the public regulatory role of the private association was clearly established. After referring to the police informer category, Lord Hailsham LC added: 
     
      
       
        
        “Once, however, it is accepted that information given to the police in the instant case would have been protected, it becomes, in my judgment, manifestly absurd that it should not be accorded equally to the same information if given by the same informant to the local authority (who would have been under a duty to act on it) or to the appellant society, to whom, according to the undisputed evidence, ordinary informants more readily resort …. 
        
       
       
        
        But the police, the local authority and the society stand on the same footing. The public interest is identical in relation to each”. (229-230); see also at 219A-C, F per Lord Diplock and 241F per Lord Simon of Glaisdale.) 
        
       
      
    61   Although there are other strands in the reasoning, this was the decisive consideration. Nothing in D v NSPCC qualifies the emphasis on the significance of the public element as set forth in Marks v Beyfus (1890) 25 QBD 494 especially at 496.10-497.3 and 498.3. (See Science Research Council v Nassé [1980] AC 1028 at 1087-1088; Eagles “Evidentiary Protection for Informers - Policy or Privilege” (1982) 6 Crim LJ 175 at 180-184). The expansive remarks of Lord Edmund Davies in D v NSPCC at 245 have not been adopted. 
     
      
    62   An example of the application of this proposition is that professional disciplinary bodies have been found to fall within the scope of public interest immunity. This is because these private bodies, in the relevant respect, perform a governmental - indeed generally statutory - function. (See Borg v Barnes (1987) 10 NSWLR 734; Law Institute of Victoria v Irving [1990] VR 611; Legal Services Commission v Trotter (1990) 54 SASR 74; Finch v Grieve (1991) 22 NSWLR 528).  
     
      
    63   To similar effect is the reasoning - although differing in its application to the specific statutory scheme - of Bowen CJ and Toohey J with respect to Aboriginal information supplied to the Sacred Sites Authority. (See Aboriginal Sacred Sites Authority v Maurice (1986) 20 FCR 104 at 109-110, 129-130; c/f 114-115 per Woodward J who took the broader approach). 
     
      
    64   In his judgment, Freeman DCJ, in the alternative to the derivative application of Division 1B, accepted the public interest immunity claim in the present case. His Honour appears to have accepted the submission put to him that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The interest … is a matter touching the governance of New South Wales in that it is necessary to protect confidentiality in order to ensure that the business of the Department of Health can successfully be conducted”. 
        
       
      
    65   The “business of the Department of Health” to which reference is made, consists of the provision of sexual counselling services to individuals. This is not governmental in character, even if it is supplied by a public institution. In submissions to this Court, counsel for the Health Service expressly abjured the proposition that the privilege was restricted to governmental health services. In this regard the submissions on appeal appear to differ from those before Freeman DCJ. On this approach, in my opinion, the issue is whether a new category of privilege should be created, not whether public interest immunity applies. 
     
      
    66   The evidence in support of this matter is set out in para 10 of Dr MacGregor’s affidavit, quoted in James J’s judgment. This focussed on the detriment to the “public interest” from discouraging sexual assault victims “endeavouring to rehabilitate themselves”. This detriment does not fall within public interest immunity. It can be protected, if at all, only by creating a new category of privilege. 
     
      
    67   The only governmental public interest suggested by Dr MacGregor was that sexual assault victims may be discouraged “possibly from reporting sexual assaults”. The mechanism for this link was not specified with any precision. The use of the qualification “possibly” deprives the argument of force, even if Dr MacGregor’s opinion on such matters were entitled to weight. There is no evidence before the Court which suggests that this effect, if any, is of sufficient significance to warrant its acceptance as an impediment to the administration of justice. 
     
      
    68   Subsequently to completing the above analysis, I have read the judgment of Beazley JA. Her Honour refers to an article by Cossins and Pilkington “Balancing the Scales” (1996) UNSWLJ 222, particularly an extract from comments by an employee of the Sydney Rape Crisis Centre, quoted therein, in what is described as a personal communication with the authors of the article. I am unable to agree with her Honour that material of this character, on which the Court did not receive submissions, is able to overcome the inadequacy of the material before the Court. I refer to this inadequacy further below under the heading of Privilege. As I indicate there, no attempt was made to present to this Court in a systematic way a comprehensive and balanced body of evidence and additional material on this subject. The Court is not in a position to develop the common law with the requisite degree of confidence. 
     
      
    69   There are difficult issues involved in the formulation of public policy on these matters. On the one hand, traditional legal procedure, including criminal procedure, has been shown to have considerable inadequacies in the treatment of sexual assault victims, including their treatment as witnesses which, almost invariably, they must become. On the other hand, counselling or therapy may, in certain circumstances, distort memory in a way which, it has strongly been suggested, affects the reliability of allegations of sexual assault. I refer particularly to the debate about the recovery of repressed memory. I am not prepared to resolve such difficult issues on the basis of the materials before the Court. 
     
      
    70   In any event, there is another reason for the Courts to exercise restraint in developing the common law at this time. Parliament has been active on this very subject very recently. If, as appears likely, Parliament did intend to extend Division 1B to ancillary processes, the defect can be very easily remedied. Furthermore, the precise formulation adopted in s126H employs concepts such as “substantial probative value” and “substantially outweighed by”, which pose a different inquiry from that involved in a public interest immunity balancing exercise. This is a matter which should be left to Parliament to resolve. 
     
      
    71   I note that in the present case, Freeman DCJ applied what he called “the calculus required in s126H3”, namely the test of “substantial probative value”. This was based on his Honour’s acceptance of the derivative application argument. His Honour did not undertake the less stringent balancing exercise required for public interest immunity. 
     
      
       
      Privilege 
       
      
    72   All claims of privilege operate as a fetter on the discovery of truth. This is of particular significance where, as here, the liberty of the subject is at stake. 
     
      
    73   As Knight Bruce VC said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The discovery and vindication and establishment of truth are main purposes certainly of the existence of Courts of Justice; still, for the obtaining of these objects, which, however valuable and important, cannot be usefully pursued without moderation, cannot be either usefully or creditably pursued unfairly or gained by unfair means, not every channel is or ought to be open to them. The practical inefficacy of torture is not, I suppose, the most weighty objection to that mode of examination …Truth, like all other good things, may be loved unwisely - may be pursued too keenly - may cost too much.” ( 
        Pearse v Pearse 
         (1846) 63 ER 950 at 957). 
        
       
      
    74   It is because truth can cost too much, that legal professional privilege prevails even in the case of a subpoena issued on behalf of an accused person in criminal proceedings with respect to documents which may establish the innocence of the accused (Carter v Northmore Hale Davey and Leake (1995) 183 CLR 121). 
     
      
    75   The starting point is that the search for the truth requires all oral and documentary information, which is directly or indirectly relevant or material, to be available. As Rich J has put it: 
     
      
       
        
        “The paramount principle of public policy is that truth should always be accessible to the established courts of the country.” ( 
        McGuinness v Attorney-General (Vic) 
         (1940) 63 CLR 73 at 87). 
        
       
      
    76   However, in recognition of the fact that truth may sometimes cost too much, the common law recognises a specific list of privileges. This list has been modified by statute.  
     
      
    77   Such privileges include legal professional privilege, the privilege against self incrimination, clergy-communicant privilege, “without prejudice” privilege. (See eg McNicol Law of Privilege (1992) pp7-11; also Lord Simon of Glaisdale in D v NSPCC supra at 231-233). Each category reflects a different form of public policy and, in that sense, represents a “public interest”. However, each is a distinct category with its own disparate incidents. 
     
      
    78   As set out in Beazley JA’s judgment, a number of Australian courts have had occasion to consider the issue of communications between sexual assault victims and counsellors, generally indicating a willingness to accept the significance of the maintenance of confidentiality. (Relationships Australia v Pasternack (1996) 133 FLR 462; Howe v South Australia & Belperioi  (1998) 196 LSJ 182; R v Bull (1997) 17 SR(WA) 364. Although each of the cases refers, inappropriately in my opinion, to public interest immunity, they nevertheless contain reasoning pertinent to determining the need for a new category of privilege. (See Pasternack at 472-473; Bull at 366; Howe at 11).79   In M(A) v Ryan (1997) 143 DLR (4th) 1 the Supreme Court of Canada acknowledged a privilege in the case of a psychiatrist providing sexual assault counselling. McLachlin J delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court. Her Ladyship said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the law of privilege may evolve to reflect the social and legal realities of our time. One such reality is the laws increasing concern with the wrongs perpetrated by sexual abuse and the serious effect such abuse has on the health and productivity of the many members of our society it victimizes. Another modern reality is the extension of medical assistance from treatment of its physical effects to treatment of its mental and emotional aftermath through techniques such as psychiatric counselling.” [21] 
        
       
      
    80   Her Ladyship was applying Canadian authority which had adopted the approach propounded by Wigmore as to the circumstances in which the common law will recognise new categories of privilege, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… four fundamental conditions may be predicated as necessary to the establishment of a privilege against the disclosure of communications between persons standing in a given relation: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          1 the communications must originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2 this element of confidentiality must be essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the relation between the parties; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3 the relation must be one which in the opinion of the community ought to be sedulously fostered; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          4 the injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure of the communications must be greater than the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation. 
          
         
         
        These four conditions being present, a privilege should be recognised; and not otherwise.” ( 
        Wigmore on Evidence 
         (3rd ed, 1961) vol 8 para 2285). 
        
       
      
    81   These four conditions had been adopted, in terms, in earlier decisions of the Canadian Supreme Court to which her Ladyship referred (Slavutych v Baker (1975) 55 DLR (3rd) 224 at 228; R v Gruenke (1991) 3 SCR 263 (SCC) at 286. In the latter case, the Supreme Court was at pains to say that the Wigmore criteria were not “carved in stone” but provided a “general framework within which policy considerations and the requirements of fact finding can be weighed and balanced on the basis of their relative importance in the particular case before the court.” (at 290)) 
     
      
    82   In M(A) v Ryan, McLachlin J went through each of the four criteria and indicated how they were satisfied in the case of sexual assault communications [25-29]. Of significance to the outcome of the case was the reference by her Ladyship to the developing case law under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, specifically the right to privacy [21-23 and 30]. 
     
      
    83   With respect to Wigmore’s second and third criteria, McLachlin J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second requirement - that the element of confidentiality be essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the relation between the parties to the communication - is clearly satisfied in the case at bar … Confidentiality is essential to the continued existence and effectiveness of the therapeutic relations between a psychiatrist and a patient seeking treatment for the psychiatric harm resulting from sexual abuse. Once psychiatrist-patient confidentiality is broken and the psychiatrist becomes involved in the patient’s external world the ‘frame’ of the therapy is broken. At that point, it is Dr Parker’s practice to discontinue psychotherapy with the patients. The result is both confusing and damaging to the patient. At a time when she would normally find support in the therapeutic relationship, as during the trial, she finds herself without support. In the result, the patient’s treatment may cease, her distrust must be exacerbated, and her personal and work relations be adversely affected. 
        
       
       
        
        ……… 
        
       
       
        
        The third requirement - that the relation must be one which in the opinion of the community ought to be sedulously fostered - is equally satisfied. Victims of sexual abuse often suffer serious trauma, which, left untreated, may mar their entire lives. It is widely accepted that it is in the interests of the victim in society that such help be obtained. The mental health of the citizen, no less than its physical health, is a public good of great importance. Just as it is in the interest of sexual abuse victim to be restored to full and healthy functioning, so is it in the interest of the public that she take her place as a healthy and productive member of society.” [25 and 27] 
        
       
      
    84   Some of this reasoning is based on evidence which is not replicated in the evidence before the Court. Nevertheless, the passages quoted contain reasons appropriate to be considered in determining whether a similar privilege should be acknowledged in Australia. However, I am of the opinion that the approach to determining these matters, propounded by Wigmore and adopted in Canada, is not open to an intermediate court of appeal in Australia.  
     
      
    85   The position in Australia with respect to the recognition of new categories of privilege is, in my opinion, as set forth by Sir Owen Dixon in McGuinness v The Attorney General of Victoria (1939-40) 63 CLR 73 at 102-103 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the law was faced at a comparatively early stage of the growth of the rules of evidence with a question how to resolve the inevitable conflict between a necessity of discovering the truth in the interests of justice on the one hand and on the other the obligation of secrecy or confidence which an individual called upon to testify may in good faith have undertaken to a party or other person.  
        Except in a few relations 
         where paramount considerations of general policy appeared to require that there should be a special privilege, such as husband and wife, attorney and client, communications between jurors, the councils of the Crown and State secrets, and by statute, physician and patient and priest and penitent,  
        an inflexible rule was established that no obligation of honour, no duties of non-disclosure arising from the nature of a pursuit or calling, could stand in the way of the imperative necessity of revealing the truth in the witness box 
        . Claims have been made from time to time for the protection of confidences to trustees, agents, bankers, and clerks, amongst others, and they have all been rejected.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    86   It is well established that confidentiality is not, of itself, a separate category of immunity: D v NSPCC at 218A-G, 230D, 237F-G, 239A, 242D; McGuinness at 102-103; Sankey v Whitlam supra at 42-43). 
     
      
    87   The common law has accepted that particular relationships of confidence are of such significance that they should be recognised in this way. The common law rule forbidding spouses from testifying for or against each other was of that character. There was some confusion between compellability and privilege in this regard. (See eg McNicholl supra chapter 4). 
     
      
    88   However, the common law refused to afford privilege to exceptional sensitive confidential relationships. To many people, even in this secular age, and to the overwhelming majority of people in times past, there was no more intimate or personal communication than that which occurred with a priest. No such privilege was recognised until statutory modification. (See Wilson v Rastall (1792) 100 ER 1283 at 1286-1287; Normanshaw v Normanshaw and Measham (1893) 69 LT 468; McNicholl supra chapter 5). 
     
      
    89   Similarly, the doctor/patient, including psychiatrist/patient, relationship was not acknowledged, despite the level of intimacy often involved. Dutchess of Kingston’s Case (1771-1777) 20 St Tr 355 at 572-573; Wilton v Rastall (1792) 4 Term Rep 753 at 759-760; Broed v Pitt (1823) 3 CCP 518 at 579; Greennough v Gaskell (1833) 1 My & K; (1833) 39 ER 618 at 620-621; Greenlaw v King (1838) 1 Beav 137 at 145, Russell v Jackson (1851) 68 ER 558 at 559-560; Wheeler v Le Marchant [1881] 17 ChD 675 at 681; R v Gibbons (1823) 1 C & P 97; Garner v Garner (1920) 36 TLR 196 at 197; Nuttall v Nuttall and Tuyman (1964) 108 SolJ 605; McNicholl supra chapter 5). 
     
      
    90   It is on the basis of authorities of this character that, by a process of induction, Dixon J stated the common law rule. The application of that rule determined the specific case of a claim for privilege for journalist sources. (McGuinness supra at 102-105; John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Cojuango  (1988) 165 CLR 346 at 354-356). However, his Honour’s reasoning was not confined to this category. 
     
      
    91   His Honour referred to an “inflexible rule … that no obligation of honour, no duties of non disclosure … could stand in the way … of revealing the truth”. The specific instance of a journalist’s source was derived by a process of deduction from a general common law rule. His Honour’s statement of that rule is formulated at a level of generality which would determine the present case. The reasoning of Dixon J is not, in terms, replicated in the other judgments in McGuinness. However, it does represent, in my opinion, the common law in Australia. An intermediate appellate court should be slow to develop a new category of privilege. It is not, I believe, open to such a court to approach this issue on the basis of the Wigmore test as adopted in Canada. 
     
      
    92   In any event, this is not an appropriate occasion on which to establish this new category of privilege. First, it has not been demonstrated that the privilege propounded has attained the requisite level of community acceptance, as a special case entitling treatment that differs from other confidential relationships. Secondly, the evidentiary material presented to the Court is much too limited to take such a significant step. 
     
      
    93   The recognition of a new category of privilege requires the formulation of public policy by the courts, within the confines of the proper role of the courts. It is only appropriate for the courts to recognise a category of public policy which is capable of precise statement, and which reflects so widely held an opinion, that the Court’s reasoning can be described in terms of ‘recognition’ rather than ‘creation’. 
     
      
    94   As Sir Isaac Isaacs said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The ‘public policy’ which a court is entitled to apply as a test of validity to a contract is in relation to some definite and governing principle which the community as a whole has already adopted either formally by law or tacitly by its general course of corporate life, and which the courts of the country can therefore recognise and enforce. The court is not a legislator: it cannot initiate the principle; it can only state or formulate it if it already exists:”  
        Wilkinson v Osborne 
         (1915) 21 CLR 89 at 97. 
        
       
      
    95   As Sir Frederick Jordan said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the phrase ‘public policy’ appears to mean the ideas which for the time being prevail in a community as to the conditions necessary to ensure its welfare; so that anything is treated as against public policy if it is generally regarded as injurious to the public interest.” 
        
       
      
    96   His Honour then set out the passage from Wilkinson v Osborne I have quoted and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is well settled that a contract is not enforceable if its enforcement would be opposed to public policy:  
        Mogul Steamship Company v McGregor, Gow & Co 
         [1892] AC 25 at 39, 51. Public policy is not, however, fixed and stable. From generation to generation ideas change as to what is necessary or injurious, so that ‘public policy’ is a variable thing. It must fluctuate with the circumstances of the time’:  
        Naylor, Benzon & Co v Krainische Industrie Gesellschaft 
         [1918] 1 KB 331 at 342. New heads of public policy come into being, and old heads undergo modification.”  
        
       
       
      ( 
      In Re Jacob Morris 
       (1943) 43 SR(NSW) 352 at 355-356). 
       
      
    97   The passage from Jordan CJ was cited with approval by Mason J in A v Hayden (1984) 156 CLR 532 at 558. At p571 Wilson and Dawson JJ cited with approval the passage of Isaacs J from Wilkinson v Osborne. 
     
      
    98   In my opinion, an analogous test applies when the Court is called upon to modify the common law by recognising a new category of privilege. The Court should not recognise a new category of privilege unless it represents a definite principle which the community as a whole has plainly adopted, for a significantly lengthy period to suggest permanence. 
     
      
    99   In Dietrich v R (1992) 177 CLR 292, Brennan J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The common law has been created by the courts and the genius of the common law system consists in the ability of the courts to mould the law to correspond with the contemporary values of society.” (319) 
        
       
       
      His Honour went on to say: 
       
       
        
        “The contemporary values which justify judicial development of the law are not the transient notions which emerge in reaction to a particular event or which are inspired by a publicity campaign conducted by an interest group. They are the relatively permanent values of the Australian community. Even if the perception of contemporary values is coloured by the opinions of individual judges, judicial experience in the practical application of legal principles and the coincidence of judicial opinions in appellate courts provide some assurance that those values are correctly perceived.” (319) 
        
       
      
    100   In Breen v Williams (1995-96) 186 CLR 71 at 115, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, in the course of rejecting the development of the common law to establish a patient’s right of access to medical records, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Advances in the common law must begin from a baseline of accepted principle and proceed by conventional methods of legal reasoning. Judges have no authority to invent legal doctrine that distorts or does not extend or modify accepted legal rules and principles. Any changes in legal doctrine brought about by judicial creativity, must ‘fit’ within the body of accepted rules and principles. The judges of Australia cannot, so to speak, ‘make it up’ as they go along. It is a serious constitutional mistake to think that the common law courts have authority to ‘provide a solvent’ ( 
        Tucker v US Department of Commerce 
         (1992) 958 F 2d 1411 at 1413) for every social, political or economic problem. The role of the common law is a far more modest one.” 
        
       
      
    101   The contemporary Australian debate on the permissible scope of judicial development of the common law, finds its origin in a seminal article by his Honour Justice McHugh, “The Law Making Function of the Judicial Process” (1988) 62 ALJ 15. His Honour has summarised subsequent literature in “The Judicial Method” (1999) 73 ALJ 37. 
     
      
    102   There have been substantial changes in community attitudes to sexual assault victims over recent decades. Both legislative and judicial change has occurred in the conduct of legal proceedings involving allegations of sexual assault. With respect to sexual counselling records, it is not clear to me that this process has yet reached a stage where it can be said that it is sufficiently definite, widely accepted and permanent, for the purpose of recognising, as distinct from creating, a new category of privilege. 
     
      
    103   The Court was referred to the Second Reading Speech of the Honourable J W Shaw QC, Attorney General for New South Wales, for the Evidence Amendment (Confidential Communications) Act 1997, which inserted Division 1B into the Evidence Act  1995. 
     
      
    104   This speech indicates some of the reasons why publication of communications of this character may have adverse consequences. The use which this Court can make of arguments put in parliamentary debate is extremely limited. Of itself it is not sufficient for the purpose of changing a public policy pursuant to the approach I have adumbrated above. The same is true of the legislation in this State and Victoria, and the bill in South Australia as set out in the judgment of Beazley JA. The legislation does not yet indicate the level of national unanimity that is required. 
     
      
    105   Indeed, when determining whether or not the common law should, for the first time, recognise a new category of privilege, the extent and recency of detailed consideration by Parliament given to the very matters suggested is relevant. Where Parliament has shown itself prepared to intervene, the Courts should be slow to rectify a perceived social ill. 
     
      
    106   Restraint is particularly appropriate where the relevant area of policy requires fine tuning of the kind required here. As I have indicated in my reasons on the subject of public interest immunity, the precise formulation of the facts and matters which could overcome the privilege set out in s126H is quite distinctive. Concepts such as “substantial probative value” and “substantially outweighed by” would not necessarily be reflected in a common law test. 
     
      
    107   This is not a case in which “it has been virtually impossible for legislatures to devote sufficient sitting time to the continual reform of the law”. (McHugh J supra 62 ALJ at 116). In such a context the courts should pursue the analogical application of statutes with greater than usual caution. 
     
      
    108   There is much to commend the approach propounded by Justice Scalia in his dissenting judgment in the United States Supreme Court, with which Chief Justice Rehnquist agreed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Effective psychotherapy undoubtedly is beneficial to individuals with mental problems, and surely serves some larger social interest in maintaining a mentally stable society. But merely mentioning these values does not answer the critical question: Are they of such importance, and is the contribution of psychotherapy to them so distinctive and is the application of normal evidentiary rules so destructive to psychotherapy, as to justify making our federal courts occasional instruments of injustice?” ( 
        Jaffee v Redmond 
         (1996) 135 L Ed 2d 337 at 352). 
        
       
      
    109   I would add, in the present context: Are communications between sexual assault victims and counsellors entitled to particular consideration, differing from other confidential relationships involving matters of personal intimacy? 
     
      
    110   The Court does not have the material which would enable it to answer these questions. It is not in a position to formulate a new public policy. 
     
      
    111   The actual evidence before the Court is limited. First, there is a brief report from a clinical psychologist concerned with the impact of disclosure on the particular complainant in this case. There is also a report from a treating doctor. Plainly this material is relevant to a balancing exercise but, other than as giving some specific examples of the possible adverse effects of disclosure, is of no assistance for the determination of a new public policy in this respect. 
     
      
    112   The substantive affidavit in this regard is that of the Deputy Director General, Operations, of the Department of Health. The relevant evidence is primarily set out in pars 8, 9 and 10 which are fully quoted in the judgment of James J.  
     
      
    113   The evidence contained in these three paragraphs is, for the purposes of establishing a new category of privilege, perfunctory. No doubt it was primarily directed to a balancing exercise in the circumstances of this case. It does not, however, reflect the depth and quality of expert opinion which the Court should have available to it in order to determine a public policy of such significance. 
     
      
    114   Affidavits in support of claims of public interest immunity have often been criticised for their amorphous quality. General conclusory assertions are not acceptable. (See eg Sankey v Whitlam supra at 96 per Mason J). 
     
      
    115   Before a new public policy is to be recognised, the supporting material would need to be of a qualitatively different order to that presented in the case. At the least, the Court would expect a systematic review of expert literature on the significance of confidentiality in the counselling relationship. The Court would also expect a review of an expert body of opinion establishing why sexual counselling services ought to be treated differently from other counselling services. In the seminal case before the United States Supreme Court, both the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association set out relevant studies in their amici curiae briefs filed with the Court. (See Jaffee v Redmond at 345 fn 9). 
     
      
    116   The Court would need to be satisfied that the material presented to the Court represented the full range of expert opinion on the relevant matters and that, where there were divergences in that expert opinion, the differences had been properly tested. The Court would also need to be satisfied that the materials before the Court covered the full range of relevant matters, and was not confined to the narrow specialisations immediately relevant, in order to overcome the possibility of special pleading that sometimes arises from a mixture of self-interest and obliviousness to considerations external to the specific field of expertise. 
     
      
    117   The submissions to the Court which sought to distinguish the case of sexual assault victims from other patient-doctor relationships, including psychiatrist/psychologist-patient relationships, were based on assertions from the bar table about the “peculiar trauma” which victims of sexual assault suffer. 
     
      
    118   The Court must treat with caution the creation of a new category of privilege which may impede the determination of truth in a particular case. This is especially so when the specific category of privilege does not appear to be capable of being restricted in the manner for which the submissions contend - in this case the restriction to communications with sexual assault victims only.  
     
      
    119   In a case in which the State of New South Wales has funded two separate legal teams to argue the case in favour of non-disclosure - the Attorney General and the Department of Health were separately represented - the Court would expect that the State would have ensured that the contrary view was also put before the Court in a systematic way. 
     
      
    120   None of this happened in this case. The material before the Court was in an exceptionally narrow compass. 
     
      
    121   It is plain that there is a considerable body of additional material that can be put before the Court. For example, the assertion that the susceptibility of communications with counsellors to exposure in legal proceedings will make it less likely for victims to obtain professional assistance, is an empirical statement capable of investigation. There are studies which suggest that no such consequence occurs to any significant degree. (See Shuman & Weiner “The Privilege Study: An Empirical Examination of the Psychotherapist-Patient Privilege” (1982) 60 North Carolina Law Review 893; Weiner & Shuman “Privilege - a Comparative Study” (1984) 12 Journal of Psychiatry and Law 373; Schuman, Weiner and Pinard “The Privilege Study (Part III): Psychotherapist-Patient Communications in Canada” (1986) 9 International Journal of Law & Psychiatry 393). 
     
      
    122   Cases which raise policy issues for the Court should not be allowed to become Law Reform Commission style inquiries. (See Davies “The Judiciary - Maintaining the Balance” in Finn (ed) Essays on Law and Government vol 1 (1995) pp283-285; Doyle “Implications of Judicial Law Making” in Saunders (ed) Courts of Final Jurisdiction: The Mason Court in Australia (1996) pp283-285; McHugh J supra 73 ALJ at 43 ff; see also my discussion in Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111 at [59-63]). However, before the Court establishes a new category of privilege it needs to be satisfied that some form of systematic attempt to marshal relevant evidence has occurred. Nothing of that character was done in the present case. 
     
      
    123   In my opinion the appeal should be allowed. I agree with the orders proposed by James J.124   BEAZLEY JA: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of James J. I agree with his Honour’s judgment save in respect of the question of whether the documents subject of the subpoena are protected from disclosure by the doctrine of public interest immunity.  
     
      
       
      Public Interest Immunity - General Principles 
       
      
    125   The principle of public interest immunity and the rules which govern its application may, in the first instance, be stated as follows. The doctrine protects from compulsory disclosure in court proceedings (and other non-curial proceedings) evidence (usually in, although not confined to, documentary form) which is or may be relevant, if its disclosure would be prejudicial or injurious to the public interest: see Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1 per Gibbs J at 38; Conway v Rimmer [1968] AC 910; Suzanne McNicol, Law of Privilege, Law Book Company, Sydney, 1992 at p 375. The principle is an exception to the primary tenet of our legal system that relevant evidence is admissible and should not be withheld: see D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children [1978] AC 171 per Lord Hailsham at 223 (‘D v NSPCC’). 
     
      
    126   Three specific rules have developed governing the application of the principle. First, the immunity cannot be waived; secondly, it is not dependent on a claim being made by the parties; thirdly, secondary evidence cannot be given of evidence the subject of the claim. The rules themselves are the defining difference between immunity and privilege. See generally McNicol, chapter 1. 
     
      
    127   Claims for immunity are traditionally categorised either as “class interest” claims - that is, documents of a class which should not be produced - or as attracting a “contents interest” - that is, a particular document the contents of which should not be produced: Duncan v Cammell, Laird & Co Limited [1942] AC 624 per Viscount Simon LC at 636. However, in Commonwealth v Northern Land Council & Anor (1993) 176 CLR 604 at 617, the distinction drawn by this dual categorisation was described as “often rough and imprecise” because it is frequently necessary for the Court, even in a class claim, to inspect a document to determine “whether it does in truth fall into a class which attracts immunity. The contents of the document may have a bearing on that question as may the topic with which it deals…”. See also Burmah Oil Co Ltd v governor & Company of the Bank of England [1980] AC 1090 at 1111-1112 per Lord Wilberforce. 
     
      
    128   It is now well established that where a claim for public interest immunity is made the court is required to balance two competing aspects of the public interest: whether the public interest would be harmed by the production of the evidence as against whether the administration of justice would be frustrated or impaired if the evidence was withheld: see Conway v Rimmer; Rogers v Home Secretary [1973] AC 388; Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs and Excise Commissioners [1974] AC 133 per Lord Denning MR at 140; Sankey v Whitlam at 38-39; Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404. In this sense, the immunity is not absolute (except perhaps in civil proceedings in respect of matters subject to current or recent Cabinet discussion: see Commonwealth v Northern Land Council). 
     
      
    129   The court is required to examine the documents itself to resolve the competing aspects of the public interest: Conway v Rimmer; Alister v The Queen. However, before the Court will engage in the balancing exercise it must be satisfied that there is a legitimate forensic purpose in having access to the evidence: Alister v The Queen; R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14. There is some difference of views in Alister as to what constitutes a legitimate forensic purpose, although the members of the court were agreed that it was something more than a mere fishing expedition. Without analysing the various viewpoints, it is sufficient for the purposes of this case to accept that there will be a legitimate forensic purpose if access to the documents may assist the case of the appellant, including for the purposes of cross-examining on credit. I have expressed the principle in these broad terms because it was conceded by the respondents, including the Crown, that the appellant had a legitimate forensic purpose in seeking access to the documents.  
     
      
    130   There are a number of recognised categories of class interest, including state secrets, cabinet minutes and evidence which would identify police informers. See discussion in Duncan v Cammell Laird & Co at 634. The overarching public interest which requires as a matter of law that such information be protected has been described as “the maintenance of social peace and order”: D v NSPCC per Lord Hailsham at 231; Attorney-General (NSW) v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 at 675. However, the rationale underlying each type of public interest immunity claim is differently expressed, depending upon the nature of the claim made.  
     
      
    131   The rationale for the doctrine of public interest immunity for government documents has been described as “the need to safeguard the proper functioning of the executive arm of government and of the public service”: Sankey v Whitlam per Stephen J at 56; see also Conway v Rimmer per Lord Reid at 952; Smith v East India Company (1841) 1 Ph 50; Home v Bentinck (1820) 2 Brod&B 130. It would be fair to say however, that the earlier cases which recognised the existence of the doctrine placed much greater weight on the need to protect the internal workings and communications of government departments and officials than would be the case today, given the trend towards the greater accountability and openness of government. This was averted to in Commonwealth v Northern Land Council, where it was said in the joint judgment at 615 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[t]he discouragement of candour on the part of public officials has been questioned as a sufficient, or even valid, basis upon which to claim immunity.” 
        
       
      
    132   The rationale underlying the immunity relating to police informers is quite different and, as with other claims for immunity, is directly related to the public interest invoked. The rationale in respect of police informers is that unless the names of informers are protected, sources of information would dry up, thus hindering the police in the detection and prevention of crime: D v NSPCC; Sankey v Whitlam; Cain v Glass (No 2) (1985) 3 NSWLR 230; Attorney General for NSW v Stuart. It is important to recognise that this rationale remains within the overarching public interest, namely “the maintenance of social peace and order”: Attorney-General (NSW) v Stuart per Hunt CJ at CL at 675; see D v NSPCC per Lord Hailsham at 231 and Lord Simon at 232. 
     
      
    133   The various circumstances in which the immunity arises demonstrate that there are many facets of the public interest within the broader public interest identified in D v NSPCC and Attorney-General (NSW) v Stuart. Nor is “the public interest” an immutable concept. Rather, it is an evolving concept which will find different expressions and emphases given changing circumstances, evolving philosophies of government and the nation state, and changing technologies. The rationale underpinning the particular public interest will correspondingly evolve.  
     
      
    134   The same is true of rationales which underpin various categories of the allied notion of privilege. This is well recognised in the case of legal professional privilege. When this privilege first emerged during the reign of Elizabeth I, its raison d’etre lay in the “oath and honour” of the attorney. It followed that the privilege was that of an attorney and not the client and was waivable by the attorney. By the early eighteenth century, the underpinning rationale had shifted. The policy foundation of the privilege was to promote the freedom of clients to consult their legal advisers by removal of the “apprehension of compelling disclosure” : 8 Wigmore, Evidence para 2290 (McNaughton rev. 1961). That remains its essential base. As the Earl of Halsbury LC said in Bullivant v Attorney-General (Vic) [1901] AC 196 at 200-201: 
     
      
       
        
        “for the perfect administration of justice, and for the protection of the confidence which exists between a solicitor and his client, it has been established as a principle of public policy that those confidential communications shall not be subject to production.” 
        
       
      
    135   Mason and Brennan JJ in Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 487 identified the rationale underlying privilege as “the furtherance of the administration of justice through the fostering of trust and candour in the relationship between lawyer and client”. See also Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney (1985) 158 CLR 500 at 532 per Dawson J; Carter v Northmore Hale Davy & Leake (1995) 183 CLR 121. 
     
      
    136   Once it is accepted that the rationale underlying a particular class or contents immunity is linked to an evolving public interest, it must follow that the circumstances in which the immunity applies may also change. This is now well accepted. However, the principles which permit or govern the development of the principle call for careful examination. I will turn to the relevant authorities shortly. Before doing so, it is convenient to understand in greater detail two categories of evidence: evidence which would disclose the identity of police informers (a category of evidence which is protected by public interest immunity); and confidential communications (which is not). These two categories are of particular relevance to the matter at issue here; the first because it was by analogy to police informers that immunity was extended in D v NSPCC, an argument which is advanced in favour of a similar extension in this case; and the second because the common law has traditionally refused to recognise confidential communications as a category of evidence which should receive the protection of privilege or immunity, which would militate against such an extension here because a significant reason advanced here for immunity was the confidential nature of the relationship. 
     
      
       
      Police Informers 
       
      
    137   The category of police informers has long been recognised as a class to which the protection of public interest immunity will be afforded. The claim can be traced back at least to the Trial of Thomas Hardy for High Treason (1794) 24 State Tr 199. Lord Chief Justice Eyre said at 808: 
     
      
       
        
        “… but there is a rule which has universally obtained on account of its importance to the public for the detection of crimes, that those persons who are the channel by means of which that detection is made, should not be unnecessarily disclosed: if it can be made appear that really and truly it is necessary to the investigation of the truth of the case that the name of the person should be disclosed, I should be very unwilling to stop it, but it does not appear to me that it is within the ordinary course to do it …” 
        
       
      
    138   This early statement of the rule established, first, that it is not necessary to prove that the informer is in danger; and secondly, that the immunity is not absolute and would not override the competing public interest of enabling an innocent person to properly establish a defence.  
     
      
    139   These rules were confirmed in Marks v Beyfus (1890) 25 QBD 494 where Lord Esher MR said at 498: 
     
      
       
        
        “this rule … was founded on grounds of public policy … I do not say it is a rule which can never be departed from; if upon the trial of a prisoner the judge should be of opinion that the disclosure of the name of the informant is necessary or right in order to shew the prisoner’s innocence, then one public policy is in conflict with another public policy, and that which says that an innocent man is not to be condemned when his innocence can be proved is the policy that must prevail. But except in that case, this rule of public policy is not a matter of discretion; it is a rule of law …” 
        
       
      
    140   Lord Diplock in D v NSPCC (at 218) explained the rationale underlying the immunity granted to protect the identity of police informers as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “If their identity were liable to be disclosed in a court of law, these sources of information would dry up and the police would be hindered in their duty of preventing and detecting crime. So the pubic interest in preserving the anonymity of police informers had to be weighed against the public interest that information which might assist a judicial tribunal to ascertain facts relevant to an issue upon which it is required to adjudicate should be withheld from that tribunal. By the uniform practice of the judges which by the time of  
        Marks v Beyfus  
        25 QBD 494 had already hardened into a rule of law, the balance has fallen upon the side of non-disclosure except where upon the trial of a defendant for a criminal offence disclosure of the identity of the informer could help to show that the defendant was innocent of the offence. In that case, and in that case only, the balance falls upon the side of disclosure.” 
        
       
      
    141   Both The Trial of Thomas Hardy and Marks v Beyfus were criminal proceedings. However, the immunity in respect of a police informer’s claim is probably an absolute one in civil cases. In Cain v Glass, McHugh JA said at 248: 
     
      
       
        
        “[u]ntil the High Court decides to the contrary, however, I think that the courts in this State should continue to apply the rule that no question of weighing competing public interests arises when a claim is made that the name of a police informer should be disclosed. The rule is absolute and is relaxed only ‘where upon the trial of a defendant for a criminal offence disclosure of the identity of the informer could help to show that the defendant was innocent of the offence’. I have stated the exception in the language of Lord Diplock in  
        D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children 
         (at 218).” 
        
       
      
    142   The public interest in maintaining social peace and order has been said to require protection of any information about continuing inquiries which, if disclosed, would be useful to those who organise criminal activities, may impede police in the pursuit of criminal activity or may prejudice future police activities: see Attorney-General (NSW) v Stuart per Hunt CJ at CL at 675 and the cases there cited. Although the need to protect the safety of informers may have played a part in the creation of the principle, the existence of a threat to the informer is not a condition precedent to its operation: D v NSPCC at 232 per Lord Simon of Glaisdale. 
     
      
       
      Confidential Communications 
       
      
    143   Confidentiality as such has not been recognised as attracting either immunity or privilege. However, in D v NSPCC Lord Hailsham at 230 stated that there were cases where confidentiality was itself a public interest. He gave as an example the case where a body was charged with the function of the enforcement and administration of the law by the initiation of court proceedings. It has also been recognised that the confidential nature of communications may be relevant to the balancing exercise which the court is required to undertake in a public interest immunity claim: Science Research Council v Nasse [1980] AC 1028. 
     
      
    144   In McGuinness v Attorney-General (Vic) (1940) 63 CLR 73 a newspaper editor, who had published articles alleging that unspecified members of Parliament had accepted bribes, refused to answer questions put by the Royal Commissioner appointed to inquire into such allegations as to the source of information upon which his information was based. On the appeal to the High Court, the editor sought to justify his refusal to answer on three bases, one of which was that an editor or journalist could never be required to disclose the source of information used to base a newspaper article. In the course of rejecting that claim Dixon J stated at 102-103: 
     
      
       
        
        “the law was faced at a comparatively early stage of the growth of the rules of evidence with the question how to resolve the inevitable conflict between the necessity of discovering the truth in the interests of justice on the one hand and on the other the obligation of secrecy or confidence which an individual called upon to testify may in good faith have undertaken to a party or other person. Except in few relations where paramount considerations of general policy appeared to require that there should be a special privilege, such as between husband and wife, attorney and client, communications between jurors, the counsels of the Crown and State secrets, and, by statute, physician and patient and priest and penitent, an inflexible rule was established that no obligation of honour, no duties of non-disclosure arising from the nature of a pursuit or calling, could stand in the way of the imperative necessity of revealing the truth in the witness box. Claims have been made from time to time for the protection of confidences to trustees, agents, bankers, and clerks, amongst others, and they have all been rejected.” 
        
       
      
    145   Dixon J also referred to the trial of the Duchess of Kingston where the Duchess’ surgeon’s claim to privilege in respect of certain of her confidences was rejected. See also Smith v East India Co; Rogers v Home Secretary. 
     
      
    146   The question of confidentiality and public interest immunity was extensively discussed in D v NSPCC. Lord Diplock said at 218: 
     
      
       
        
        “… The private promise of confidentiality must yield to the general public interest that in the administration of justice truth will out, unless by reason of the character of the information or the relationship of the recipient of the information to the informant a more important public interest is served by protecting the information or the identity of the informant from disclosure in a court of law.” 
        
       
      
    147   This passage was quoted with approval by Wood J in Finch v Grieve (1991) 22 NSWLR 5578 at 591: see below.  
     
      
    148   Lord Simon said at 230: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I do not myself think that confidentiality in itself establishes any public interest in the exclusion of relevant evidence, but rather that it may indirectly be significant where a public interest extrinsically established (for example, provision of professional legal advice or effective policing) can only be vindicated if its communications have immunity from forensic investigation.” 
        
       
      
    149   See also Lord Hailsham at 239. 
     
      
       
      Extension of Immunity 
       
      
    150   I have earlier referred to the undisputed principle that the categories of case in which immunity may be granted is not closed. It will be apparent from the above discussion that the principle will in fact operate in both directions, that is to narrow the cases in which the immunity is recognised (although in the case of the narrowing aspect, the balancing exercise also plays a role) and to broaden it. It is the principles upon which and the circumstances in which the immunity will be extended that are at issue here. The two most relevant authorities are the well known cases of Rogers v Home Secretary and D v NSPCC. 
     
      
    151   In Rogers v Home Secretary an applicant for a gaming licence sought but was refused access to a letter which had been written to the Gaming Board attacking his character. The appellant had obtained a copy of this letter, presumably through improper means. He sought to prosecute the author of the letter for criminal libel and applied for witness summonses against representatives of the Board and the Chief Constable seeking production of the letter. The Attorney-General claimed public interest immunity. The House of Lords unanimously upheld the claim. Lord Reid at 400 identified as the issue before the court: 
     
      
       
        
        “… whether the public interest requires that the letter shall not be produced and whether that public interest is so strong as to override the ordinary right and interest of a litigant that he shall be able to lay before a court of justice all relevant evidence.” 
        
       
      
    152   Categorising the claim as a class claim, his Lordship continued at 400: 
     
      
       
        
        “[t]he claim in the present case is not based on the nature of the contents of this particular letter. It is based on the fact that the board cannot adequately perform their statutory duty unless they can preserve the confidentiality of all communications to them regarding the character, reputation or antecedents of applicants for their consent.” 
        
       
      
    153   Notwithstanding the categorisation of the claim as a class claim, he continued to recognise, as he had in Conway v Rimmer that even class claims are subject to a balancing exercise. Lord Reid had said in that case at 952: 
     
      
       
        
        “There may be special reasons for withholding some kinds of routine documents, but I think that the proper test to be applied is to ask, in the language of Lord Simon in  
        Duncan’s  
        case, whether the withholding of a document because it belongs to a particular class is really ‘necessary for the proper functioning of the public service.’” 
        
       
      
    154   In Rogers v Home Secretary, Lord Reid added (at 401): 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not think that ‘the public service’ should be construed narrowly. Here the question is whether the withholding of this class of documents is really necessary to enable the board adequately to perform its statutory duties. If it is, then we are enabling the will of Parliament to be carried out.” 
        
       
      
    155   In extending the relevant type of class claim beyond that of police informer to informants who provided information to a body such as the Gaming Board, his Lordship stated at 401: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has long been recognised that the identity of police informers must in the public interest be kept secret and the same considerations must apply to those who volunteer information to the board. Indeed, it is in evidence that many refuse to speak unless assured of absolute secrecy. 
        
       
      
    156   … 
     
      
       
        
        It is possible that some documents coming from the board could be disclosed without fear of such consequences [that is, identifying the informant to the person informed upon]. But I would think it quite impracticable for the board or the court to be sure of this. So it appears to me that, if there is not to be very serious danger of the board being deprived of information essential for the proper performance of their difficult task, there must be a general rule that they are not bound to produce any document which gives information to them about an applicant.” 
        
       
      
    157   Lord Salmon recognised that the classes of case to which the immunity attaches are not fixed. However, at 412 he cautioned against an unconstrained extension of the immunity: 
     
      
       
        
        “This immunity should not lightly be extended to any other class of document or information, but its boundaries are not to be regarded as immutably fixed. The principle is that whenever it is clearly contrary to the public interest for a document or information to be disclosed, then it is in law immune from disclosure. If a new class comes into existence to which this principle applies then that class enjoys the same immunity.” 
        
       
      
    158   The question of extending the categories of case in which immunity could be granted arose again in D v NSPCC. The NSPCC was a voluntary society founded in 1889 and incorporated by royal charter. Its charter functions included the prevention of public and private wrongs against children and the taking of action for the enforcement of laws for their protection. The uncontradicted evidence of the Director of the NSPCC was that the work of the society was dependent upon its receiving prompt information of suspected child abuse. The evidence of the Director was that without an effective promise of confidentiality neighbours and others would be hesitant to pass on to the society information about suspected child abuse. 
     
      
    159   The House of Lords upheld the claim for immunity on the basis that the public interest which was invoked to protect disclosure of the sources of the Society’s information was analogous to the public interest which underlay the protection of evidence as to the identity of police informers. 
     
      
    160   The House was fortified in recognising the claim because of its decision five years earlier in Rogers v Home Secretary. As Lord Diplock said at 218: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Lordships’ sense of values might well be open to reproach if this House were to treat the confidentiality of information given to those who are authorised by statute to institute proceedings for the protection of neglected or ill-treated children as entitled to less favourable treatment in a court of law than information given to the Gaming Board so that gaming may be kept clean.” 
        
       
      
    161   The extension of the immunity by analogy to the police informer category was underpinned by other factors. First, there were three separate authorities which could bring care proceedings in respect of neglected or ill-treated children - the police, local authorities and the NSPCC. If the police brought proceedings, the House considered that the identity of their sources of information would be protected under the established immunity for police informants. Lord Diplock considered therefore that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[t]o draw a distinction in this respect between information given to the police and that passed directly to a local authority or to the NSPCC would seem much too irrational a consequence to have been within the contemplation of Parliament when enacting the Children and Young Persons Act 1969.” 
        
       
      
    162   Lord Hailsham at 229 also referred to the manifest absurdity of protecting the identity of informers depending upon who was the prosecuting authority, holding that the public interest in respect of each was identical. Lord Hailsham also considered, at 218, that it was of significance that the courts had long been concerned with the welfare of children, as exemplified by the role of the Crown as parens patriae and the long history in the United Kingdom of legislation directed to protecting the welfare of children. 
     
      
    163   Lord Hailsham concluded at 230: 
     
      
       
        
        “[t]he categories of public interest are not closed, and must alter from time to time whether by restriction or extension as social conditions and social legislation develop.” 
        
       
      
    164   Unlike what had been said in Rogers v Home Secretary, Lord Diplock did not see that there was any basis in principle or policy for confining public interest as a ground for non-disclosure of documents or information to the effective functioning of departments or organs of central government, even in the extended sense given to the ‘public service’ in that case. He noted that in Conway v Rimmer the public interest protected was the effective functioning of a county police force; that in In Re D (Infants) [1970] 1 WLR 599 the interest protected was the effective functioning of a local authority in relation to the welfare of boarding house children. See also Lord Edmund-Davies in D v NSPCC at 245. The public interest to be protected in D v NSPCC itself was the effective functioning of an organisation authorised under an Act of Parliament to bring legal proceedings for the welfare of children. 
     
      
    165   Lord Simon, at 232, traced through the various immunities and privileges which excluded relevant evidence from disclosure, stating, at 233, that there was “a continuum of relevant evidence which may be excluded from forensic scrutiny”. He had earlier noted at 232 that the administration of justice is “one facet only of a wider public interest - namely, the maintenance of the Queen’s peace”: see also Attorney-General (NSW) v Stuart per Hunt CJ at CL at 675.  
     
      
    166   The basis upon which their Lordships recognised a new class of documents as being protected by public interest immunity was by analogy with an existing class. A broader approach to the extension of the immunity had been urged on the House, namely that once a public interest was identified, the court must consider that interest again the administration of justice, as countervailing public interest and determine in the circumstances of the particular case whether to grant or refuse disclosure. The House clearly rejected the broad approach: Lord Diplock at 219-220; Lord Hailsham at 224-225; Lord Simon at 235.  
     
      
    167   The position in England since D v NSPCC has varied. The claim for immunity in Science Research Council v Nasse was rejected because, although the documents sought to be protected were confidential, no particular aspect of the public interest was established. Later English cases have taken an expansive view of public interest immunity but the decisions seem at least partly to have depended on the discretionary power contained in the Supreme Court Rules.  
     
      
    168   In R v K (1993) 97 Cr App R 342 (UK) it was accepted without argument that public interest immunity attached to a video tape of an interview at a hospital for therapeutic purposes of two boys who had allegedly been sexually assaulted by their father. The issue in the appeal was whether the trial judge should himself have viewed the video tape, before ruling that it should not be disclosed. 
     
      
    169   The issue has also arisen in Australia. Relationships Australia v Pasternak (1996) 133 FLR 462 was a case where the relevant legislation provided that evidence of anything said at a conference with a marriage counsellor was not admissible in any court authorised to hear evidence. The Full Court of the Family Court held that such information was immune, not only from admission into evidence, but also from pre-trial production and inspection. The Court said at 470: 
     
      
       
        
        “we think it is tolerably clear that the intention of the legislature as expressed in the Act is that what is said at a conference with a marriage counsellor is, subject to appropriate statutory exceptions, not only immune from admission in evidence in proceedings but also from court processes available to compel the disclosure of information to parties in proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    170   At 472-473 the Court dealt with an alternative submission that the documents subpoenaed were immune from inspection by reason of public interest immunity. The Court concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “In our view, it is appropriate, given the confidentiality of the environment in which the documents the subject of this appeal were produced, that a claim for class ‘privilege’ be made.” 
        
       
      
    171   A claim for public interest immunity in a different context was upheld by Wood J in Finch v Grieve where the New South Wales Bar Council was held to be entitled to claim public interest immunity in respect of documents received by the Bar Council giving rise to an allegation of misconduct against a barrister. The claim was considered by his Honour against the background of the statutory regime which regulates the conduct of barristers. Wood J noted that protection was required because there was a: 
     
      
       
        
        “substantial public interest in the Bar Council receiving complaints about misconduct of barristers, in being able to speak freely with such complaints, in being able to fully investigate those complaints and in appropriate cases being able to gather additional evidence. This is part and parcel of a public interest that it effectively carry out the statutory functions assigned to it, and that the legislation as a whole be implemented. The public interest is obvious and hardly needs stating. The public are to be protected from barristers who are guilty of professional misconduct, or unsatisfactory professional conduct, and are entitled to have effective orders made not only for the disciplining of those barristers who offend, but to have their losses made good. These are the ends the Act serves, and it provides an effective means for discipline and compensation.” 
        
       
      
    172   In B v N (1994) 35 NSWLR 140 it was common ground that documents which the Protective Commissioner was subpoenaed to produce in an action for damages for personal injury brought by the Commissioner on behalf of a protected person attracted public interest immunity, although Hodgson J, after conducting the balancing process, ruled that the documents should be produced. 
     
      
    173   Public interest immunity in the present or related field has been recognised at District Court level in Howe v State of South Australia (1998) 196 LSJS 182 and R v Bull (1997) 17 SR(WA) 364. 
     
      
    174   In New Zealand, a claim for immunity was rejected in M v L [1997] 3 NZLR 424. The plaintiffs had brought an action for damages for sexual abuse against a school teacher and persons associated with the school. The plaintiffs had included in their discovery a reference to notes made by doctors and counsellors they had consulted, but had claimed privilege from production of those notes. The question arose whether the defendants should be granted an order for inspection of the notes. The New Zealand High Court decided that a common law class privilege for counselling notes should not be recognised or created, but held the matter was properly deal with under the discretionary power contained in the rules of court. 
     
      
    175   In Jaffee v Redmond (1996) 518 US 1, the Supreme Court of the United States recognised the existence of privilege in respect of communications between a psychotherapist and patient in the course of diagnosis or treatment, and then extended the privilege to the communications between a patient and a social worker in the course of psychotherapy with the patient. 
     
      
    176   Jaffe v Redmond was not a case of sexual assault, but a damages claim against a a police officer brought by the family of a man shot by the police officer in the course of duty. After the shooting, the police officer had received counselling from a clinical social worker. The family sought access to the counselling records. 
     
      
    177   The US Supreme Court, by majority, upheld the Court of Appeals ruling that the records were privileged. In doing so, it referred to r 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which authorised Federal Courts to define new evidentiary privileges by interpreting “common law principles … in the light of reason and experience”. The majority found it compelling that all fifty states “have enacted into law some form of psychotherapist privilege” (at 12) and considered that “policy determinations by state legislatures” could be treated as reflecting both “reason” and “experience” within the meaning of r 501 (at 13). Rule 501 was based upon the observation made by the Supreme Court in its earlier decision Wolfle v United States 291 US 7 at 12 that “the common law is not immutable but flexible, and by its own principles, adapts itself to varying conditions” and the further observation in Hawkins v United States 358 US 74 that changes in privileges may be “dictated by ‘reason and experience’”.  
     
      
    178   The majority held at 10 that “like the spousal and attorney-client privileges, the psychotherapist-patient privilege is rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust”. Their Honours noted (at 10) that the 1972 Judicial Conference Advisory Committee, in recommending the acceptance of a psychotherapist privilege, observed that a psychiatrist’s ability to help a patient: 
     
      
       
        
        “is completely dependent upon [the patient’s] willingness and ability to talk freely. This makes it difficult if not impossible for [a psychiatrist] to function without being able to assure … patients of confidentiality and, indeed, privileged communication. Where there may be exceptions to this general rule …, there is wide agreement that confidentiality is a  
        sine qua non  
        for successful psychiatric treatment.” 
        
       
      
    179   This and other material before them demonstrated there was an “important private interest” to be served by recognition of the privilege. They identified the “public end” necessary to found the privilege as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… facilitating the provision of appropriate treatment for individuals suffering the effects of a mental or emotional problem. The mental health of our citizenry, no less than its physical health, is a public good of transcendent importance.” 
        
       
      
    180   Justice Stevens, writing for the majority, contrasted this with the evidentiary benefit which would result from non-recognition of the privilege, which he considered to be modest. 
     
      
    181   Stevens J concluded at 15: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because we agree with the judgment of the state legislatures and the Advisory Committee that a psychotherapist-patient privilege will serve a ‘public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilising all rational means for ascertaining truth’ … we hold that confidential communications between a licensed psychotherapist and her patients in the course of diagnosis or treatment are protected from compelled disclosure under r 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.” 
        
       
      
    182   The majority held that the privilege was an absolute one. 
     
      
    183   In attaching significance to the legislative activity in the various states, the majority observed that the Supreme Court had long held that it could have regard to the policy decisions of the States (given effect by legislation) in determining whether to recognise a new privilege or amend the coverage of an existing one. Another significant factor in their recognition of the privilege was the disparity which would be caused if a privilege, recognised in state courts and by state statutes, was not honoured in a federal court. Stevens J observed, at 13, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[d]enial of the federal privilege therefore would frustrate the purposes of the state legislation that was enacted to foster these confidential communications.” 
        
       
      
    184   Stevens J considered that it was of no consequence that at state level, recognition of the privilege was the product of legislation, rather than judicial development, commenting that “the present unanimous acceptance [by state legislatures] shows that the state law makers moved quickly” and demonstrated “only that the States rapidly recognised the wisdom of the rule as the field of psychotherapy developed”. 
     
      
    185   In extending the privilege to “licensed social workers in the course of psychotherapy”, Stevens J stated at 15-16: 
     
      
       
        
        “[t]oday, social workers provide a significant amount of mental health treatment. … Their clients often include the poor and those of modest means who could not afford the assistance of a psychiatrist or psychologist … but whose counselling sessions serve the same public goals.” 
        
       
      
    186   It is fair to say that Justice Scalia’s dissent (joined in by Chief Justice Rehnquist) was scathing, not the least aspects of which was his criticisms of was the “easy slide” made by the majority from the recognition of the psychotherapist privilege to recognising privilege for the communications of “licensed social workers in the course of psychotherapy”; the disconformity between the various state laws; and the notion that the evidentiary role of the material covered by the privilege would be slight. Justice Scalia’s viewpoint may best be summed up in his conclusion (at 35) that: 
     
      
       
        
        “...given our extensive precedent to the effect that new privileges ‘in derogation of the search for truth’ ‘are not lightly created’,  
        United States v Nixon 
         418 US at 710 the answer the Court gives today is inexplicable.” 
        
       
      
    187   In Canada, privilege has been recognised for counselling records in M v Ryan (1997) 143 DLR (4th) 1. In that case the Canadian Supreme Court held that records made by a psychiatrist were privileged. At 8 McLachlin J, who delivered the leading judgment, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “while the circumstances giving rise to a privilege were once thought to be fixed by categories defined in previous centuries - categories that do not include communications between a psychiatrist and her patient - it is now accepted that the common law permits privileges in new situations where reason, experience and application of the principles that underlie the traditional privileges so dictate [citations omitted]) ... The applicable principles are derived from those set forth in  
        Wigmore on Evidence  
        [citation omitted] para 2285. First, the communication must originate in a confidence. Second, the confidence must be essential to the relationship in which the communications arises. Third, the relationship must be one which should be ‘sedulously fostered’ in the public good. Finally, if all these requirements are met, the court must consider whether the interests served by protecting the communications from disclosure outweigh the interest in getting at the truth and disposing correctly of the litigation.” 
        
       
      
    188   McLachlin J found that all of these conditions were satisfied. She declined, at 13, to follow “the all-or-nothing approach adopted by the majority of the Supreme Court of the United States of endorsing an absolute privilege for all psychotherapist records in Jaffee v Redmond” and held that the court was required to engage in a balancing exercise to determine whether the particular documents should be disclosed.  
     
      
    189   Two remarks should be made about the Canadian decision. In the first place, the Court described the claim made as one of privilege, not immunity (as did the Court in Jaffee). The question of public interest immunity was not discussed, although it is not entirely clear which concept was under consideration. This is important as privilege may be waived and secondary evidence may be given of privileged material. Secondly, there was considerable emphasis placed upon the right to privacy entrenched in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. New South Wales does not have a Charter or a Bill of Rights. I do not consider, however, that the existence of an entrenched Charter right makes a difference as to whether counselling records of sexual assault victims are protected by public interest immunity, as the confidential nature of the relationship between counsellor and patient is well recognised.  
     
      
       
      Position in New South Wales 
       
      
    190   The common law as it stands in New South Wales at this time may be summarised as follows. 
     
      
       
      (i) The categories of public interest immunity are not closed. 
       
       
      (ii) Confidential communications, per se, are not protected by the principle of public interest immunity and there is no privilege of confidentiality. 
       
       
      The rules which govern claims for immunity are different to those which govern claims to privilege. Privilege may be waived. It follows that a party has a choice to claim or not claim the privilege and secondary evidence may be given of a privileged document.  
       
       
      (iv) There has been no previously recognised head of immunity or privilege to protect counselling records in sexual assault cases. 
       
       
      Issue 
       
      
    191   The claim which was made in this case was based on public interest immunity. No alternative claim for privilege was made. Had the claim been one for privilege, the complainant would have faced the further difficulty that the privilege was not hers but that of her counsellor: see Breen v Williams (1996) 186 CLR 71 and thus subject to waiver at their instance.  
     
      
    192   The public interest involved in the claim was that identified by Dr McGregor in his affidavit sworn 28 August 1998. His evidence was that the complainant was still suffering from the long-term effects of the offences alleged and that her condition was likely to be aggravated if the documents were disclosed; and that unless the Department could guarantee the confidentiality of its records, clients would lose their confidence in sexual assault counselling services and this would impede the effective functioning of the counselling service. He concluded:  
     
      
       
        
        “[t]his would be to the detriment of victims of sexual assault, those upon whom they are dependent, the criminal justice system and the public interest, as sexual assault victims probably would be discouraged from endeavouring to rehabilitate themselves by obtaining the benefit of sexual assault counselling, and possibly from reporting sexual assaults”.  
        
       
       
      Principal Argument Against Recognition of Immunity 
       
      
    193   The principal argument put against the extension of the immunity is that it will prevent relevant evidence from being disclosed to the accused. This submission however, merely asserts the primary tenet to which both public interest immunity and privilege form an exception.  
     
      
       
      Factors in Support of the Immunity 
       
      
    194   I have already made some reference to the evidence of Dr McGregor. Dr McGregor also referred to the Attorney-General’s second reading speech in respect of the Evidence Amendment (Confidential Communications) Bill. The second reading speech was relied on, in accordance with s34 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), in support of the argument that the relevant Evidence Act provisions applied derivatively to ancillary proceedings to protect from pre-trial disco very any evidence which would be protected from disclosure during the trial. I consider that the speech, being a contemporary statement made in Parliament by the Government’s first law officer, is also available to this Court to assist in considering whether the ‘public interest’ is such as to attract the immunity doctrine for the class of documents in this case.  
     
      
    195   Relevant excerpts from the Attorney-General’s second reading speech follow. 
     
      
       
        
        “It goes without saying that a person who has suffered the grave trauma of sexual assault will often be assisted in recovery by seeking counselling. The counselling relationship, built on confidentiality, privacy and trust, enables a victim to explore major issues concerning her sense of safety, privacy and self-esteem. The knowledge that details of a victim’s conversations with her therapist may be used against her in subsequent criminal proceedings can inhibit the counselling process and undermine its efficacy. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Knowing that a perpetrator has had access to counselling files can further traumatise victims and increase their sense of powerlessness. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
         
        [In submissions made to the Attorney-General in response to a discussion paper entitled “Protecting Confidential Communications From Disclosure in Court”] it was argued that the failure to accord counselling records a privilege has had the following consequences: 
         
         
        some victims chose not to obtain counselling; 
         
         
        some obtain counselling but are guarded about what they reveal; 
         
         
        some victims refuse to report the crime or be a witness for the prosecution; 
         
         
        some counsellors do not take notes; 
         
         
        some counsellors take notes which are cryptic and cannot be understood by others; and 
         
         
        some counsellors refuse to hand over the notes and are charged with contempt. 
         
         
        These are undesirable outcomes. Where a victim refuses to initiate court proceedings or undergo counselling, or to the extent to which the openness of the counselling relationship is constrained, both the interests of the victim and the interests of the community in general are harmed” 
         (emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    196   Cossins and Pilkington in ‘Balancing the Scales: the case for the inadmissibility of counselling records in sexual assault trials’, UNSWLJ 19(2):222 support these arguments. At 225-226 they refer to the case studies reported by the Working Party Concerning Confidentiality of Counsellors’ Notes, in Recommendations for the Protection of Counsellors’ Notes in Sexual Assault Court Matters, a submission to the New South Wales and Commonwealth Attorneys-General, March 1996 at 5 and conclude at 226: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a victim of sexual assault is faced with the dilemma between seeking counselling support in order to deal with the effects of being sexually assaulted, or reporting the sexual assault to the police.” 
        
       
      
    197   Cossins and Pilkington comment that anecdotal evidence obtained by the Working Party revealed that a sexual assault victim might withdraw a complaint if counselling files were subpoenaed.  
     
      
    198   The Sydney Rape Crisis Centre has reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “We consider the knowledge that counsellors’ notes can be subpoenaed to be a major barrier for women who have been raped to laying a complaint with police, going ahead with the hearing, contacting sexual assault services and even continuing contact with this Centre … We estimate that this issue has influenced the decision of at least 25 per cent of the women who have contacted SRCC over the past 5 years … [out of about] 2700 new contacts per year… These women decided not to report to the police, not to proceed with court cases and in some instances to discontinue contact with sexual assault services… SRCC is the only rape crisis/sexual assault service in NSW where women who contact can remain completely anonymous … Women who contact frequently mention that they would not contact another sexual assault service because of a perceived and/or actual lack of complete confidentiality of files.” 
        
       
      
    199   Official figures reveal that in 1998 14,568 reports of sexual assault were recorded by police in Australia: Australian Bureau of Statistics, Recorded Crime, published 16 June 1999. The Sydney Rape Crisis Centre suggests that the incidence of sexual assault may be significantly higher, and American research indicates that an even higher percentage of complainants may refuse counselling if anonymity is not preserved: see Cossins and Pilkington at 230.  
     
      
    200   There is also judicial support for the view that the availability of counselling reports may inhibit the reporting of sexual assault. In R v Osolin (1994) 109 DLR (4th) 478, L’Heureux Dube J observed at 500 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[o]ne of the most powerful disincentives to reporting sexual assaults is women’s fear of further victimisation at the hands of the criminal justice system.” 
        
       
      
    201   In addition to the legislative recognition of the need to protect these documents from being adduced in evidence, other significant public recognition has been given to the seriousness of the crime of sexual assault and the need to assist and protect the victims of sexual assault in various ways. In 1995 the New South Wales Health Department, the New South Wales Police Service and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, as the three government agencies primarily responsible for responding to victims of sexual assault, issued Interagency Guidelines for Responding to Adult Victims of Sexual Assault. The introduction to the Guidelines states (at 8-9): 
     
      
       
        
        “Sexual assault is a crime of violence. It is also a humiliating, degrading and often terrifying experience which can have long term effects on its victims. 
         
         
        Victims of sexual assault experience a range of feelings including shock, fear, guilt, shame, depression and an inability to trust others. The social stigma attached to sexual assault can heighten these feelings and increase the trauma experienced by victims, especially when they receive an uncaring, negative response from those to whom they report the assault. 
         
         
        The Sexual Assault Phone-in conducted by the NSW Sexual Assault Committee, held in November 1992, revealed that many victims of sexual assault do not tell anyone what has happened to them, neither friend, family member, police, or counsellor. This is cause for serious concern because as long as victims of sexual assault feel unable to tell anyone, they are deprived of the help and support they need. 
         
         
        Community education can encourage family and friends to respond positively to any disclosure of sexual assault but, in addition, to assist their recovery, victims (both male and female) also need a range of services and professional support including counselling, medical services and assistance in reporting the crime to the police. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Sexual assault is an area of considerable legal and social complexity. Those working with the victims of this crime need to develop a clear understanding of one another’s differing skills and areas of responsibility and cultivate more effective ways of working together in the interests of victims …”  
        (emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    202   The Guidelines recognise (at 16) that “… sexual assault is a crime of power and control …” and (at 19) that “[c]onfidentiality is a victim’s right”. Cossins and Pilkington note, at 225, that the breach of privacy and confidentiality which is inevitable if counselling records are made available can lead complainants to feel “re-victimised by procedures… reinforcing their experience of powerlessness and invasion from the original assault”.  
     
      
    203   Victims of sexual assault are eligible for statutory compensation under the Victims Compensation Act (NSW) 1996: see ss 6, 10, and Sch 1 cl 6. Under the Act victims of the most serious sexual assaults are entitled to compensation between $25,000 and $50,000. A person eligible for statutory compensation may apply for payment for approved counselling services: s 21. (Section 21 has been subsequently amended to remove the requirement that a person be eligible for statutory compensation prior to receiving counselling.) The section provides for an initial two hours of counselling and up to a further 20 hours as approved by a compensation assessor. Payment for counselling sessions beyond 20 hours may be approved by the Director. 
     
      
    204   The combination of these matters are, in my opinion, official recognition that there is an “interest”, which by the manner in which it has been recognised, is a “public interest”, in assisting victims of sexual assaults to deal with the impact of psychological trauma to which they have been subjected. The provision of compensation recognises that such trauma is productive of the type of injury which calls for compensation.  
     
      
    205   The question at issue here, however, is whether the “public interest” also requires that counselling communications be immune from disclosure. In asserting a positive answer to this question, the respondents also relied on the “gravitational pull” of statute law: see Akins v Abigroup Ltd (1998) 43 NSWLR 539 at 547-548. This notion was, as I have already described, influential in the majority decision in Jaffee v Redmond. 
     
      
    206   In support of this submission, reference was made to the fact that there are now three Australian states, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, which have or are about to have statutory provisions protecting the confidentiality of communications of victims of sexual assault and their counsellors. The New South Wales provisions are discussed in the judgment of James J. The protection which those provisions give is, on his view, limited to the trial stage. I agree with that view. 
     
      
    207   Section 1 of the Evidence (Confidential Communications) Act 1998 (Vic) provides that the purpose of the Act is: 
     
      
       
        
        “… to amend the Evidence Act 1958 so as to protect from disclosure in legal proceedings confidential communications between the victim or alleged victim of a sexual offence and a medical practitioner or counsellor. The Act enables a court to order disclosure but specifies matters about which the court must be satisfied before doing so.” 
        
       
      
    208   The Act inserts a new Division 2A into Part II of the Evidence Act 1958, dealing with confidential communications, which are defined to mean communications made in confidence by a person against whom a sexual assault has been, or has alleged to have been, committed and a medical practitioner or counsellor. 
     
      
    209   New s 32C provides that evidence is not to be adduced in a legal proceeding if it would disclose a confidential communication or the contents of a document recording a confidential communication unless the court grants leave to do so. Section 32D specifies the restrictions under which the court may grant leave to adduce protected evidence. They are similar to the provisions under s 26H(3) of the New South Wales Act. 
     
      
    210   In South Australia the Evidence (Confidential Communications) Amendment Bill 1998 has been introduced into Parliament. It, too, will amend that State’s Evidence Act and proposes a new Div 9 in Par VII of that Act. The proposed s 67C protects, under public interest immunity, a communication relating to a victim or alleged victim of a sexual offence made in a therapeutic context from disclosure in legal proceedings. In accordance with the common law principles governing public interest immunity, the statutory immunity cannot be waived. It is subject to a statutory balancing exercise and, importantly for present purposes, is not liable to discovery or any other form of pre-trial disclosure. 
     
      
    211   There is a significant difficulty in the respondent’s reliance on this statutory development as the High Court has said that there is one common law for Australia: Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997) 189 CLR 520, where the Court referred (at 563) to the (non-curial) statement of Sir Owen Dixon that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[w]e act every day on the unexpressed assumption that the one common law surrounds us and applies where it has not been superseded by statute.” 
        
       
      
    212   Dixon, ‘The Common Law as an Ultimate Constitutional Foundation’, 31 ALJ 240 at 241, reprinted in Jesting Pilate (1965) 203 at 205. 
     
      
    213   The difficulty in this case with relying on the legislative magnet is that the provisions of the New South Wales and Victorian Acts and the South Australian Bill are not identical. Presumably, they reflect the differing priorities which the respective legislatures accorded to various aspects of the issue. How does the Court of one state, in the initial stages of recognition of the development of the common law and the consequent statement of principle, deal with differing statutory schemes? What is the single true common law principle which emerges in such a circumstance? The difficulties which are reflected in the question seem to provide the answer. It is difficult in such circumstances to say that a single common law principle emerges from the differing statutory schemes, notwithstanding that each deals with the same topic. I would therefore reject statutory reform in these circumstances as a basis for finding the existence of a public interest which attracts the principle of evidentiary immunity.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    214   In this case, several aspects of the public interest were identified as being sufficient to attract the doctrine of public interest immunity - protecting victims and promoting victims’ recovery from sexual assault; facilitating the effective operation of sexual assault services; and encouraging complainants to report the crime of sexual assault to police. This last aspect of the public interest is, in my opinion, the linchpin in the respondent’s claim for immunity. In particular, it satisfies the requirement that new categories of public interest immunity develop by analogy with existing categories: in this case, that of police informers. 
     
      
    215   The material to which I have referred is of sufficient force and authority to satisfy me that the risk of disclosure of confidential counselling communications of sexual assault victims is, or can be, a significant deterrent to the reporting of sexual assaults, a serious and prevalent crime in our community. The other aspects of the public interest which were identified in the evidence, while not sufficient of themselves to attract the doctrine, support the application of the principle to the class of documents which is subject of the claim here. It was clearly recognised in both Rogers v Home Secretary and D v NSPCC that the need to protect confidentiality was relevant to the question whether the documents should be protected from disclosure. In the present case, I am of the opinion that the claim attracts the principles of public interest immunity and, subject to the balancing exercise which the court is required to carry out when such a claim is made, are protected from disclosure. I can see no policy reason why the immunity should not be extended to the class of documents subject of the present claim. 
     
      
    216   Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    217   ABADEE and BARR JJ: We generally agree with the draft judgments of the Chief Justice and James J. Subject to following additional observations, we also adopt the reasons and conclusions of James J and the reasons of the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    218   In our view the Court should be slow to expand the categories of public interest immunity, particularly in the area of criminal law. There are dangers in doing so in cases involving the public interest in the proper administration of criminal justice. 
     
      
    219   In Alister v The Queen (1983-1984) 154 CLR 404 at 431 Murphy J, speaking on the subject of the public interest in certain official information remaining secret, said at 431 - 
     
      
       
        
        [But] there is also the public interest in the proper administration of criminal justice. The processes of criminal justice should not be distorted to prevent an accused from defending himself (herself) properly. 
        
       
      
    220   The establishment of a public interest immunity of the kind contended for might distort the processes of criminal justice in the manner contemplated by his Honour and it seems to us that it is for the Parliament, not the Court, to determine whether such a significant change in the rights of accused persons is warranted. 
     
      
    221   In the instant case the reasons for rejecting the derivative application apply equally to the rejection of the creation of a public interest immunity of the kind advocated. The extension of the categories of public interest immunity in this case would not be by analogy with any existing category of privilege. The circumstances are quite unlike those in D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children [1978] AC 171, where the House of Lords applied the protection of the identity of informers rule by analogy to a claim for the protection of an informer to a society which could institute prosecution for cruelty to children. The analogy present in that case is not present here. 
     
      
    222   In Cain v Glass (No 2) (1985) 3 NSWLR 230 at 246-247 McHugh JA ,as his Honour then was, explained the rule relating to the protection of the identity of informers as the result of the immunity from disclosure granted to communications made in the public interest and as a particular manifestation of the doctrine of public interest immunity. Having cited D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, his Honour continued at 250 - 
     
      
       
        
        The method of the common law is to apply established principles to analogous cases. That is the source of its genius and capacity for growth. 
        
       
      
    223   In Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman (1984-1985) 157CLR 424 Brennan J, as his Honour then was, considered that novel categories of negligence should be developed incrementally and by analogy with established categories. In Breen v Williams (1995-1996) 186 CLR 71 Gaudron and McHugh JJ said at 115 - 
     
      
       
        
        Advances in the common law must begin from a baseline of accepted principle and proceed by conventional methods of legal reasoning. Judges have no authority to invent legal doctrine that distorts or does not extend or modify accepted legal rules and principles. Any changes in legal doctrine, brought about by judicial creativity, must “fit” within the body of accepted rules and principles. The judges of Australia cannot, so to speak, “make it up” as they go along. It is a serious constitutional mistake to think that the common law courts have authority to “provide a solvent” (165) for every social, political or economic problem. The role of the common law courts is a far more modest one. 
        
       
       
        
        In a democratic society, changes in the law that cannot logically or analogically be related to existing common law rules and principles are the province of the legislature. From time to time it is necessary for the common law courts to re-formulate existing legal rules and principles to take account of changing social conditions. Less frequently, the courts may even reject the continuing operation of an established rule or principle. But such steps can be taken only when it can be seen that the “new” rule or principle that has been created has been derived logically or analogically from other legal principles, rules and institutions. 
        
       
      
    224   There are here no established categories such as were considered necessary by Brennan J in Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman or accepted existing rules or principles considered necessary by Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Breen v Williams. 
     
      
    225   In our view, to establish the public interest immunity privilege contended for would be effectively to perform a legislative function and achieve what Parliament has not on the true construction of the legislation achieved: Newcastle CC v GIO General Limited (1997) 72 ALJR 97 per McHugh J at 110. 
     
      
    226   In Breen v Williams (1994) 35 NSWLR 522 Mahoney JA said at 557 - 
     
      
       
        
        … [It] is not the function of the courts to change the law by processes which are legislative rather than judicial … the function of the courts is to apply the law, not to legislate for change of it. 
        
       
      
    227   His Honour also observed at 558 that where what is in question is a competition between competing social claims which involve the making of a general social judgment, and where it is claimed that changes should be made to the rights of parties to give effect to that social judgment, it is for the legislature, which is accountable to the community and to those members of it whose rights will be affected, to make such changes. To like effect is the judgment of Mason J, as his Honour then was, in SGIC v Trigwell & Ors (1978) 142 CLR 617 at 633-634. 
     
      
    228   In our view, the instant case may alternatively be seen as involving competing social claims, the resolution of which ought to be left to the legislature. 
     
      
    229   By enacting the Evidence Amendment (Confidential Communications) Act, the legislature has addressed a public interest concern by creating a new class of statutory immunity, whose nature and extent have been precisely identified. It is difficult in the circumstances to see why the common law should be changed to create, in effect, a new privilege outside the precise boundaries drawn by the legislature. It seems to us that there are good reasons why no such change should be introduced by the Court, at least where the rights of an accused person would be affected. There is a fundamental distinction between the right to adduce evidence at a trial and the right to make proper pre-trial investigation. 
     
      
    230   Moreover, if the common law were to be so extended it is quite unclear where the boundaries of the new immunity should be drawn. Understandably, the terms of the statute give no assistance. Should its terms, then, be modified to accommodate pre-trial procedures? If so, what should be the scope and content of the modification? Should some other way be devised of limiting the new rule? Merely to ask these questions shows that the Court is being asked to legislate. 
     
      
    231   We agree with the orders proposed by James J. 
     
      
    232   JAMES J: This is an appeal by Brian James Young pursuant to s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act against an interlocutory order made in the District Court by his Honour Judge Freeman on 1 September 1998, which was expressed as being an order declining to allow the appellant access to documents which had been produced in response to four subpoenas issued on behalf of the appellant, which were directed to the Tamworth Base Hospital, a member of the Sexual Assault Service attached to the Tamworth Base Hospital, a member of the Community Mental Health Team attached to the Tamworth Base Hospital and a psychiatrist practising in Tamworth. The principal respondent to the appeal is an entity known as the New England Area Health Service, which provides various health services to the public in the New England area, including those provided by the Tamworth Base Hospital and which was treated as representing all of the persons who had been subpoenaed. The Crown was also represented on the hearing of the appeal, the Crown Prosecutor informing the court that the attitude of the Crown was “neutral”. The court granted leave to the Attorney General of New South Wales to intervene and counsel for the Attorney General made submissions generally in support of the submissions made by the Health Service. It was accepted by all parties on the hearing of the appeal that the order made by Judge Freeman was an interlocutory order within the meaning of that term in s5F and that therefore the appeal was competent. Judge Freeman granted a certificate under s5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act, so that there is no need for this Court to grant leave to appeal under s5F(3)(a). 
     
      
    233   It is necessary to refer to some of the background facts. 
     
      
    234   On 8 October 1996 the appellant had been charged with one count of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault, both allegedly committed on the previous day against the same complainant, a teenage girl, who I will refer to simply as “the complainant”. The complainant had on 8 October 1996 made a statement to the police in which, as well as giving an account of the alleged offences, she said that she had disclosed to the appellant that she was suffering from depression, that she had previously been admitted to the psychiatric ward of the Tamworth Base Hospital and that she had previously been sexually abused. 
     
      
    235   On 20 December 1996 the complainant made a further statement to the police, which included the following paragraph:- 
     
      
        
       
        
        “I hereby give permission for the New South Wales Police Service to approach my consulting psychologist Dr de Groot and obtain from that doctor any relevant mental health information that is required to assist the Crown in the preparation of the case against Mr Brian J Young”. 
        
       
      
    236   Dr de Groot is in fact a psychiatrist practicing in partnership at Tamworth. On 7 January 1997 Dr de Groot wrote a letter to the police. In this letter Dr de Groot stated that the complainant had been seen professionally by himself or one of his partners on a number of occasions, commencing in August 1996. The complainant had been diagnosed as suffering from a personality disorder, with problems adjusting to events which occurred within her home environment. Dr de Groot’s letter concluded with the following passage:- 
     
      
       
        
        “During one of her admissions she claimed to have been subjected to two rape incidents and have become distressed by the fact that she had been taking hard drugs and had had a friend who had died recently. Later on she withdrew one of the claims of rape and also the claims of drug use and friend’s death”. 
        
       
      
    237    On either 20 or 29 May 1998 the Crown, pursuant to its obligation to exercise fairness towards an accused person in criminal proceedings, served a copy of Dr de Groot’s letter on the appellant.  
     
      
    238    The appellant’s legal advisers issued subpoenas for production, addressed respectively to the Medical Records Clerk of the Tamworth Base Hospital, Susan Hayman of the Sexual Assault Service attached to the Tamworth Base Hospital and Denise Pierce of the Community Health Team attached to the Tamworth Base Hospital. All of the three subpoenas required production of “all patient’s notes, records, files and like documents relating to (the complainant)”. A fourth subpoena was issued to Dr de Groot, no copy of which was before this Court but which the Court was informed was in similar terms. 
     
      
    239    The trial of the appellant on the two charges was listed to commence in the District Court at Tamworth on 31 August 1998. On 28 August 1998 Dr McGregor of the New South Wales Department of Health made an affidavit. In his affidavit Dr McGregor said in paragraph 1:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I am the Deputy Director-General, Operations, of the Department of Health (“the Department”). The Department is charged with the responsibility of administering area and rural health services providing a wide range of services to the public. The New England Area Health Service is one such health service, of which Tamworth Base Hospital (which includes the Banksia Mental Health Unit) and the Tamworth Community Health Service are parts”. 
        
       
      
    240    Dr McGregor then said in his affidavit that he had considered the subpoenas addressed to the Tamworth Base Hospital, Ms Hayman and Ms Pierce. He said that certain documents falling within the terms of the subpoenas would be produced, without any objection to the appellant having access. However, objection would be taken to the production of other documents on the ground of sexual assault communication privilege pursuant to s126H of the Evidence Act. These documents included notes relating to the complainant by sexual assault counsellors and by mental health counsellors and psychiatrists. Pars8, 9 and 10 of Dr McGregor’s affidavit were in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “8. I also object to production of such documents on the ground that production would be injurious to the public interest, both under the common law and because disclosure of the documents would prejudice the proper functioning of the government of the State of New South Wales, that is, the proper functioning of the Department ( 
        Evidence Act 
         1995, s130(4)(f). 
        
       
       
        
        9. I am informed by Ms Carol Bourke, psychologist, and verily believe that (the complainant) probably is continuing to suffer from the long-term effects of the offences alleged against the Accused and that such suffering probably would be seriously aggravated were the records listed in paragraphs 4 and 5 above to be disclosed. 
        
       
       
        
        10. If the Department cannot guarantee to its clients that it will not pass on information conveyed in and for the purposes of counselling persons who are or become sexual assault victims, then its failure to do so would result in clients losing their confidence in sexual assault counselling services and in such services ceasing to function effectively. This would be to the detriment of victims of sexual assault, those upon whom they are dependent, the criminal justice system and the public interest, as sexual assault victims probably would be discouraged from endeavouring to rehabilitate themselves by obtaining the benefit of sexual assault counselling, and possibly from reporting sexual assaults”. 
        
       
      
    241    The question of whether the appellant should be permitted to have access to the documents falling within the terms of the subpoenas which the persons subpoenaed objected to produce was argued before Judge Freeman on 31 August and 1 September. Counsel appeared for the New South Wales Department of Health, which was regarded as representing all of the persons who had been served with subpoenas. The same counsel also said that he was appearing for the complainant. The issue to be decided by his Honour was identified by his Honour as being whether the appellant should be granted access to the documents in respect of which privilege was claimed (which I will from now on refer to simply as “the documents”). It would seem that the issue would more appropriately have been identified as being whether the persons subpoenaed were entitled to object to produce the documents on the grounds that the documents were privileged from production but nothing turns on this distinction. (See Attorney-General for New South Wales v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 especially at 672-3) 
     
      
    242    During the course of the hearing Judge Freeman inquired whether the claim of rape which the complainant had withdrawn, which was referred to in Dr de Groot’s letter of 7 January 1997, related to one of the offences which the complainant alleged the appellant had committed. Pursuant to this inquiry made by Judge Freeman, Dr de Groot supplied a further letter dated 1 September in which he said that the charge of rape which the complainant had withdrawn, which had been referred to in his earlier letter of 7 January 1997, did not relate to the matter currently before the court but related to an earlier incident.  
     
      
    243    At the hearing before Judge Freeman counsel for the Department of Health ultimately conceded that the appellant had a legitimate forensic purpose in having access to the documents. However, he submitted that the documents were privileged under Div1B of Pt3.10 of the Evidence Act (Sexual assault communications privilege) or section 130 in Div3 of Pt3.10 (Exclusion of evidence of matters of state). Div1A of Pt3.10 of the Act (Professional confidential relationship privilege) was adverted to but in his judgment of 1 September Judge Freeman said that he saw “no reason to harp back to the earlier provisions in Div1A, when the scheme in Div1B is specifically targeted to the present situation”.  
     
      
    244    Div1B of Pt3.10 of the Evidence Act was inserted in the Act by the Evidence Amendment (Confidential Communications) Act 1997 No.122, which commenced on 1 January 1998, and it is necessary to set out a number of provisions of Div1B. In s126G (along with other definitions) the expressions “protected confidence” and “protected counselling communication” are defined as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Protected confidence 
         means a protected counselling communication made by a person against whom a sexual assault offence has been, or is alleged to have been, committed, whether before or after the acts constituting the offence occurred or are alleged to have occurred”. 
        
       
       
        
        protected counselling communication 
         means a communication made by a person in confidence to another person (in this Division called the  
        counsellor 
        ) in the course of a relationship in which the counsellor is treating the person for any emotional or psychological condition suffered by the person”. 
        
       
      
    245    The offences charged against the appellant are sexual assault offences within the meaning of that expression in Div1B. 
     
      
    246    Section 126H, which is a key provision, should be set out in full:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Exclusion of evidence of protected sexual assault communications 
         
         
        (1) Evidence is not to be adduced in a proceeding if it would disclose: 
         
         
         (a) a protected confidence, or 
         
         (b) the contents of a document recording a protected confidence, 
         
         
         unless the court gives leave to adduce the evidence 
         
         
        (2) Evidence of a protected confidence or the contents of a document recording a protected confidence is not to be adduced if the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence to: 
         
         
         (a) each other party, and 
         
         (b) if the protected confider is not a party, the protected confider, and 
         
         (c) if the counsellor is not a party, the counsellor. 
         
         
        (3) The court must not give leave to adduce evidence of a protected confidence or a document recording a protected confidence unless the court is satisfied that: 
         
         
         (a) the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have substantial probative value, and 
         
         (b) other evidence of the protected confidence or the document recording the protected confidence is not available, and 
         
         (c) the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or a document of substantial probative value 
         
         
        (4) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of subsection (3)(c), the court must take into account the likelihood, and the nature or extent, of harm that would be caused to the protected confider if evidence of the protected confidence or document is adduced. 
         
         
        (5) The court must state its reasons for giving or refusing to give leave under this section. 
         
         
        (6) A protected confider or counsellor who is not a party to proceedings may, with the leave of the court, appear in the proceedings”. 
        
       
      
    247   Section 126I provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence given with the consent of the protected confider concerned.” 
        
       
      
    248   Section 126J provides that sexual assault communications privilege may be lost by misconduct. Section 126K provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Without limiting any action the court may take to limit the possible harm, or extent of the harm, likely to be caused by the disclosure of evidence of a protected confidence, the court may: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) order that all or part of the evidence be heard in camera, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) make such orders relating to the suppression of publication of all or part of the evidence given before the court as, in its opinion, are necessary to protect the safety and welfare of the protected confider and counsellor, and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) make such orders relating to disclosure of protected identity information as, in the opinion of the court, are necessary to protect the safety and welfare of the protected confider and counsellor. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Nothing in this section limits the power of a court to make an order under section 577A, 578 or 578B of the  
        Crimes Act 1900”. 
        
       
      
    249   Section 126L provides in part as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) This Division does not apply in relation to a proceeding the hearing of which began before the commencement of this Division. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) This Division applies in respect of a protected confidence whether made before or after the commencement of this Division.” 
        
       
      
    250    It is clear that Div1B applies to the present proceedings, because the hearing of the proceedings had not begun before the commencement of the amending Act (s126L(1)) and it is also clear from s126L(2) that Div1B applies to protected confidences which were made before the commencement of the amending Act. 
     
      
    251    In his judgment of 1 September 1998 Judge Freeman held that the provisions of Div1B, notwithstanding some of the language used and particularly the frequent use of expressions such as “the adducing of evidence”, apply to the production of documents on subpoena and the allowing of access to documents produced on subpoena and are not limited to the adducing of evidence in a courtroom in the course of a hearing. Henceforth, I will for the sake of convenience refer to such a holding as a holding that Div1B applies to the production of documents. 
     
      
    252    On the submissions which were put to him Judge Freeman could have reached the conclusion that Div1B applies to the production of documents by either of two paths. His Honour could have found that Div1B applies “directly” to the production of documents, that is that the terms of Div1B, properly construed, apply to the production of documents; or his Honour could have found that Div1B applies “indirectly” or “derivatively” to the production of documents, that is while the provisions of Div1B, properly construed, do not apply to the production of documents, nevertheless the common law applying to the production of documents should be modified so as to accord with the provisions of Div1B applying to the adducing of evidence in a courtroom in a hearing. His Honour was referred to a trilogy of cases, in which it had been held that the provisions of Div1 of Pt3.10 of the Evidence Act, which deals with client legal privilege, apply, not directly, but derivatively, to the production of documents. These cases were Telstra Corporation v Australia Media Holdings & Ors (“Telstra”) (1997) 41 NSWLR 277 (McLelland CJ in Equity); Adelaide Steamship Co Limited v Spalvins (“Adsteam”) (1998) 152 ALR 417 (Federal Court of Australia Full Court); and Akins v Abigroup Limited (“Akins”) (1998) 43 NSWLR 539 (Court of Appeal). Although it is a possible view of one part of his Honour’s judgment that his Honour held that Div1B applies directly to the production of documents, I am doubtful whether his Honour did make such a holding. His Honour certainly did hold that Div1B applies derivatively to the production of documents. At p9 of his judgment his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As indicated earlier the Evidence Act deals with admission into evidence but I believe I am compelled by the reasoning of cases which bind me to hold that the principle of the Act applies derivatively to ancillary matters such as the production of document on subpoena and access thereto. 
        
       
       
        
        In short I find that Division 1B of the Evidence Act applies derivatively to ancillary matters, (the cases of  
        Telstra, Akins  
        and  
        Adelaide Steamship Company 
         all dealing with matters within part 3.10)” 
        
       
      
    253    Judge Freeman also held that confidential sexual assault communications attract public interest immunity (s130 of the Evidence Act). The public interests to be protected were those identified in the affidavit of Dr McGregor and a statement by Ms Bourke. The statement by Ms Bourke was not read on the hearing of this appeal. 
     
      
    254    Judge Freeman further held that the complainant had not by the letter of 20 December 1996 to the police consented to the production of the documents. 
     
      
    255    Having held that Div1B applied derivatively to the production of documents, his Honour turned to s126H(3). Having inspected the documents produced, his Honour found that they did not have substantial probative value and accordingly the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of the protected confidences and in protecting the protected confider from harm was not substantially outweighed by the public interest in permitting access to the documents and accordingly access to the documents was refused. 
     
      
    256    It appears to me from the reading of Judge Freeman’s judgment that his Honour may not always have kept in mind that the only matters that can be privileged under Div1B are “protected confidences”, as defined in s126G, that is confidential communications made to a counsellor by a person who is being treated and against whom a sexual assault offence has (allegedly) been committed. In one part of his judgment his Honour said that he could find no warrant in the Act for a distinction sought to be drawn by counsel for the appellant between “medical observations and details of treatment, rather than the alleged victim’s own ruminations”. However, medical observations and details of treatment would not be “protected confidences”, so as to be capable of attracting privilege under Div1B. All that can be protected under Div1B are “the alleged victim’s own ruminations” or, more happily expressed, the alleged victim’s own confidential communications. 
     
      
    257    The expression “the contents of a document recording a protected confidence” used in Div1B must be read as meaning “the contents of a document insofar as they record a protected confidence”. The provisions of Div1B do not apply to the whole of the contents of a document simply because somewhere in the document a protected confidence is recorded. 
     
      
    258    A preliminary question which arose on the hearing of the appeal was whether the decision of this Court in R v N (unreported 21 July 1998) had resolved the issues between the parties. In R v N  an accused person had caused a number of subpoenas for production to be issued. Objection was taken to the production of some of the material subpoenaed on the grounds of Div1B. In R v N the issue was, without argument, treated as resolved by District Court Rules Pt29 r1 and r11. Pt29 of the District Court Rules deals with subpoenas. Pt29 r11 provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Nothing in this Part compels a person on whom a subpoena is served to produce a privileged document or thing”. 
        
       
      
    259    In r1 “privileged document or thing” is defined as including a document of which evidence could not be adduced in an action over the objection of any person by virtue of the operation of Pt3.10 of the Evidence Act. However, in the present appeal it was, in my opinion, conclusively demonstrated and it was accepted by all parties, that Pt29 of the District Court Rules was made in exercise of the power to make civil procedure rules for the District Court and does not apply to criminal proceedings. As what was said by this Court in R v N was said without the benefit of argument and would appear to be clearly incorrect, this Court should decline to follow R v N. (R v Mai 60 A Crim R 49 at 60). It should be noted that on 8 December 1998 leave to re-open the decision in R v N was refused. 
     
      
    260    The present appeal was first argued on two days in November 1998 before a Bench consisting of three judges, Abadee J, James J and Barr J. After the Court had reserved its decision the Full Court of the Federal Court on 22 December 1998 handed down its decision in Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commission of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia (“Esso”), another case dealing with Div1 of Pt310, in which the Court (consisting of five judges) overruled the earlier decision of the differently constituted Full Court of the Federal Court in Adsteam. 
     
      
    261    Also after this Court had initially reserved its decision, the High Court on 3 December 1998 heard argument in BT Australasia Pty Ltd v State of New South Wales (“BT”). In the course of the argument submissions were made that Adsteam had been wrongly decided and certain comments were made by some judges of the High Court about the derivative application of a statute so as to modify the common law. As it seemed that a decision by the High Court in BT might well have assisted this Court, this Court still constituted by the same three judges indicated at a mention of the present appeal in February 1999 that it would (within limits) defer giving judgment in the present appeal until after the High Court had handed down its decision in BT. However, no decision has been handed down by the High Court and we have in fact been informed that the BT litigation has been settled and that no decision will be given by the High Court. 
     
      
    262    On 11 March 1999 the High Court handed down its decision in Northern Territory of Australia v GPAO & Ors (1999) 73 ALJR 470, in which members of the Court made comments on the scope of the Commonwealth Evidence Act and whether that Act applies to the production of documents on subpoena or the giving of leave to inspect documents produced on subpoena. 
     
      
    263    Having regard to the conflicting authorities and particularly the decision of the Bench of five judges of the Federal Court in Esso, the Bench hearing this appeal was, with the consent of the parties, enlarged to five judges by the addition of the Chief Justice and Beazley JA and the enlarged Bench heard further argument on 29 March 1999 and then reserved its decision. After this Court reserved its decision the High Court granted special leave to appeal in Esso but the appeal has not yet been heard. 
     
      
    264    In my opinion, the issues on this appeal can be formulated as follows:- 
     
      
    265   1. Do the provisions of Div1B of Pt3.10 of the Evidence Act, properly interpreted, apply directly to the production of documents recording protected confidences within the definition of that expression in s126G. 
     
      
    266   2. If the provisions of Div1B of Pt3.10 do not, properly interpreted, apply directly to the production of documents recording protected confidences, do they nevertheless apply indirectly or derivatively. 
     
      
    267   3. If the provisions of Div1B apply either directly or derivatively to the production of documents recording protected confidences, did the complainant in the present case consent to the production of the documents which had been subpoenaed. 
     
      
    268   4. Whether or not the provisions of Div1B apply either directly or derivatively to the production of documents recording protected confidences, should protected confidences and documents recording protected confidences be recognised as forming a new category of public interest immunity. 
     
      
       
      1. Do the provisions of Div1B of Pt3.10 of the  
      Evidence Act 
       properly interpreted apply directly to the production of documents recording protected confidences within the definition of that expression in s126G. 
       
      
    269    The principal submissions made on behalf of the appellant were:- 
     
      
    270   (i) If the words used by the legislature in Div1B are interpreted according to their natural, ordinary meaning, then they should be interpreted as meaning that sexual assault communications privilege under Div1B is limited to the adducing of evidence at a hearing and does not apply to the production of documents on subpoena. There is a well recognised distinction between the adducing of evidence and the production of documents on subpoena.  
     
      
    271   (ii) The three cases which were referred to in Judge Freeman’s judgment and which were relied on by the respondents at the hearing of the present appeal, namely Telstra, Adsteam and Akins, do not support a submission that Div1B applies directly to the production of documents and are indeed contrary to such a submission. 
     
      
    272   (iii) Before the enactment of Div1B, if a subpoena for the production of records of sexual assault communications was issued and served on behalf of a person accused of a sexual assault, then, subject to the existence of any ground for setting aside the subpoena, the records would have had to have been produced to the court and, subject to the accused demonstrating a legitimate forensic purpose, the accused would have been permitted access to the records. Accordingly, it was submitted that the provisions of Div1B should be interpreted according to a principle of statutory construction that clear words are required to abrogate common law rights and especially the rights at common law of a criminal accused (see Akins at 547). 
     
      
    273    The essential submissions which were made on behalf of the Health Service, which were supported by the Attorney-General, were:- 
     
      
    274    (i) The Court is authorised, and indeed required, to adopt a purposive approach in interpreting the provisions of Div1B. 
     
      
    275    (ii) The legislative purpose of Div1B can be ascertained by reference to certain extrinsic materials. 
     
      
    276    (iii) The legislative purpose of Div1B, as ascertained by reference to those extrinsic materials, would be defeated in an important respect, if the Division was not interpreted so as to apply to the production of documents, as well as the adducing of evidence in the course of a hearing. 
     
      
    277    (iv) In order to fulfil the legislative purpose, the Court should interpret the provisions of Div1B so that they apply to the production of documents on subpoena, even if this means straining the ordinary meaning of the words the legislature chose or actually adding to the words the legislature chose. 
     
      
    278    It is necessary to consider in more detail the submissions made by the parties.  
     
      
    279    The first submission made on behalf of the appellant should be accepted. Indeed, it was not suggested by counsel for the Health Service or counsel for the Attorney-General that, if the words in Div1B were literally interpreted according to their ordinary, natural meaning, they would apply to the production of documents. The terms “adducing” (or cognate terms) and “evidence” are used repeatedly in s126H and also occur in s126I and s126J. Section 126K refers to the disclosure of evidence, the hearing of evidence in camera and the giving of evidence before the Court. As Black CJ and Sundberg said in their joint judgment in Esso (at p5) with respect to ss118 and 119 in Div1 of Pt310 of the Federal Evidence Act, both of which commence with the words “Evidence is not to be adduced”:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Sections 118 and 119 both prohibit the adducing of evidence of communications. To produce a document in a discovery context is not to adduce evidence. The plain meaning of the sections is that they prohibit the putting forward of a communication as evidence in Court”. 
        
       
      
    280    Although in Esso Black CJ and Sundberg J were referring to ss118 and 119 in Div1 of Pt310 of the Federal Act and to the discovery of documents and not the production of documents on subpoena, what they said is equally applicable to the provisions of Div1B in Pt310 of the New South Wales Act and to the production of documents on subpoena. 
     
      
    281    It must also be accepted that there is a distinction between the adducing of evidence and the discovery of documents or the production of documents on subpoena. Documents may have to be discovered or produced on subpoena, even though they would not be admissible in evidence. Furthermore, such documents, even if not admissible in evidence, may assist a party to whom the documents are discovered or produced, for example by leading to a train of enquiry. See Esso at pp6-7 per Black CJ and Sundberg J. 
     
      
    282    The second submission made on behalf of the appellant should also be accepted. As I have already stated, each of the three cases Telstra, Adsteam  and Akins was concerned with Div1 of Pt 310 of the relevant Act, which deals with client legal privilege. In each of the three cases it was held that the provisions of Div1 do not, on their true construction, apply to ancillary processes such as the production of documents in answer to subpoenas (Telstra at 278, Adsteam at 427 and Akins (by implication) at 546). 
     
      
    283    Furthermore, in Esso a majority of the Full Court of the Federal Court (Black CJ, Sundberg J and Finkelstein J) held that ss118 and 119, on their true construction, bear their ordinary literal meaning and do not apply to ancillary processes. However, it is to be noted that Black CJ and Sundberg J, after referring to the reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission (and especially para199 of the final report of the Australian Law Reform Commission), which led to the enactment of both the Federal Act and the New South Wales Act, concluded that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In our opinion the plain language of the sections is confirmed by the only directly relevant extrinsic material, which shows that Parliament intended the consequence that is said by the appellant to be anomalous. Especially when different views can be held about whether the consequence is anomalous on the one hand or acceptable or understandable on the other, the Court should be particularly careful that arguments based on anomaly or incongruity are not allowed to obscure the real intention, and choice, of the Parliament. For the above reasons we are unable to conclude that the operation of ss118 and 119 on a literal reading does not conform to the legislative purpose”. 
        
       
      
    284    The other member of the majority of the Court in Esso on this issue, Finkelstein J, relied on a number of reasons for reaching his conclusion that ss118 and 119, properly construed, did not apply to ancillary processes, including, apart from the language of the sections, the general scheme of Pt310, the extrinsic materials (the reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission) and that there was no “very clear indication” that the Parliament intended to impose greater restrictions than would be imposed by a literal interpretation of ss118 and 119 and that the purpose of ss118 and 119 was not “to protect from disclosure certain confidential communications” but “to ensure that evidence in respect of the topics dealt with is not to be adduced or given in a proceeding”. 
     
      
    285    The other two members of the Court in Esso (Merkel J, with whom Beaumont J agreed) dissented on this issue. At p38 Merkel J said inter alia:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…to confine the prohibition in ss118 and 119 to the adducing of evidence… and not extend it to the ancillary evidence gathering processes is inconsistent with the Act, is unreasonable and would tend to frustrate and defeat an important object and purpose of the amendments… put another way, it is implicit in the expressed prohibition in ss118 and 119 against evidence being adduced in respect of confidential communications that satisfy the “dominant purpose” test that the same test would apply in the Court’s ancillary processes for the purpose of determining the evidence to be adduced”. 
        
       
      
    286    Before dealing with the third submission made on behalf of the appellant, it is convenient to turn to the submissions made on behalf of the respondents. 
     
      
    287    In support of the submission that the Court is required to adopt a purposive approach in interpreting the provisions of Div1B, a number of authorities were cited.  
     
      
    288    Counsel for the Health Service relied particularly on some judicial pronouncements on statutory construction by McHugh J, particularly as a judge of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Kingston v Kiprose Pty Limited (1987) 11 NSWLR 404 and as a justice of the High Court in Saraswati v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 1. In Kingston v Kiprose at pp421-424 under the heading “Modern Approach to Statutory Construction” McHugh JA said inter alia:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Ascertaining the ordinary grammatical meaning of a legislative provision is only the first step in the process of statutory construction. If the consequences of the literal or grammatical construction raise a real doubt as to Parliament’s intent, the court is justified in refusing to give the words their literal or grammatical construction. 
        
       
       
       * * * 
       
       
        
        However, it is not only when words have been inadvertently used that a court is empowered to give a legislative provision a strained construction. A strained construction may be justified because words have been omitted. 
        
       
       
       * * * 
       
       
        
        As many of the cases show, the purpose of the legislation may require a meaning to be placed on the words of a particular provision which, standing alone, they cannot reasonably bear”. 
        
       
       
       * * * 
       
       
        
        In  
        Jones v Wrotham Park Settled Estates 
         [1980] AC 74, Lord Diplock said (at 105) that if the application of the literal or grammatical meaning would lead to results which would defeat the purpose of a statute the court may read words into the legislation. But his Lordship said that words could only be read into a statute if three conditions were fulfilled. First, the court must know the mischief with which the Act was dealing. Secondly, the court must be satisfied that by inadvertence Parliament has overlooked an eventuality which must be dealt with if the purpose of the Act is to be achieved. Thirdly, the court must be able to state with certainty what words Parliament would have used to overcome the omission if its attention had been drawn to the defect. 
        
       
       
       * * * 
       
       
        
        A purposive and not a literal approach is the method of statutory construction which now prevails. In most cases the grammatical meaning of a provision will give effect to the purpose of the legislation. A search for the grammatical meaning still constitutes the starting point. But if the grammatical meaning of a provision does not give effect to the purpose of the legislation, the grammatical meaning cannot prevail. It must give way to the construction which will promote the purpose or object of the Act. The  
        Acts Interpretation Act 
         1901 (Cth), s15AA and the  
        Interpretation Act 
         1987 (NSW), s33, both require this approach to statutory construction”. 
        
       
       
       * * * 
       
       
        
        Once the object or purpose of the legislation is delineated, the duty of the Court is to give effect to it in so far as, by addition or omission or clarification, the relevant provision is capable of achieving that purpose or object. Where the court can see the purpose of a provision from an examination of its terms, little difficulty should be met in giving effect to that purpose. The days are gone when judges, having identified the purpose of a particular statutory provision, can legitimately say, as Lord Macmillan said in  
        Inland Revenue Commissioners v Ayrshire Employers Mutual Insurance Associate Ltd 
         [1946] 1 All ER 637 at 641, of the means used to achieve the purpose: ‘The legislature has plainly missed fire’. Lord Diplock, in an extra judicial comment on that decision has said, that ‘if…the Courts can identify the target of Parliamentary legislation their proper function is to see that it is hit: not merely to record that it has been missed’: ‘The Courts As Legislators”,  
        The Lawyer and Justice (Sweet & Maxwell) 
         (1978) at 27. 
        
       
      
    289    This passage in the judgment of McHugh JA in Kingston v Kiprose was referred to with approval by Mason CJ, Deane J, Dawson J, Toohey J, Gaudron J and McHugh J in their joint judgment in Bropho v Western Australia (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 20. 
     
      
    290    In the part of his judgment in Kingston v Kiprose which I have quoted, McHugh JA referred to s33 of the New South Wales Interpretation Act. This section provides that a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying a statute is to be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object. 
     
      
    291    In the part of his judgment in Kingston v Kiprose which I have quoted, McHugh JA also referred to the speech of Lord Diplock in Jones v Wrotham Park Settled Estates which is in fact reported in (1980) AC as Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones. In his speech in Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones Lord Diplock stressed that the third condition for reading words into legislation is essential. His Lordship said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Unless this third condition is fulfilled any attempt by a court of justice to repair the omission in the Act cannot be justified as an exercise of its jurisdiction to determine what is the meaning of a written law which Parliament has passed. Such an attempt crosses the boundary between construction and legislation. It becomes a usurpation of a function which under the constitution of this country is vested in the legislature to the exclusion of the courts”. 
        
       
      
    292    In Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones itself Lord Diplock found that the third condition propounded by him was not satisfied. In the recent decision of the High Court in James Hardie & Coy Pty Limited v Seltsam Pty Limited (1998) 73 ALJR 238, Kirby J at par73 referred to Lord Diplock’s speech in Wentworth Securities Ltd v Jones and said that Lord Diplock’s approach to statutory construction now prevails throughout the common law world. His Honour added:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Today, unless driven to the result by unyielding words, no judicial satisfaction is to be derived from concluding that the manifest target of legislation has been missed”. 
        
       
       
      In  
      Saraswati v The Queen 
       McHugh J said at p21:- 
       
        
        “In many cases, the grammatical or literal meaning of a statutory provision will give effect to the purpose of the legislation. Consequently, it will constitute the ‘ordinary meaning’ to be applied. If, however, the literal or grammatical meaning of the provision does not give effect to that purpose, that meaning cannot be regarded as ‘the ordinary meaning’ and cannot prevail. It must give way to the construction which will promote the underlying purpose or object of an Act:  
        Interpretation Act 
        , s33. In  
        Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation  
        (1981) 147 CLR 297 at 321, Mason and Wilson JJ said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘when the judge labels the operation of the statute as ‘absurd’, ‘extraordinary’, capricious’, ‘irrational’ or ‘obscure’ he assigns a ground for concluding that the legislature could not have intended such an operation and that an alternative interpretation must be preferred. But the propriety of departing from the literal interpretation is not confined to situations described by these labels. It extends to any situation in which for good reason the operation of the statute on a literal reading does not conform to the legislative intent as ascertained from the provisions of the statute, including the policy which may be discerned from those provisions’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Moreover, once a court concludes that the literal or grammatical meaning of a provision does not conform to the legislative purpose as ascertained from the statute as a whole including the policy which may be discerned from its provisions, it is entitled to give effect to that purpose by addition to, omission from, or clarification of, the particular provision.” 
        
       
       
      In  
      Saraswati  
      Toohey J agreed with McHugh J’s judgment. 
       
      
    293    Counsel for the Health Service referred to CIC Insurance Limited v Bankstown Football Club Limited (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408, where Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gummow JJ said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is well settled that at common law, apart from any reliance upon s15AB of the  
        Acts Interpretation Act 
         1901 (Cth), the court may have regard to reports of law reform bodies to ascertain the mischief which a statute is intended to cure. Moreover, the modern approach to statutory interpretation (a) insists that the context be considered in the first instance, not merely at some later stage when ambiguity might be thought to arise, and (b) uses ‘context’ in its widest sense to include such things as the existing state of the law and the mischief which, by legitimate means such as those just mentioned, one may discern the statute was intended to remedy”. 
        
       
      
    294    This passage in the joint judgment in CIC Insurance Limited was quoted by McHugh J in his judgment in Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd (1997) 191 CLR 85 at 112-13. His Honour then proceeded to sound a cautionary note, saying at p113:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Extrinsic material cannot be used to construe a legislative provision unless the construction of the provision suggested by that material is one that is ‘reasonably open’. Even if extrinsic material convincingly indicates the evil at which a section was aimed, it does not follow that the language of the section will always permit a construction that will remedy that evil. If the legislature uses language which covers only one state of affairs, a court cannot legitimately construe the words of the section in a tortured and unrealistic manner to cover another set of circumstances. As Brennan CJ and I said in  
        IW v City of Perth 
         (1997) 191 CLR 1 at 12, even when a court adopts a purposive construction to remedial legislation it ‘is not at liberty to give it a construction that is unreasonable or unnatural’”. 
        
       
      
    295    Nevertheless, in Newcastle City Council v GIO McHugh J found that each of Lord Diplock’s three conditions were satisfied and accordingly words which were not expressed in s40 of the Insurance Contracts Act (Commonwealth) could be read into the section. 
     
      
    296    In order to ascertain the legislature’s purpose in enacting a piece of legislation a court can have regard to the terms of the legislation itself and to various extrinsic materials, including the materials expressly referred to in ss(2) of s34 of the Interpretation Act. Such materials include any relevant report of a committee of inquiry or similar body (para(b)), any explanatory note or memorandum relating to the Bill for the Act (para(e)) and the Second reading speech of the Minister on moving that the Bill for the Act be read a second time (para(f)). 
     
      
    297    In the present appeal counsel for the Health Service relied particularly on the Second reading speech made by the Attorney General in the Legislative Council on 22 October 1997 in moving that the Evidence Amendment (Confidential Communications) Bill be read a second time. The Attorney General commenced his speech by saying:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It goes without saying that a person who has suffered the grave trauma of sexual assault will often be assisted in recovery by seeking counselling. The counselling relationship, built on confidentiality, privacy and trust, enables a victim to explore major issues concerning her sense of safety, privacy and self-esteem. The knowledge that details of a victim’s conversations with her therapist may be used against her in subsequent criminal proceedings can inhibit the counselling process and undermine its efficacy. One counsellor has said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘When I have told clients that the counselling notes of our session may be subpoenaed I have had experience of clients leaving counselling, and in another case a client deliberately censored herself in discussing issues in counselling’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Knowing that a perpetrator has had access to counselling files can further traumatise victims and increase their sense of powerlessness. One victim said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘My files were subpoenaed. It wasn’t the court seeing them, the judge and the lawyers, that worried me so much because I knew that they could only support my case if I was given a chance to speak about them. What made me feel really upset was that my stepfather, who had raped me, would see them. He was lying about not having done it and I could just imagine him going through my personal records. It was like having him invade my life again’”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    298    Later in his speech the Attorney General dealt with the arguments in favour of a specialised sexual assault communications privilege. The first two arguments mentioned were that the general privilege in Div1A of the Bill would not sufficiently protect sexual assault communications and that the primary purpose of counselling is not investigative but therapeutic. The further arguments were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Thirdly, it was argued that the failure to accord counselling records a privilege has had the following consequences: 
        
       
       
        
        some victims choose not to obtain counselling; 
        
       
       
        
        some obtain counselling but are guarded about what they reveal; 
        
       
       
        
        some victims refuse to report the crime or be a witness for the prosecution; 
        
       
       
        
        some counsellors do not take notes; 
        
       
       
        
        some counsellors take notes which are cryptic and cannot be understood by others; and 
        
       
       
        
        some counsellors refuse to hand over the notes and are charged with contempt. 
        
       
       
        
        These are undesirable outcomes. Where a victim refuses to initiate court proceedings or undergo counselling, or to the extent to which the openness of the counselling relationship is constrained, both the interests of the victim and the interests of the community in general are harmed. 
        
       
       
        
        Fourthly, many of the submissions suggested that defence counsel are increasingly using subpoenas for the production of counselling records as a weapon to intimidate the complainant. This is not a justifiable use of the laws of evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Finally, a common concern expressed in the submissions related to the fact that being a victim of sexual assault can be a humiliating and/or terrifying experience. It was argued that allowing the accused and the defence counsel to have access to all the victim’s thoughts, feelings, insecurities and the recounting of painful past experiences as revealed in counselling sessions may exacerbate this trauma. 
        
       
       
        
        In the light of these arguments, I propose in this legislation to supplement the general provision with a more specific privilege. It will presume that things said in confidence by a victim of sexual assault to her counsellor (and notes of such communications) are inadmissible as evidence. The onus will be placed on the defence to argue that any such material will substantially assist in the defence of an accused and that such evidence cannot be obtained from alternative sources. The value of the information to the defence will have to substantially outweigh both the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of sexual assault counselling relationships and the risk of harm to the complainant that may be caused by disclosure. Only those parts which meet the test will be disclosed to the defence and the judge will be able to prevent the disclosure to the accused of details which might identify the complainant’s whereabouts”. 
        
       
      
    299    Counsel for the Health Service also relied on part of the explanatory note for the Evidence Amendment (Confidential Communications) Bill 1997. The explanatory note said in part:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Creation of the new categories of privilege for these kinds of confidential communications will also provide a ground for a person to object to the production of a document by subpoena on the ground that to do so would disclose such a communication”. 
        
       
      
    300    Counsel also made reference to a discussion paper of June 1996 headed “Protecting confidential communications from disclosure in court proceedings”, which was referred to by the Attorney General in his Second reading speech. This discussion paper includes the following paragraphs:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1.2 Most recently, attention was focussed on the issue by the resistance of a social worker to compliance with a subpoena in a sexual assault case. The client notes containing confidential communications to a rape crisis counsellor were handed over (in a locked brief case) to the Queanbeyan Local Court after the social worker spent four hours in the lock up. The magistrate at the committal hearing decided that the matter should be determined by the trial judge. 
         
         
        4.12 There is a concern that certain of the relationships concerned fail to operate effectively without a privilege, particularly in relation to communications specifically made in contemplation of litigation. An example where litigation is in contemplation is sexual assault counsellors and their clients. Anecdotal evidence supports the view that clients have left counselling and/or withdrawn their complaint when informed that the notes of counselling sessions may be subpoenaed. In other cases, clients have censored themselves, to the detriment of the counselling relationship. Evidence in the USA supports the view that clients who know their files may be used in evidence will seek anonymity and/or refuse counselling.” 
         
        
       
      
    301    After this survey of the extrinsic materials for ascertaining the purpose of Div1B, counsel for the Health Service submitted that the clear purpose of Div1B was to strictly limit disclosure, whether to a court or to the person alleged to have committed the sexual assault, of confidential sexual assault counselling communications made by the victim of the alleged assault, that that purpose w",1999-07-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

     70052/98 - Regina v Elizabeth Anne BURDIS 
      
      
      
     REASONS FOR VERDICT 
      
      
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: On 18 June instant Elizabeth Anne Burdis, [“the accused”], was presented for trial in this Court upon an indictment containing three counts. 
    2   The first count in the indictment charges the accused with having murdered her father, Ronald John Burdis, on 29 March 1998 at Rous. In order to establish this charge, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt all of the following: 
     
      
     (i) The death in fact of Mr. Burdis; 
      
      
     (ii) An act of the accused causing such death; 
      
      
     (iii) An accompanying intent of any of the kinds stipulated in section 18(1)(a) of the  
     Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) 
     . 
      
    3   The second count in the indictment charges that the accused at the same time and place wounded her mother, Dorothy Edna Burdis, with intent to murder her. In order to establish this charge, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt all of the following: 
     
      
     (i) A wounding in fact of Mrs. Burdis; 
      
      
     (ii) An act of the accused causing such wounding; 
      
      
     (iii) An accompanying intent to murder, being any of the types of intent nominated in section 18(1)(a) of the  
     Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) 
     . 
      
    4   The third count in the indictment charges the accused with having maliciously wounded, at the same time and place, her sister, Helen Margaret Burdis. In order to establish this charge, the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt all the following: 
     
      
     (i) A wounding in fact of Miss Burdis; 
      
      
     (ii) An act of the accused causing such wounding; 
      
      
     (iii) Accompanying malice in the accused. 
      
     The accused, upon arraingnment, pleaded not guilty to each of those three charges. 
      
      
    5   On 18 March 1999 the accused signed a document purporting to be an election made pursuant to section 32(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The document is Exhibit B in the present proceedings. I am satisfied, and was so satisfied at the time of the arraignment of the accused, that all relevant requirements of section 32(1) of that Act have been complied with. I proceeded, therefore, on Friday last to try the accused in the absence of a jury. 
    6   No oral evidence was adduced at the trial, it being agreed by the learned Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor and by learned counsel for the accused that the trial should proceed upon the basis of agreed documents.  
    7   One of those documents is a statement of facts, which is in evidence as Exhibit C. It says all that needs to be said by way of summarising the relevant objective facts, and I therefore reproduce it as follows: 
     
      
       
       “About 7.55 pm on the 29 March, 1998 the accused was in her bedroom of her parents home at a property at 322 Rous Road, Rous. Also in the dwelling was her father Ronald John Burdis, 67 years old, her mother Dorothy Edna Burdis, 62 years old, her sister Helen Margaret Burdis, 24 years old and the accused’s daughter Elizabeth Sharlot Burdis who is 9 years of age. The accused’s mother Dorothy went into the kitchen to prepare herself some food and noticed that food she had prepared earlier had been eaten. Mrs. Burdis commented loudly about the accused having eaten the food. At this point the accused left her bedroom and walked to the kitchen area. The accused then selected a knife approximately 15 centimetres in length from the kitchen area and then walked into the loungeroom. At this stage the accused’s mother was standing facing away from the accused. The accused walked up behind her mother Dorothy and commenced to stab her with great force in the upper right side of her back. The accused delivered at least four stab wounds which went right through her mothers back exiting the front of her shoulder. Mrs. Dorothy Burdis then collapsed forward with blood flowing profusely from the knife wounds. The accused’s father Ronald Burdis then came to the assistance of his wife and attempted to take hold of his daughter by the arms. The accused then stabbed her father with the knife in the upper chest area. Mr. Burdis collapsed on the floor having been fatally wounded by the knife wound. Two wounds were later observed one on the upper left side of the chest and one on the upper right side of the deceased. The accused’s sister Helen Margaret Burdis then came to assist her mother and father and at this point the accused raised the knife at her sister and said, “Do you want some too?”. The accused then stabbed her sister in the chest area, the blade deflected off the sternum and punctured her lung. Helen Burdis then yelled out to the accused’s daughter Elizabeth, 9 years old to run from the house to across the road to a neighbours to get help. Both Mrs. Dorothy Burdis and Helen Burdis then managed to leave the house to the front verandah to ensure the safety of the child. At this stage the accused calmly walked back into the kitchn and went to the sink and washed blood from the knife and her hands. Her father remained lying deceased on the loungeroom floor. The accused then rang the ambulance and openly declared that the ambulance was required as she had stabbed three people. Ambulance and Police arrived a short time later and the accused was spoken to. Ambulance officers then conveyed Mrs. Dorothy Burdis and Helen Burdis to Lismore Base Hospital for treatment. Mrs. Dorothy Burdis was in a serious but stable condition having lost a considerable amount of blood and Mrs. Helen Burdis was transported by helicopter to Brisbane Hospital with a punctured lung. The accused was spoken to firstly at the scene and then interviewed by electronic interview at Lismore Police Station.” 
       
      
    8   A considerable volume of additional documentary material was placed before the Court in connection with the relevant objective facts and circumstances surrounding the offences charged in all three counts of the indictment. I have read and considered the whole of that material; and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proved the actus reus charged in each of the three counts. The contrary was not contended at the trial. 
    9   The only issue that was raised at the trial was whether the accused’s case falls within section 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. That section is, so far as is at present relevant, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “If, in an indictment ……………….. , an act ………………….is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done………………., then, if it appears ………….., that the person did the act ……………… charged, but was mentally ill at the time when the person did ……………… the same, ………..( 
       the tribunal of fact at the trial)  
       ………………..must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.” 
       
      
    10   The onus of proof of the fact of mental illness as thus defined rests upon the accused. The relevant standard of proof is proof on the balance of probabilities. 
    11   The law relating to this special defence of mental illness is well established. It was stated, in its fundamental form, as long ago as 1843 and in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “Was the accused at the time the offence was committed suffering from a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind such as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong.”  
       Regina v McNaughton  
       (1843) 8 ER 718 at 722 
       . 
       
      
    12   As to the concept of knowledge in an accused person of the wrongfulness of the relevant act, the foundational principle is stated as follows by the High Court of Australia in Sodeman v R (1943) 55 CLR 192 at 215: 
     
      
       
       “If the disease so governs the faculties that it is impossible to reason with some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he is doing he is prevented from knowing what he does is wrong.” 
       
      
    13   Such is the relevant law. As to the relevant facts, I have had regard, in particular, to four reports provided by four different expert witnesses in the field of psychiatry.  
    14   Dr. Igor Petroff has been treating the accused since June 1989. His report is Exhibit D in the present proceedings. His conclusions are expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
       “ 
       Opinion 
       
      
      
       
       Elizabeth Burdis is an intellectually dull woman who suffers from  
       Chronic Schizophrenia  
        for the past 14 years. Her illness was such that she could never be without medication and would relapse as soon as it was stopped. Prior to the tragedy in March, Elizabeth had become chaotic with her medication and had relapsed again. This previously kind and gentle woman whose hobby in childhood was dressing up guinea pigs, could only have been psychotic to have attacked her family and particularly her father, of whom she was very fond, and who was her closest ally. 
       
      
      
       
       Besides her psychosis, there were no predictive factors indicative of dangerousness. 
       
      
      
       
       There is a very strong clinical impression that whilst novel anti-psychotics produce superior results, when patients stop them, their psychosis are much more florid and bizarre. At the time that I last saw Elizabeth Burdis this was not evident, but my contact with the Prison Hospital indicated that Elizabeth was very floridly psychotic.” 
       
      
    15   Dr. Michael Giuffrida is a Consultant Psychiatrist at the Mullawa Correctional Centre. Dr. Giuffrida has submitted a report, which is Exhibit E in the present proceedings. Dr. Giuffrida notes in his report that he did not have, at the time of writing the report, relevant hospital discharge summaries; any report from Dr. Petroff; or any other relevant documents. Subject to those limitations, Dr. Giuffrida’s own view was that at the time of his examination of the accused, which appears to have been in April 1998, the accused: 
     
      
       
       “(a)lthough she is obviously quite psychotic and has committed a serious crime……… is probably not presently mentally ill within the meaning of the  
       Mental Health Act NSW 1990 
       , because she does not represent a serious harm to herself or others at this time.” 
       
      
    16   Dr. Giuffrida does, however, conclude his report as follows: 
     
      
       
       “I have explained to Ms Burdis that the local Court has requested a psychiatric report from me and I thought that it would be in her interest to provide such a report to the court  
       on the basis that she was undoubtedly in my opinion suffering from an acute psycyhotic illlness at the time of the offence and in my view probably not able to exercise rational judgment 
       .” [emphasis added] 
       
      
    17   Dr. Robert Delaforce submitted at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions a report dated 14 March 1999. This report is a lengthy and carefully crafted one, and I have found it of great assistance for present purposes. Dr. Delaforce expresses his agreement with the diagnosis made by Dr. W. Lucas to whose report I shall refer presently. Dr. Delaforce expresses his support for the proposition that the accused was at the material time mentally ill in the sense contemplated by section 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Proceedings) Act. More particularly, Dr. Delaforce expresses these views: 
     
      
       
       “Her active features of Schizophrenia at the time of the offences result in a defect of reason caused by disease of the mind. She seemed to know what she was doing at the time of the offences, stabbing her parents and her sister Helen. However, this was clouded by her talk of all 3 being “robots” at the time of the stabbing. Also she knew that it was wrong to stab them. However, because of her active Schizophrenia at the time of the offences she was incapable of reasoning with some degree of calmness as to the wrongness of the acts or of comprehending the nature or significance of the acts.” 
       
      
      
     And later: 
      
      
       
       “In short, at the time of the offences she felt under threat of her own life and was given advice about how to stab her parents and sister, advice or influence that may have partly derived from auditory hallucinations, such that overall she had irrational beliefs and could not reason appropriately about the wrongness of the acts of stabbing or comprehend the nature of those acts.” 
       
      
    18   Dr. William Lucas submitted to the accused’s solicitor a report dated 7 March 1999. It is sufficient for present purposes to quote Dr. Lucas’ opinion, which is as follows: 
     
      
       
       “I believe Ms Burdis has the defence of mental illness to the charges. At the time of the stabbing she was suffering from a defect of reason due to a disease of the mind, chronic paranoid schizophrenia. As a result, although she knew the physical nature and quality of her acts, she was unable to reason about them with a moderate degree of sense and composure. She believed she had no choice in what she did. She gave me many reasons for her actions and, with the exception of her anger at being accused of gluttony, all these were of a delusional nature and, importantly, a number were concerned with beliefs that her daughter was being sexually abused and prostituted. Her father was not the initial target in the attacks but he was the only one to die. Ms Burdis had elaborate delusional beliefs about his behaviour and activities and she had been thinking for weeks about stabbing him along with her mother and sister. 
       
      
      
       
       Ms Burdis will require long term psychiatric treatment and this needs to be received in a hospital as a forensic patient with oversight by the Mental Health Review Tribunal. Although she has not offended violently before, the nature of her illness and her actions on the day in question are such that lengthy inpatient treatment is likely to be necessary.” 
       
      
    19   I accept the whole of the body of expert evidence that I have summarised from the four reports which are, respectively, Exhibits D, E, S and T in the present proceedings. 
    20   I am comfortably satisfied on the probabilities that the accused has made good the proposition that, as to each of the offences charged against her in the indictment, she is not guilty by reason of mental illness in the sense for which provision is made by section 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1990 (NSW). I return, as to each count in the indictment, a special verdict in those terms. 
    21   Section 39 of that same statute requires that, a special verdict having been returned in terms of section 38, there be made an order that the accused “be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law”. 
    22   The accused is, and has been for some time, detained in the Bunya Unit of the Cumberland Hospital. She was arrested on 29 March 1998, and has been treated by the authorities as a mental patient since that date. It seems that she has been treated as a forensic patient since some later date. I was informed that there is no impediment to her continued detention at the Bunya Unit of the Cumberland Hospital. I order therefore, and pursuant to Section 39 of the Mental Health (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1900, that the accused be detained at the Bunya Unit of the Cumberland Hospital as a forensic patient, and until released by due process of law. 
    23   It is important to explain for the public information generally, but in particular for the information of the members of the accused’s immediate family, that the special verdicts which the Court has returned, and the consequential detention order which the Court has made, do not entail that the accused will simply walk free in the way that happens when an accused person is found not guilty by a verdict other than a special verdict dependent upon a finding of mental illness. What will happen in the wake of the order made by this Court is that the accused will become a forensic patient in the sense contemplated by the Mental Health Act 1990; and she will be dealt with in the manner for which provision is made in the detailed statutory scheme that is set out in Chapter 5 of that Act. Put very simply, that means that the accused will come under the constant supervision and monitoring of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, a body constituted by section 252 of the Act, and in such a way as to bring together a representative body of legal, and of psychiatric, expertise, and of appropriate general community experience. The relevant legislation entails, put simply, that the accused will not be released back into the general community without the Tribunal’s having first made a positive finding, based upon credible evidence, that she is no longer a danger to any member of the community. Even if some such recommendation be made in due time, the accused will be released back into the community, again speaking simply and in the context of the present particular case, subject to appropriate conditions which will be appropriately monitored. 
    24   There is one remaining matter that calls for the attention of the Court. It concerns Exhibit U, which is a four-page document prepared for the information of the Court by Miss Helen Burdis, the accused’s sister and the person named as the victim in the third count in the indictment. 
    25   The document is, essentially, what would be described these days as a ‘victim impact statement’. The document opens, in part, with this statement: 
     
      
       
       “I understand that, in making this statement, there is little likelihood in making any impact in the outcome of this trial, however I feel strongly that there be an opportunity for the family’s voice to be heard.” 
       
      
    26   It is, of course, the case that such a statement cannot influence, as a matter of law, the outcome of the trial of the accused. It is, however, my view that Miss Burdis is entitled to put her document forward for the information of the Court; and is entitled, more importantly, to have it treated with a respectful seriousness by the Court. The detail of what the document says is heart-rending. For my own part, I cannot bring myself to say the usual trite and conventional things, such as that I can well imagine the anguish and the sense of loss and the familial de-stabilisation of which the document speaks. I think that the proper course is simply to receive, and to acknowledge, the contents of the document; to express sincere condolences to Miss Burdis and the other members of her immediate family; and to express the sincere hope that time will, at least to some extent, assuage the grief that the document so graphically and so movingly expresses. 
    27   I presume to say one further thing, which, ordinarily, I would not say. It is this: that I express the hope that the media will be properly respectful of the grief and distress, and of the overwhelming sense of frustration and incomprehension, that are being experienced by the surviving members of the Burdis family, not the least important of whom is a little girl aged some 10 years; and that the media will, in consideration of those matters, report the present trial, if indeed it needs to be reported at all, with a decent restraint.

     REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
      
      
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: Before the Court for sentence is a young girl who was born on 1 July 1982. The offence in respect of which she stands for sentence was committed on or about 12 March 1997. She was aged, therefore, 14 years and not quite 9 months at the time of the offence; and she is now aged a few days short of 17 years. She is, therefore, and was at all material times, a “child” as defined in the Children (Criminal Proceedings Act) 1987. The provisions of that Act are, therefore, applicable to the present proceedings. Having regard to the provisions of section 11 of that Act, I propose to refer to her either by her initials or as “the young person”. I take note of, and draw attention to, the provisions of section 11(1) and (5) of the Act. 
    2   On 19 March 1999 the young person was arraigned before Barr J of this Court sitting at Lismore. There was presented against her an indictment charging that on or about 12th March 1997 she had been an accessory after the fact to a murder, on or about 9 March 1997 and at Casino, by one Adam John Bowhay of one Steven Lindsay Jarvis. The young person pleaded guilty upon such arraignment, and Barr J recorded, accordingly, judgment of conviction. His Honour remanded the young person for sentence to this Court on Thursday last 18 June instant. For administrative reasons the Court was not able to deal with the matter until Friday last 19 June instant, when the Court heard all necessary evidence and submissions in connection with sentence. 
    3   The young person was arrested on 20 March 1997. She was thereafter in custody until 21 April 1997 when she was admitted to bail by a Judge of this Court. Thereafter, and until today, the young person has been at liberty on conditional bail. The bail conditions as originally set are in evidence as Exhibit 2 in the proceedings on sentence. It is not necessary to refer to their fine detail, it being sufficient to understand that they were, in comparative terms, onerous conditions, and that the young person has complied strictly with them throughout the period of her liberty on bail. 
    4   The relevant objective facts can be stated shortly, and in terms drawn substantially from a lengthy recorded interview between the investigating police and the young person, which interview took place on 21 March 1997 at Wangaratta in Victoria. 
    5   It thus appears that in March 1997, and for a period of about 8 months previously, the young person had been in what is described these days conventionally, if somewhat euphemistically, as a “relationship” with the previously mentioned Adam Bowhay. He was then aged about 19 years, and she was then aged, as I have earlier noted, somewhat less than 15 years. They were both described in various of the submissions put to the Court on Friday last as having been, at the material times, “out of control”. I think that is an entirely appropriate description of their then situation. 
    6   It seems that they had travelled together to Byron Bay where they had stolen a car in which they had driven through Beaudesert to Kyogle in order to visit a friend of R.A.F. Having spent a night at the home of the friend, they set off again, but the vehicle in which they were travelling broke down, and so they hitch-hiked to Casino. They had very little in the way of money or other possessions; they were not familiar with Casino; and the time at which they were dropped off in Casino was in the vicinity of 9.00 pm to 9.30 pm. They were sitting outside the Commonwealth Bank in Casino and contemplating, as I infer, what their next moves might be. It was then that the eventual victim, the late Mr. Jarvis, came upon the scene. Mr. Jarvis apparently lived alone in a room at the Commercial Hotel in Casino. When he came upon the young person and Adam Bowhay, he was apparently intoxicated. He invited R.A.F. and Bowhay to have a drink with him, and they agreed to do so. They went in company to the Oxford Hotel in Casino, where they had something to drink, and where they socialised for a time. It seems that Bowhay and R.A.F. told Mr. Jarvis that they were without accommodation, and that they were looking to sleep in a park. He asked whether they would like to come back to his room at the Commercial Hotel, and that is what happened. In Mr. Jarvis’ room, the three of them appear to have had some desultory conversation for a time. According to the young person, and perhaps significantly in the light of what subsequently occurred, Mr. Jarvis: 
     
      
       
       “…….. was talking about, saying, saying I’m his baby, I’m his baby, I’m his baby not Adam’s baby, and that, saying me and Adam were clowns. Um - what else? Nothin’ much else. Just about, you know, just saying, How long have youse been goin’ out for and that.” 
       
      
    7   Eventually, although it is not clear at whose particular instigation, it was agreed that the three of them would go for a walk to a nearby park. They did so, and at or in the near vicinity of the park a fight broke out between Mr. Jarvis and Adam Bowhay. What happened, put shortly, was that Adam Bowhay bashed and stabbed Mr. Jarvis to death in the most appallingly brutal fashion. According to R.A.F., she did not actually see the killing, she then being some five or so metres distant from the two men, and deliberately ignoring the progress of the fight between them. That there was in fact a fight going on between the two men was certainly known to her: first, because she heard Mr. Jarvis crying out to Bowhay not to hurt him; and secondly, because, at one point during the fight, she saw Mr. Jarvis “spinnin’ around ……….. just like, um, like you look like when you get punched in the head………….. and spin around”.  
    8   The young person and Bowhay subsequently left the scene of the killing and returned to Mr. Jarvis’ room, from which they stole a travel bag and some $12.50 in money. They hitch-hiked thereafter from Casino to a small town called Whiporie; and from Whiporie to Wauchope, where they stole another motor vehicle and travelled down to the Central Coast. They there visited R.A.F’s mother and uncle. The uncle showed R.A.F. a newspaper report of the death of Mr. Jarvis. According to R.A.F., this was the first knowledge she had that Mr. Jarvis had not only been bashed, but had been killed, by Adam Bowhay. R.A.F’s uncle gave her some money which she in turn passed on to Bowhay to use in order to buy petrol for the car that he and she were then using, and cigarettes.  
    9   R.A.F. and Bowhay thereafter travelled to Victoria where, eventually, they were arrested and extradited to this State. 
    10   As I have earlier stated, but the fact will bear repeating, the killing of Mr. Jarvis was a callous and brutal crime. Adam Bowhay was brought to trial in December 1998 upon a charge of having murdered Mr. Jarvis. He pleaded not guilty, and appears to have based his defence, essentially, upon diminished responsibility in the sense recognised by section 23A of the Crimes Act 1900. On 4 December 1998 the jury at trial returned a verdict finding him guilty as charged. He was sentenced by Dunford J on 17 December 1998 to penal servitude for 23 years, made up of a minimum term of 16 years and an additional term of 7 years. 
    11   It is, therefore, clear that the accessorial crime to which R.A.F. had pleaded guilty was ancillary to a principal crime of great objective criminality. If one accepts her own version of events, - as I am disposed to do, there being no evidence to the contrary, - she did not realise until some time after the event that Adam Bowhay had not only bashed Mr. Jarvis, but had in fact bashed and stabbed him to death. It is true that R.A.F’s own actual assistance to him does not seem to have extended beyond obtaining some material assistance from her uncle; and thereafter assisting and encouraging Bowhay in the sense that she continued to give him the support and encouragement of a continuing “relationship”. These were positive acts of assistance; they tended to assist Bowhay to avoid justice; it is clear, as the plea of guilty itself acknowledges, that such was R.A.F.’s intention, she then knowing that what Adam Bowhay had done to Mr. Jarvis extended beyond an assault to an actual killing. 
    12   I emphasise these matters because, as will appear presently, R.A.F’s particular situation has about it subjective features of a very compelling kind; and they must be brought to proper account as the law requires. That makes it all the more important to ensure that nobody, and particularly not R.A.F. herself, runs away with the idea that what she herself did is not, in purely objective terms, particularly serious. An accessory after the fact to a crime of murder is liable, by reason of the provisions of section 349(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, to a maximum penalty of penal servitude for 25 years. That provision makes unmistakably clear the gravity with which Parliament, as representative of the community at large, regards the offence for which R.A.F. is now to be sentenced. 
    13   The statutory provisions to which I have just referred have a direct bearing upon the applicability in principle, and the application in fact, of the ameliorative provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, in the case of a person convicted of having been an accessory after the fact to a murder. Such an accessorial offence is a “serious indictable offence” as defined in section 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. That being so, the offender is required, by section 17 of that Act, to be “dealt with according to law”. Of course, that does not entail that the entirety of the ameliorative provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act is withdrawn from an offender who has committed a “serious indictable offence”; and, in particular and importantly for present purposes, the general principles that are stated in section 6 of that Act continue to apply. It follows, therefore, that this Court is obliged, when exercising its present jurisdiction in R.A.F’s case, to have regard to those section 6 principles, which are stated in the following terms: 
     
      
       
       “(a) That children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them; 
       
      
      
       
       (b) That children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance; 
       
      
      
       
       (c) That it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption; 
       
      
      
       
       (d) That it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home;  
       
      
      
       
       (e) That the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.” 
       
      
    14   As I have previously said, the subjective features of the young person’s case are compelling. In summarising them as follows, I rely in large part upon the pre-sentence report prepared by Mrs. Cheryl Latu, a Juvenile Justice Counsellor with the Central Coast office of Juvenile Justice Community Services. That report is in evidence as Exhibit 1 in the proceedings on sentence. The contents of the report were supplemented by oral evidence from Mrs. Latu. I found Mrs. Latu a convincing witness, and I accept her evidence. The whole of that material is supplemented further by some brief evidence that was given by R.A.F. herself. It was brief, and not particularly articulate, evidence; but I accept it in the terms in which it was given. 
    15   As previously noted, the young person is at present aged not quite 17 years. Her personal history to date has been a sadly troubled one. Her natural father was killed in a road accident when she was aged only 1 year. Thereafter, her widowed mother’s own domestic situation was itself unstable and productive of real problems for the young person as she moved into adolescence. The sad, although not surprising, results of this personal and domestic instability were of a kind with which the Court is all too familiar: a general deterioration of personal behaviour; a virtually complete breakdown in personal discipline; a wilful rebellion against all forms of authority, whether in the home or at school; and a steady drift into the orbit of an unsavoury peer group. When R.A.F. was aged about 13 years, she experienced an incident of sexual abuse by a stranger; and this reinforced, not surprisingly, the other personal and societal problems to which I have referred. 
    16   Since her arrest and subsequent admission to bail, R.A.F. has attempted, with a great deal of assistance from the Juvenile Justice authorities and with some success, to rehabilitate and to stabilise her personal situation. She has broken off her “relationship” with Adam Bowhay. She has established a home of her own with another young man, of whom the Court knows nothing except that they seem to have established a reasonably stable home; that they have a baby son born in December 1998 and to whom they are both, apparently, devoted; and that she has active and useful support from her mother and from her paternal grandparents and maternal grandmother. 
    17   R.A.F. has not had much in the way of stable employment in the past; but she has had some such employment, and she appears to have been well motivated and diligent in it. She is conscious of her lack of education, and is both willing and able to do what she can in order to improve that position. In that regard she has been counselled and supported by the Juvenile Justice authorities; and she appears both to have made some worthwhile progress in the past, and to have in a real sense future prospects of continuing that progress. 
    18   R.A.F pleaded guilty, as I accept, at the first available opportunity; and she is entitled, in accordance with well established principle, to proper consideration in that regard. She has criminal antecedents; but I do not regard them as having significant adverse weight in the present sentencing context. I am satisfied, - although I say it in a spirit of cautious optimism rather than of unqualified conviction, - that she is not likely to commit in the future serious breaches of the law. 
    19   I have not found it easy to bring into what I regard as a just and proper balance the objective and the subjective matters to which I have earlier herein referred. I do not regard R.A.F’s offence as being at all an insubstantial offence in terms of its objective criminality. A person who gives comfort and encouragement to a known killer to the end of assisting that person to escape his just desserts, does something that has the potential to subvert the proper maintenance of the rule of law, the paramount objective of which must always be to maintain the sanctity of human life.  
    20   It is, however, the case that no Court can fail to be conscious of the extreme youth of R.A.F; and to be conscious, therefore, of the need to be properly concerned not to deal with her on the present occasion in a way so heavy-handed as to negate her prospects, which I think to be real and substantial prospects, of rehabilitation. Nor am I unmindful of the situation of R.A.F’s baby. It is no easy thing to deal now with R.A.F in such a fashion as would entail of necessity that that little child would spend some of its most important formative years deprived of the nurture, in a stable domestic environment, of his own mother.  
    21   I have come to the conclusion that it would be proper, in the circumstances as I have previously outlined them of this particular case, to deal with R.A.F in the manner for which provision is made by section 558 of the Crimes Act 1900. Such course seems to me to have the following proper advantages: first, it respects the integrity of the conviction actually recorded by Barr J on 19 March last; secondly, it affords R.A.F every proper opportunity and encouragement to break with her past and to make something worthwhile of her future; and thirdly, it leaves open as a real, - and it is to be hoped, an effective, - sanction the imposition of a gaol sentence in the event that R.A.F throws away the opportunity thus given to her by the Court. 
    22   I order, therefore, and pursuant to section 558 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), that the passing of sentence upon R.A.F be deferred, and that she be released upon her entering into a recognisance , without sureties, and in the amount of $500, to be of good behaviour for a period of 4 years from today’s date, and to come up for sentence at any time within that period if so required by the Court. The recognisance to which the order refers is subject to the following conditions: 
     
      
     1. The young person is to accept throughout the entire period of the recognisance the supervision and counselling of the Juvenile Justice Community Services branch of the Department of Juvenile Justice. 
      
      
     2. The young person is to attend from time to time, as may be required by any Juvenile Justice Counsellor who is assigned to supervise her case, such counselling as may be required by such Counsellor. 
      
      
     3. The young person is to take part, participating in every reasonable way, in any group or other programme nominated by such Counsellor. 
      
      
     4. The young person is to reside at such place or places as may be either directed or approved from time to time,by such Counsellor. 
      
      
     5. The young person is to undertake with all reasonable diligence any educational, or vocational training, course nominated by such Counsellor.  
      
      
     6. The young person is to have such contacts as may be required by her Counsellor with any appropriate community worker or social worker in connection with the planning and the implementation of any community-based-plan designed for her. 
      
      
     7. The young person will work, in cooperation with and under the supervision of her Juvenile Justice Counsellor, with any District Officer from the Department of Community Services who shall be assigned to assist the young person in the proper parental care of her son. 
      
      
     8 The conditions of the recognisance are not to be altered, attenuated or suspended, except by the prior order of a Judge of this Court, or of a higher Court.

     REGINA v ANTHONY MAKLOUF 
    The appellant was convicted of assaulting a taxi driver with intent to rob him: s 97(1) Crimes Act 1900. He was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for one year and three months, and to an additional term of penal servitude for one year and nine months. He appealed the conviction on four grounds: the trial judge’s discretion to admit photographs of him showing the cafe for the Downing Centre Court complex in the background, was wrongly exercised; the trial judge erred in not giving a warning as to picture identification evidence; misstatement of evidence by his Honour in summing up; and unsafe and unsatisfactory verdict.HELD (dismissing the appeal):Admission of photographs of accused - ground of appeal not made out(1) The exercise of discretion did not miscarry. The photographs were not suggestive of a café associated with a court building. It is improbable that the jury would have noticed the café when reporting for jury service, or that they or the taxi driver when making the identification, would have reasoned that the accused had some earlier involvement with the criminal law.  (2) There was no appreciable risk of unfairness to the appellant by showing the taxi driver a set of photographs in which the appellant appeared twice. There were other individuals who appeared more than once in the bundle. Moreover there was a specific advantage in showing two photographs of the appellant as one was full face whereas the other was in profile.Lack of warning as to picture identification evidence pursuant to s 115(7)(3) As no such warning was sought at trial, and leave was required to argue this ground, leave was refused. The appellant had not been taken into custody, and there was nothing in the photographs to suggest that the people in them were known to police.  (4) Section 115 is specifically directed to problems associated with “mug shots”. Subsection (7) depends on request being made by the accused, since in the absence of such a request, the discretions in ss 137 and 165, to exclude the evidence or to give a warning, provide ample protection for an accused. (5) To have given a warning here that the jury should not assume from the photographs that the appellant was know to police, would almost certainly have worked to the prejudice of the appellant since it risked inviting the jury to suspect those very matters.Alleged misstatement of evidence in summing up(6) Leave refused to argue this ground, as no point was taken at trial. The evidence was as consistent with the way his Honour summed up as it was with the suggested interpretation. Moreover, it was fresh in the minds of the jury, having been given the day before the summing up.Error of law or miscarriage of justice attracting s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act(7) After an independent review of the evidence, the Court was not persuaded that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt. (8) As to the inquiry required by M and Jones, the present case was one where the identification evidence was positive and unshaken. Furthermore the jury were given strong and comprehensive warnings; and their advantage in seeing and hearing the witness should be given full respect. M (1994) 181 CLR 207, Jones (1997) 72 ALJR 78, considered; Chidiac (1991) 17 CLR 432, applied.

     Regina v Anthony MAKLOUF 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted, after a two day trial before Shillington DCJ and a jury, of assaulting a taxi driver, Rong Gen Tao, with intent to rob him (S 97(1) Crimes Act 1900). He was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for one year and three months and to an additional term of penal servitude for one year and nine months. He now appeals against that conviction. 
     
      
     Crown Case 
      
    2   It was the Crown case that at 2am. on 22 November 1996, Rong Gen Tao’s taxi was hailed by two men in George Street Sydney. One man, alleged to be the appellant, sat in the front seat. The second man sat in the back seat. Tao was told to drive to Castlereagh Street to pick up a third man. When he could not be found, Tao was instructed to drive to Leichhardt. When the taxi arrived at Petersham about fifteen minutes later, Tao was asked to turn left into Railway Street. He parked parallel to another car and turned on the interior light. 
    3   At this point the man sitting in the back seat put something against the right hand side of Tao’s head and instructed him to take the money out. Tao turned his head and looked at the man in the back seat. He saw that he was holding a black tube 25 cms long which he believed was a gun. The man in the front seat instructed Tao not to touch anything, to put the money on the arm rest and not to look. That Tao understood to be an instruction not to look at the man behind him. He placed a five dollar note and some coins on the arm rest and said that the money was in the boot. He suggested that if they did not believe him, one man should stay in the taxi and that the other should check the boot. He released the boot catch. 
    4   The man in the back seat alighted from the off-side door. Tao saw him in the mirror on that side. Tao then looked across at the man in the front seat as he was getting out of the taxi. His body was out ofthe car with the exception of his legs. He was looking towards the back of the taxi at the other man. Tao immediately accelerated away. The man did not touch or take the money that he had placed on the arm rest.  
    5   The matter was reported to police. The description that Tao gave of the man in the front seat was about eighteen years old, with dark brown hair held together at the back. He was clean shaven, his skin colour was “like yellow”. He had no idea as to his nationality, but said that he was wearing a grey chequered top. The man behind he thought was Lebanese. 
    6   On 11 January 1997, the appellant was spoken to in relation to the offence, at Bankstown detectives office. He denied any involvement. On 15 January 1997, he was invited to participate in an identification parade but declined to do so. Photographs were taken of the appellant and another suspect on 23 January 1997, in Liverpool Street, outside the Downing Centre court complex. 
    7   On19 February 1997, Tao attended Petersham police station where he was shown a bundle of twenty six photographs. Senior Constable Stewart instructed him to look through the photographs once without making any comment, and then to look through them a second time and indicate whether he had seen any of the persons before. 
    8   During the second run through Tao indicated photograph 14, a photograph depicting three men. One had his back turned to the camera. It seems that he first picked a person wearing a striped shirt, standing beside the appellant. This man, Farrer, he said was “the person sit behind me, so this person take the gun touch my head”. He then pointed out the appellant, who was wearing dark pants and a white shirt, and standing with his arms folded, and whose hair was obviously gathered in a pony tail. Tao said, “I pick this person from George Street, he talk to me. I saw his face several times .. the person just sit near my seat in the cab.” 
    9   Tao was then asked to look through the rest of the photographs. He stopped at photograph 6, which similarly depicted the appellant with his arms folded, his hair swept back and possibly although not obviously gathered in a pony tail. He appeared to be speaking to the man whose back was turned to the camera in photograph number 14. The man in the striped shirt was not visible in this photograph. Tao said, “there’s another photograph, number 14 photograph, just like this man.” 
    10   The audio recording that was made of the identification process shows that when Tao was asked why he knew the man with the white shirt and ponytail he said: “But I pick this person from George Street, he talk to me. I saw his face several time.” 
    11   The yellow green and blue neon sign in the background of the photographs, that was more visible in photograph 6, was that of the café in the Downing Centre where the appellant was placed on trial. In each photograph the sign was illuminated, and by reason of its location inside the building, the area appeared to be dark, an impression that would have been encouraged by the fact that the buildings in the background appeared to have their lights on. The neon sign in each photo was somewhat obscured by greenery from a tree. All that can be seen in photograph number 14 is “CAFE … WNIN”. In photograph 6 the only words Visible are “DOWNING”. In photograph 6 the appellant could be seen full face, while in photograph 14 he could be seen only in profile.  
    12   During his evidence Tao said that he had spoken to the man sitting beside him in the taxi, and that it was he who gave the instructions as to where they were to go. He had a further conversation with him during the trip. Tao said that he had selected the two photographs because “I remembered this person so I chose these two photographs”, and later, “because these things happen before so I can recognise the two men. So I select the two photos.” He said that he was “absolutely certain”, “one hundred per cent certain,” that the men in the photographs were the same men who had entered his taxi. 
    13   When asked, in cross examination, if he had been informed of the reason for going to the police station on 19 February 1997, he replied that he had been told that he would be shown some photographs. When asked if he had expected to see the two men who had robbed him, he said “yes”. In re-examination, he was asked if he had thought that the man would be in the photographs or might not be. He said that he did not know. In his cross examination, Tao also acknowledged that when he had picked up the men, he had no particular reason to take notice of them, and that when he had reason to do so he was very scared. 
    14   The appellant was arrested on 25/3/97 and interviewed by way of ERISP. He said that he could not recall his whereabouts, or who he was with, at 2am. on 22 November 1996. He said, however, that he had never caught a taxi from the city to Petersham.  
    15   The appellant who was twenty years old at the time of the trial, did not give evidence, nor was any evidence called on his behalf. Although it was unknown to the jury, it may be assumed that investigating police knew that he had prior convictions for malicious damage and steal motor vehicles, and was a suspect for an offence having a marked similarity to the present, involving a taxi driver at Kings cross. This offence, it would appear from the reasons for sentence, occurred one month before the present offence. The co-offender was Robert Farrer, the other young man appearing in photograph 14. The appellant was convicted of it and sentenced, before he appeared for trial before Shillington DCJ. This is not a matter than can be taken into account in relation to his guilt or for the purposes of this appeal, save so far as it is relevant to a submission advanced by the appellant which I will mention later. 
    16   In his summing up the trial Judge gave comprehensive directions concerning identification evidence. He pointed out that such evidence can be unreliable, and drew particular attention to the factors in this case that may impact upon the reliability of Tao’s evidence. So it was that his Honour drew attention to the fact that the appellant was a stranger to the taxi driver; that there had been no identification parade; that the driver’s opportunity to see the offender had to be considered in the light of the circumstance that he was driving a taxi and his principal concentration was likely to be on that task; that he was scared; that identification from photographs was a poor second to seeing someone in the flesh; that there was a risk of displacement in that, having first identified the man in the striped shirt as the man in the rear seat, he may have assumed that the other man, who was also seen in the photograph, was the man in the front seat. 
    17   The reasons why these matters may affect reliability were pointed out. Further, his Honour emphasised more than once that the prosecution case rested solely on the identification evidence, and that the jury could only convict the appellant if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his identification by Tao. 
     
      
     Ground One 
      
      
     Objection was taken to tender of the evidence of the photographic identification, upon the basis that the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant outweighed the probative value of that evidence (S 137 Evidence Act 1995). There were three grounds for the objection: 
      
      
     (a) that the appearance in the background of the photographs of the Downing Centre Café neon signs might have led jurors who had seen that sign, when reporting for jury service on the first day of the trial, to suppose that the appellant was there as a person charged or associated with a criminal trial; 
      
      
     (b) that the fact that there were two photographs of the accused in the bundle of 26 photographs, risked encouraging Tao’s identification or reinforcing it; 
      
      
     (c) that having looked at photograph 14, and identifying the suspect co-offender Farrer, there was a risk that by association the victim wrongly identified the appellant in that photograph, and then again in photograph 6.  
      
    18   For the reasons mentioned by the trial Judge, I am unpersuaded that the exercise of discretion miscarried. 
    19   As to the first point, I have already made mention of the circumstance that the photographs give every impression of having been taken in the dark, and are not suggestive of a café associated with a court building. Rather, they are suggestive of a city café. The Downing Centre building is not evident, and it is improbable in the extreme that the jurors would have noticed the cafe inside the centre, when reporting for jury service. Even if they entered the building on the second and final day of the trial via a doorway which took them past that café, which is doubtful, there is little reason to assume that they would have taken any greater notice of it. 
    20   As his Honour observed, Liverpool Street is located in a busy part of the city to which people come from time to time, and the café is similarly used by people who have no association with the Court. His Honour expressed surprise, which I similarly share, whether any juror would have made the association or drawn the inference suggested. There was, in my view, no appreciable risk of unfairness to the appellant in this respect. 
    21   Perhaps more relevantly, so far as the identification itself was concerned, there was no reason to suppose that the taxi driver recognised the Downing Centre from the photograph, or was influenced by that circumstance, in making his identification. 
    22   As to the second head of complaint, which was based upon the assumption that the presentation of the appellant twice in the bundle of photographs might have caused Tao to focus subconsciously upon him, there are several answers. First, most of the photographs are of groups of young men, and there are included within their midst several persons with pony tails. Secondly, there were two other occasions where persons apart from the appellant, were depicted twice (photographs 15 and 23, and photographs 5 and 26). Thirdly, there was a specific advantage in showing two photographs of the appellant in that one showed him full face, and the other showed him in profile. The appellant submitted that the procedure adopted was akin to placing a suspect at one position in a line up, and then asking him to double around to the end of the line up after the witness had passed by him. What occurred in the present case is in no way analogous, and again I am quite unpersuaded that there was any appreciable risk of unfairness to the appellant. 
    23   As to the third objection, the reasoning suggested by the appellant, which depends on the existence of subtle influence, is, at best, tenuous. The photographs of the appellant were clearly of the same man, and they were taken in the same place. The persons depicted were not apparently engaged other than in innocent conversation in the street. There was nothing about them to suggest that either of them were the persons involved in the offence, or that they were personally known to police. They were very much less prejudicial than the old fashioned mug shots, and there was, to my mind, no risk of suggestion or displacement involved. I am quite unable to see how in the circumstances outlined, there was an appreciable risk of Tao being influenced to assume that the appellant had been associated with the other man depicted in the offence. The situation might have been otherwise had the police informed Tao that the man in the striped shirt was known to be the offender, or had been identified by someone else as a suspect. This, however, was not the case. 
    24   The evidence was of considerable probative value. Despite the lapse of time the victim was very definite in his identification. Moreover, although scared, he maintained his wits in resisting the attempted robbery and in making an escape from the situation. He had ample time to observe the appellant during the taxi trip, while he engaged in conversation with him, and when he was leaving the cab. He had, by that stage, illuminated the interior light and he looked at the man in the front seat before he left the vehicle. 
    25   This ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
     Ground Two 
      
    26   It was submitted that his Honour erred in not giving a warning pursuant to S 115(7) of the Evidence Act. That Section provides: 
     
      
       
       “If picture identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is admitted into evidence, the judge must, on the request of the defendant: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) if the picture of the defendant was made after the defendant was taken into that custody - inform the jury that the picture was made after the defendant was taken into that custody, or 
       
      
      
       
       (b) otherwise - warn the jury that they must not assume that the defendant has a criminal record or has previously been charged with an offence.” 
       
      
    27   No such warning was sought at the trial, and leave is required under R4 Criminal Appeal Rules to argue this ground. I would refuse leave. The submission is misguided. Neither the appellant nor any of the other persons depicted had been taken into custody, either at the time that the photographs were taken or at the time that identification was made. Nor was there anything in the photographs to suggest that the persons depicted were known to police or involved in any form of criminality. The section is not at large. It is directed to the problems associated with the use of “mug shots” ie pictures which themselves give the impression that the persons depicted were persons known to police. The Section takes its place alongside Section 137, which permits exclusion of evidence where its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, and S165 which permits any relevant or appropriate warning to be given to the jury. The discretion there reserved provides ample protection for an accused, and explains why S 115(7) depends upon request being made by the accused. 
    28   No request was made here for a warning. Moreover, to have given a warning to the jury that they should not assume from the photographic identification that the appellant had a criminal record, or had previously been charged with an offence, would almost certainly have worked to the prejudice of the appellant since it risked inviting the jury to suspect those very matters. Otherwise, there would have been no apparent reason for it. 
     
      
     Ground 3 
      
    29   It was submitted that his Honour misstated the evidence when, in summarising the evidence of Tao, he observed:  
     
      
       
       “He said he looked at both of the people at that stage and more particularly, when this item was held against the side of his head, he said in that situation he looked not only at the person behind, but also at the person beside him.” 
       
      
    30   No point was taken at the trial. It was argued, however, that leave should be given because of the criticality of the identification evidence, and because of the risk that the jury might have been misled as to the effect of the evidence of Tao. I am unpersuaded that this ground has been made good. First, it is the case that the evidence of Tao may be assumed to have been fresh in the minds of the jury, since he was the principal witness and had given his evidence the day before his Honour delivered his summing up. 
    31   Secondly, he did say that he looked at the man sitting alongside him, on the front seat, after the demand for money was made. Although on a very strict literal interpretation, that passage might be taken to suggest that Tao looked at both men while the item, assumed to be a gun, was held against his head, it is equally capable of being understood to have had a temporal connection to the entire incident, which lasted for a relatively short time, from the time of demand to the time that both men left the vehicle. It was the fact that Tao said that he looked across and saw the man still seated on the front seat, at a time when the interior light of the taxi was illuminated. It was to this evidence I believe the jury would have understood the passage to relate. 
    32   Even if the alternative meaning was that adopted by them there was in my view no risk of a miscarriage of justice arising. Tao did give evidence of seeing the appellant during the trip, and after the demand was made. It was upon the basis of those observations that his identification was made. The proviso to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act would apply, in those circumstances. However, having regard to the absence of any point being taken at the trial, I would refuse leave to rely on this ground. 
     
      
     Ground 4 
      
    33   Finally, it was submitted that by reason of the combination of matters outlined above, and the absence of any evidence incriminatory of the appellant, other than the identification evidence, the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. In further support of this ground, it was put that the identification occurred three months after the offence, and that there was a risk that the police had selected and placed photographs of him before Tao, either randomly because he had a pony tail, or because he was suspected of having been involved in the earlier robbery of a taxi driver at Kings Cross. 
    34   I am not persuaded, after an independent review of the nature and quality of the evidence, that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt; nor am I persuaded for the reasons earlier outlined that any of the other matters identified involved an error of law, or led to a miscarriage of justice of the kind that that would attract the intervention of the Court under s 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act. 
    35   As to the inquiry required by M (1994) 181 CLR 207 and by Jones  1997 72 ALJR 78, the present case is one where the identification evidence was positive, and was unshaken. Tao had a good opportunity to observe the men, and his response to the situation in which he became involved at the end of the trip shows that he retained his senses. It was to the appellant that Tao spoke, not only in relation to the route he was to take, but also while they discussed, during the trip, the purchase of taxis. 
    36   The appellant called no evidence in his case and the jury were given strong and comprehensive warnings. I am unable to see, in those circumstances, that there is any occasion for reasonable doubt. The case is one in which, to my mind, the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing Tao, should be given full respect: Chidiac (1991) 17 CLR 432. This ground has not been made out. 
    37   Accordingly, I would propose that the appeal be dismissed, and the conviction and sentence be confirmed.

    Reasons for judgment38   HIDDEN J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL that the appeal should be dismissed, substantially for the reasons his Honour has given. However, I wish to add a few comments of my own. 
    39   The array of photographs consisted of candid shots of men, including the appellant, taken at various urban locations. The advantage of such a selection of photographs, compared to the “mugshots” of earlier days, is obvious. Equally, the difficulty in obtaining a suitable series of photographs of this kind must be acknowledged. 
    40   That said, I consider it undesirable that a photographic array should contain a photo of the suspect in company with an alleged co-offender in the crime under investigation. Nor should it contain more than one photo of the suspect, as this may tend inappropriately to focus attention upon that person. I can understand that a suspect’s appearance at a court in relation to another matter might be a convenient opportunity to obtain a photo of him or her but, for obvious reasons, every effort should be made to ensure that it does not appear to have been taken in court precincts. 
    41   I must say that I was initially concerned that some of the jurors might have recognised that the photos of the appellant, particularly number six, had been taken outside the very court in which he was being tried before them. However, the contrary view of the experienced trial judge, who would be familiar with the Downing Centre, commands respect. I am not persuaded that his Honour fell into error in admitting the evidence. Equally, I am not satisfied that there has been any other miscarriage of justice or that the jury’s verdict is unreasonable.

     REGINA v JGW 
    The appellant was found guilty on three counts of homosexual intercourse with a male person under ten, one count of an attempt at that offence, one count of homosexual intercourse with a male person between ten and eighteen, and one count of indecent assault of a person under sixteen. He appealed the convictions.HELD (allowing the appeal on one count; otherwise dismissing the appeal):Ground 1 - amendment of indictment(1) The trial judge did not err in allowing an amendment to counts 2 and 3 as to the times particularised and in directing verdicts of acquittal in relation to two counts for which an amendment was refused. With respect to the latter counts, there was objective evidence available to the defence to show that the offences could not have occurred within the period charged. The time of the offences was vital to the defence in respect of those two counts but it was not so in relation to the remaining counts.  Westerman (1991) 55 A Crim R 353; MacDonald (1995) 84 A Crim R 508; Pfizner (1976) 15 SASR 171; VHP (NSWCCA, 7 July 1997); S (1989) 168 CLR 267, considered. (2) The inability of a complainant to be precise about dates does not necessarily lead to an unfair trial, although it may call for suitable directions to be given. The present case is typical of many cases involving allegations of sexual assault, where the details of the assault are clear in memory but the precise timing is not. The court was unable to conclude that vagueness as to precise dates resulted in unfairness to the appellant in allowing counts 2 and 3 to remain. Kennedy (NSWCCA, 9 December 1998), considered.Ground 2 - allowance of ERISP into evidence(3) The Crown was not bound to accept the offer of bare admissions in lieu of the tender of the ERISP, where the latter contains relevant evidence, as was the case here. The fact that formal admissions were offered or made does not, of itself, preclude the Crown from adducing further evidence on the issues the subject of the admissions.  Smith (1981) 1 NSWLR 193; Popovic (NSWCCA, 25 March 1996), considered. (4) There was no risk of prejudice or unfairness associated with tender of the ERISP in video form. The appellant appeared polite and cooperative; his denial of the actual offences alleged was explicit; and, contrary to his counsel’s submission, he did not appear inarticulate or unable to respond to questions. Plevac (1995) 84 A Crim R 570; BFM (NSWCCA, 6 February 1996); Graham [1998] HC 56, considered.(5) Nor was it sensible to edit out the questions and answers that amounted to denials of the specific incidents alleged. To have done so would have produced a distorted interview, and operated unfairly to the accused.Grounds 3 & 3A - directions on complaint evidence(6) Admissibility: it was clearly permissible for the Crown to seek and be given leave to prove the precise circumstances in which the complaint emerged, in the light of the cross-examination of the complainant which suggested that he had invented the complaint with the encouragement of his mother.  Graham (1998) 72 ALJR 1491; Papakosmos (NSWCCA, 10 December 1997), considered. (7) So far as the direction, given in relation to the evidence of the complainant’s mother, under s 165 might be understood as suggesting that the evidence was available as hearsay proof of the fact asserted, it accorded with the law as stated in BD, at the time of trial, and as now awaits review by the Hight Court in Papakosmos. Until or unless this Court is held to have been in error in this approach, it is inappropriate to intervene in this situation. BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131, considered. (8) Direction on delay in complaint: when read in light of the summing up as a whole, the balance was restored in accordance with Crofts, with the consequence that the jury were sufficiently instructed as to the manner in which delay may impact on the complainant’s credibility. Crofts (1996) 186 CLR 427; DJK (NSWCCA, 8 October 1998); Davies (1985) 3 NSWLR 276; Lemura (NSWCCA, 18 December 1998), considered. (9) While his Honour could usefully have referred, in a little more detail, to the effect of delay in complaint, in accordance with Longman, no specific difficulties were identified that may have affected the appellant’s ability to test the prosecution evidence. Nor did experienced trial Counsel make any request for a further warning. Longman (1989) 168 CLR 79; Johnston (NSWCCA, 31 July 1998); PAH (NSWCCA, 18 December 1998); Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12, considered. (10) His Honour’s warnings concerning inconsistency, and the standard direction given concerning the ability of the jury to accept part of the evidence and to reject part, were sufficient.(11) Although the absence of a request pursuant to s 165(2) does not excuse the trial judge from bringing any matter which may affect reliability of evidence to the attention of the jury, proper regard must be given to the judgment of trial Counsel in not seeking the warning. Moreover s 165 was not overlooked, as his Honour gave an express warning based on it (see (7)).Vawdrey (NSWCCA, 16 April 1998); BD (supra); Davis [1999] NSWCCA 15; Williams [1999] NSWCCA 9; PAH (supra); Murray (supra); Bromley (1986) 161 CLR 315, considered. Ground 4 - lies(12) His Honour gave the directions appropriate for a case, where the jury was invited to take a lie into account as indicating a consciousness of guilt, and as providing support for the complainant’s evidence. Preval (1984) 3 NSWLR 647; Sutton (1986) 5 NSWLR 697; Edwards (1993) 178 CLR 193; Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234; ST (1997) 92 A Crim R 390; Green [1999] HCA 13, considered.Ground 5 - “unsafe and unsatisfactory” verdict(13) This ground needs to be considered in the light of recent High Court observations concerning the expression “unsafe and unsatisfactory” being potentially misleading. It is imprecise and has no specific legislative basis. Fleming (1998) 158 ALR 379, Johnston (supra); Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53, considered. (14) There is a need to identify the ground of appeal relied upon with an appropriate degree of particularity, as well as a need to specify the nature of the order sought should the appeal succeed. (15) The Court was not satisfied that the errors identified in the remaining grounds were established, so as to result in a miscarriage of justice. The tendency to identify as many grounds of appeal as possible, no matter how spurious, and then to suggest that cumulatively they establish a miscarriage of justice, is to be discouraged. Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396; Wilde (1988) 164 CLR 365, considered. (16) The Court was similarly unpersuaded that after an independent review of the evidence, the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. The advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the witnesses should in this case be respected. M (1994) 181 CLR 487; Jones (1997) 72 ALJR 78; Chidiac (1991) 171 CLR 432, considered. (17) In relation to count 4, the complainant could not remember the year in which the offence occurred other than it happened when he was “about ten”. The appellant was convicted on the basis that the offence occurred in the complainant’s ninth year. However, the evidence left open the possibility that it occurred after his tenth birthday. For this reason, a conviction for an offence requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was under ten, was unsafe and unsatisfactory. (18) Where the jury is satisfied that the conduct charged did occur, but are uncertain whether the complainant was aged under or over ten years, they do not necessarily have to return a verdict of acquittal of any offence. The appellant could have been properly convicted of the alternative and lesser offence available under s 78K.  (19) The sentence for that offence is to be adjusted accordingly. Although the principle of totality requires that there be taken into account that for one offence, there lacked the factor of aggravation, nevertheless the difference in objective criminality was not sufficient to require any reduction in the overall sentencing order.

     Regina v JGW 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant was arraigned before his Honour Judge Coleman QC in the District Court at Liverpool on 13 October 1997, on an indictment containing eight counts, of which four (Counts 1, 2, 3 and 5) alleged homosexual intercourse with a male person under the age of ten years (S 78H Crimes Act 1900); one (count 6) alleged an attempt at that offence ( S 78I Crimes Act); one (count 7) alleged homosexual intercourse with a male person aged between ten years and under eighteen years (S 78K Crimes Act); one (count 4) alleged indecent assault of a person under the age of sixteen years and under the authority of the appellant (S 61M(2) Crimes Act); and one (count 8) alleged an indecent assault of a person under the age of sixteen years (S 61M(1) Crimes Act). 
    2   During the trial his Honour directed that the jury return verdicts of not guilty in respect of counts 4 and 5 of the indictment since it had become apparent that the events charged could not have occurred within the time frame alleged. Leave was granted to the Crown to amend the dates in counts 2, 3 and 8 of the original indictment, and as a consequence an amended indictment was presented containing the remaining six counts. 
    3   On 22 October 1997, the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of each count in the amended indictment. The sentence imposed in respect of the third count was one comprising a minimum term of five years and three months penal servitude, to commence from the date of conviction, and an additional term of one year and nine months. In relation to all other counts, save the one count of indecent assault that was left, the appellant was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of two years penal servitude. For the count of indecent assault the sentence was one of a fixed term for twelve months. The appellant now appeals against the convictions, but does not seek leave to appeal against the sentences, save in respect of one contingency that emerged during the closing stage of the submissions, to which I will return.  
     
      
     The Crown Case 
      
    4   The complainant NW was born on 31 October 1980, and was the natural son of the appellant. It was the Crown case that from about the age of seven years to fifteen years, he was subjected to sexual assault by his father. 
     
      
     Count 1 (homosexual intercourse under ten years) 
      
    5   It was the Crown case that this offence occurred when NW was aged about seven years, and living with his family at St Marys. One night he slept on a brown fold out sofa in the lounge in the family room, it having been planned that he would leave early the next morning with his father, who was working on a garbage run. He said that during the night the appellant woke him and asked him to scratch his stomach, and then placed his hand on his penis. The appellant, NW said, then placed him on his back and sucked his penis. This activity was interrupted by the arrival home of the mother of NW, who had been working night shift. The appellant told him to pretend to be asleep. 
     
      
     Count 2 (homosexual intercourse under ten years) 
      
    6   The next incident which NW said that he was able to remember occurred when he was about seven or eight years old, again at the family home in St Marys. NW said that the appellant joined him while he was in the shower, and instructed him to suck his penis. In the course of doing so, he noticed that the appellant’s penis, which was erect, had a tattoo on it which read “the baby maker”. He said that the word “the” was positioned above the other words, but was uncertain whether those words were side by side. He could not recall whether the words were in upper or lower case. He said that the skin on his father’s penis had to be stretched out to read the tattoo. At one stage the appellant left the bathroom and returned with a red plastic chair, upon which he sat. He indicated that he wanted NW to sit on him in this position. NW could not recall what had happened after that. He had an imperfect recollection of the incident, although he did remember the appellant playing with his, ie NW’s, penis in the bathroom at some stage. 
     
      
     Count 3 (homosexual intercourse under ten years) 
      
    7   NW said that when he was about nine years old, he and the appellant spent a night in a tent which the appellant had erected in the back yard. On his account, during a “muck around fight” the appellant grabbed his penis and then placed his, NW’s, hand on his own penis. The appellant sucked the penis of NW, and then sat on it, inserting in into his own anus. The appellant masturbated himself to ejaculation. 
     
      
     Count 4 (originally count 6) attempted homosexual intercourse under ten years 
      
    8   NW said that when he was about ten years old he was sleeping on the floor in the lounge room. He awoke to find that his pants had been pulled down, that there was oil in the region of his anus and that the appellant was attempting to enter him. He felt pain but did not know whether he had been penetrated or not. 
     
      
     Count 5 (originally count 7) homosexual intercourse with a person aged ten to eighteen years 
      
    9   NW said that when he was aged about thirteen years the family went on a holiday to the Dunleigh Caravan Park at The Entrance. While he was in the shower block at about 6pm, the appellant entered an adjoining cubicle. As he was about to leave the appellant called him into his cubicle, where he began to play with his penis, and then sucked it. NW’s penis became erect, whereupon the appellant bent over and drew him closer so as to introduce NW’s penis into his own anus. 
     
      
     Count 6 (formerly count 8) indecent assault under sixteen years 
      
    10   The last incident which NW recalled occurred, on his account, at Mary Beach during the 1995 Christmas holidays. NW, his younger brother, and a son of the appellant from a prior marriage, went camping with him. NW went to the tent to change after he had been swimming. The appellant touched him on the penis from outside his shorts. He said “no, don’t”, at which point the appellant desisted. 
     
      
     Verdicts by Direction 
      
    11   The counts in respect of which there were verdicts by direction comprised allegations that the appellant touched NW on the penis between 1October 1988 and 31 January 1989, in the swimming pool at their St Marys home (original count 4); and that the appellant sucked the penis of NW and made NW suck his penis in the granny flat at those premises, between 1 October 1988 and 15 February 1989 (original count 5). Directed verdicts were returned in relation to these counts after it was established that the swimming pool, in which it was alleged that the conduct charged in the original count 4, occurred, had been constructed, at earliest, one year nine months after the last of the dates particularised. A similar problem arose in relation to count 5 since the conduct charged in that count was alleged to have occurred on the same day as that for count 4, ie after the appellant and the complainant had walked from the pool to the granny flat, yet the period particularised similarly preceded the earliest date on which that could have occurred by about one year nine months. 
     
      
     Uncharged incident 
      
    12   NW also gave evidence of an incident, not the subject of any charge, which he said occurred in the family home when he was about nine or ten years of age. He was sitting on a lounge watching television when the appellant asked if he wanted to see a movie. The appellant then inserted a cassette into the video recorder. It began as a video of him playing soccer but then moved on to a pornographic video. The appellant watched it for a while and then began to rub NW’s penis. The appellant turned off the video when NW’s mother entered the room. 
     
      
     Other evidence in the prosecution case 
      
    13   NW’s mother, SW, gave evidence. She said that on more than one occasion she had seen the appellant sleeping with NW on the brown couch in the family room. She also said that there had never been an occasion when the subject of the tattoo on the appellant’s penis was discussed with the children. She said that the tattoo could not be read unless the appellant’s penis was erect, and then only when the viewer was very close and at groin level. When flaccid the writing was obscured by skin folds, and could not be seen unless the skin was pulled down. She confirmed, as NW had suggested, that the word “the” was a little bit above the other words. 
    14   She recalled an occasion when she was lying in bed reading a book, and became aware of the appellant going to the bathroom on three occasions within a short time, and of the light being switched off in the family room. When she ran into that room she saw the appellant, who was very close to NW, moving away from him. The television was off. She asked the appellant what was going on. He called her “a fucking goose” and said that “all men muck around with their kids”. 
    15   During his cross examination, NW agreed that, on 26 August 1996 when he was fifteen years old, his mother had asked him whether he had been sexually molested by his father. He replied in the affirmative. In the course of this cross examination, it was put to NW, that he had concocted the allegations in order to assist his mother because he knew that she wanted the appellant to leave the St Marys premises. 
    16   In her evidence (which was given after NW had been cross examined on this topic) SW said that, on that date, NW had said something to her to suggest that the appellant had been abusing him for eight years. She asked him some questions about what had happened. He replied that “his father made him suck his dick and he had to do the same and that he’d put it in his bum”. A few weeks later, she said, she had found a pornographic magazine and a video cassette labelled “Nathan’s Soccer”, in a cooler bag located in an entertainment unit in the dining room. SW and a friend watched this video and saw that it included a pornographic movie.  
    17   After the appellant was arrested, he participated in an electronically recorded interview, an edited version of which was received into evidence, over the objection of the defence. In the course of the interview, the appellant denied the allegations of sexual assault which were put to him. He admitted to having a tattoo “the baby maker”, on his penis, in letters about 2and a half inches long. He said, “You can’t miss it, its just written in big letters, in big print”. He thought that the letters could be read when his penis was flaccid, and that they got bigger when it was erect. He said that he had spoken to NW about the tattoo.  
    18   He also admitted going to the caravan park at The Entrance at the end of 1993, and to Mary Beach over the 1996/1997 Christmas school holidays, but denied having any pornographic videos at his home, or having shown any such video to NW. He thought he had brought one such video home from the garbage once, but as it was not a good copy he had thrown it out. 
     
      
     The appellant’s case 
      
    19   The appellant gave evidence and was cross examined. He denied the allegations of sexual misconduct, and said that he had spoken to NW about the tattoo on a couple of occasions, once when he was about nine or ten years old, and once when he was about thirteen or fourteen years old. It had also been discussed generally within the family from time to time. During his cross examination, he said that the words on his penis could not be read, even when it was erect. The tattoo had been done by him while he was in prison, using a device which he had rigged up involving an alarm clock. The tattoo had become infected, and the ink had spread. The words he said were in three lines, one above the other on an angle, but they could not be read because they became dotted. One half of the letters he said “went” once the infection set in.  
    20   His evidence concerning this topic and the video recorder bordered on the flippant. Even allowing for some degree of naivety and natural embarrassment, he must have left a very poor impression with the jury as to his credibility - a matter which I consider of some significance in relation to ground 5. The following extracts from his cross examination illustrate this: 
     
      
       
       “Q. Why did you have it done? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Because - why did I have it done? Because I was bored one night when I was in gaol and I had an alarm clock and I used that for a tattoo gun and put it on my penis, something to do. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. So you did it yourself? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yeah, it was a home job.” 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       “Q. Did you tell the police that you weren’t able to read those words? 
       
      
      
       
       A. No, I said you could read it because I haven’t paid much attention to it really. There was no way at the police station I could have a look at me dick to see whether you could read it or not, I just didn’t pay any attention to it. I just thought you could read it but you can’t because when I got home from the police station I put me glasses and I couldn’t even read it. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Mr. Wells do you say to this jury that before the police asked you that question or asked you a question in the ERISP “Can you read the words when your penis is not erect?’ 
       
      
      
       
       A. yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. That you hadn’t looked at your penis for some time, is what you’re saying? 
       
      
      
       
       A. I’ve never taken any notice of it. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Is that a serious answer sir? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yeah I’ve never take much notice of the tattoo, I’ve had it all me life I’ve got no - it doesn’t bother me I never look at it.” 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       “Well didn’t you think that was an important matter that you were being asked about when the police asked you questions about that tattoo? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Not really. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Not really, is that your answer? 
       
      
      
       
        A. Yeah I just don’t think it was that important. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did you think to say to the police, could you have a look at your penis before you answered the question if you were unsure about it? 
       
      
      
       
       A. l I suppose I could have done, I never thought - never come across me mind, what am I going to pull it out in front of the police woman or something. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. See Mr Wells I suggest to you that these answers you’re giving are just nonsense? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Are they, I don’t think so. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       But you’d told the police in more than one question that you were able to read this tattoo on your penis? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Well I thought you could but you can’t you know, you just can’t read it, I don’t know, you know. You can’t read it at all. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. When you answered these questions that were put to you by the police you thought you could read it. Is that what you’re saying. 
       
      
      
       
       A. I thought you might have been, yeah. Just an honest mistake. If you don’t believe me, I’ll flop it out now and you can have a look. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       Can I then ask you on that piece of paper that I gave you with the pen, to indicate on that piece of paper the shaft and what was tattooed on your penis? 
       
      
      
       
       A. While its hard or soft, huh? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Could you do it when the penis is erect? 
       
      
      
       
       A. I need a bigger piece of paper. Bloody hell. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Mr. Wells, why did you say that? 
       
      
      
       
       A. (not transcribable) 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Mr. Wells? 
       
      
      
       
       A. What? 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Why did you say -- 
       
      
      
       
       A. Wishful thinking. Do you want it like so you can’t read it or do you just want it in writing that you can read? 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Didn’t you say that you had a lock on the video? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yeah, there was a lock on the video so the kids couldn’t use the video. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Why did you want to stop the kids using the video? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Because they might bloody put a piece of toast in there or something, heavens knows. Jut never, because we had other movies at home that kids shouldn’t see. They weren’t pornographic ones but they were R-rated ones. I used to bring them home from the Colyton and watch them sometimes.” 
       
      
      
    21   He said that he had never slept on the lounge with NW before going to work. He had brought a video cassette home from the tip once because cassettes were dear. He knew there was a pornographic movie on the tape, and that it had been there when he brought it home. Some friends had taped the soccer over it. He denied having watched it with NW, but had done so with his wife. In relation to the incident when she had run into the lounge room, he said that he and NW had been about to watch a Jackie Chan movie on SBS. 
    22   He admitted that he had been to the Dunleigh Caravan Park with his family on two occasions. He said that the showers were always busy between about 5pm. and 8pm, and that during those hours there were always fathers queuing with their children, and that anything that happened could be heard. 
     
      
     Ground 1 
      
    23   It was submitted that his Honour erred in allowing an amendment of counts 2 and 3, so as to substitute the period “between 31 October 1987 and 30 October 1989” for the period originally charged, (ie “between 31 December 1987 and 31 March 1988”) in count 2; and “between 31 October 1989 and 30 October 1990” for the period originally charged, (ie “between 1 February 1988 and 31 May 1988”) in count 3. The amendment to the original count 8 (now count 6), it was acknowledged, was of no moment, the commencing date having been enlarged from 31 December 1995 as originally charged, to 1 December 1995. 
    24   In allowing the amendment, and in drawing a distinction between the original counts 4 and 5, which went, and the remaining counts which were preserved, either with or without amendment, his Honour had regard to Westerman (1991) 55 A Crim R 353, where Lee CJ at CL noted that the power to amend an indictment under S 365 of the Crimes Act is a very wide power, but one that: 
     
      
       
       “ought not to be exercised when it gives rise to a real prejudice to the accused”.  
       
      
    25   His Honour concluded that, having regard to the way that the case had been fought, to permit the amendment in relation to counts 4 and 5, where objective evidence was available as to the time that the pool had been constructed, would have unfairly watered down the defence case. As in Westerman, the clash had been one between the Crown and the defence as to whether the events had happened at all; after the amendment sought (to postdate the charge until after the pool had been built, and at a time after the complainant had attained the age of ten years) would have left the jury with the obligation of considering whether NW had been mistaken as to the time of the offences, but not in regard to the fact of them having been committed. 
    26   As was the case in MacDonald (1995) 84 A Crim R 508, the accused had come to trial to answer the charges as particularised, and the particulars concerning the time of those two alleged offences was vital to the defence as it was to be presented. In those circumstances, his Honour thought it unfair to exercise the discretion he possessed, (since the date of the offences was not an essential element of the charges), to allow the amendment. To do so would have required the appellant to meet a new case which had not been raised until the close of the evidence. 
    27   His Honour in fact followed MacDonald which had applied Pfizner (1976) 15 SASR 171, where Bray CJ had said (at 185): 
     
      
       
       “Whether the date alleged in an information is vital to the charge must depend on the circumstances. So long as it is clear that the controversy turns on the events of a certain occasion, it may not matter if the date of that occasion is misstated if the occasion itself is clearly identified and both parties have directed their cases towards it: cf  
       Page v Butcher 
        (1957) SASR 165. But obviously if a man is charged with committing an offence on Saturday and comes prepared with an alibi for Saturday, he cannot be convicted of committing the offence on Friday or Sunday, unless perhaps the information is amended and the trial adjourned to enable him to meet the new case. If authority is needed for so obvious a proposition, it will be found in  
       Wright v Nicholson 
        (1979) q WLR 142; (1970) All ER 12; (1970) Cr App R 38”. 
       
      
    28   His Honour was, in my view, correct in the way in which he approached counts 4 and 5, and in drawing a distinction between these counts and the remaining counts, where no similar defence or evidentiary issue arose, save for a general denial of the conduct alleged. Time is generally not of the essence for offences of this kind: VHP (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 7 July 1997) although it has a relevance in a different way to which I will return, in the case of count 4.  
    29   The defence did not pursue the line, in relation to any of the preserved counts, that they did not occur because it could be shown objectively or independently that the complainant’s evidence concerning some detail associated with them, such as the time of a holiday, or a visit to a certain location, could not have been true, or that the appellant had an alibi for the period charged. In summary, the kind of problem identified in Pfizner, MacDonald and Westerman, did not arise for these counts. 
    30   As an associated submission it was asserted that the evidence given, in relation to these counts, fell into the difficulty identified in S, (1989) 168 CLR 267. The problem there identified was however very different, the complainant being unable in that case to do more than say that there were  
     
      
       
       “further acts (of intercourse) but I cannot recall all the details of them or when they were. I have blanked them out”.  
       
      
    31   The point of that decision was that, in the absence of any act or acts being identified as the subject of an offence charged in an indictment, the Crown cannot lead evidence that is equally capable of referring to a number of occasions, any one of which might constitute an offence the legal nature of which is described in the charge, and invite the jury to convict on any one of them.  
    32   The present case is very different in that specific acts were identified in relation to each count, with accompanying detail that related them to a particular circumstance or place such as a holiday, a night in a tent, an incident in a shower, or a plan to join the appellant on his garbage run, as well as to the age of the complainant.  
    33   The inability of a complainant to be precise as to dates, leaving an accused with little more than a blanket denial, does not necessarily mean that the trial is unfair, although it may call for suitable directions to be given to the jury of the kind discussed later in these reasons: Kennedy (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 9 December 1998). It may also require a critical review of the complainant’s evidence where the “unsafe and unsatisfactory” ground of appeal is raised.  
    34   The present case is in fact little different from very many, if not the majority of cases involving allegations of sexual assault where, although the details of the assault are clear and explicit in memory, the precise timing of them is not. I am unable to conclude that any vagueness concerning the precise dates of incidents alleged, resulted in an unfairness for the appellant in allowing counts 2 and 3 to remain, or otherwise. In this regard it is not irrelevant that, whether amended or unamended, the only defence that the appellant raised in relation to these counts was one of a blanket denial. 
    35   I am accordingly of the view that his Honour’s discretion to allow the amendment to counts 2 and 3, and to count 6 (formerly count 8), in the fresh indictment, did not miscarry. This ground has not been made good on this point, or on the more general S point. 
     
      
     Ground 2 
      
    36   It was submitted that his Honour erred in allowing the ERISP into evidence over the appellant’s objection. It was the case that in lieu of the tender, Counsel for the appellant offered to make admissions as to the matters which the Crown wished to establish from it. That having been offered, the submission went, the ERISP had no evidentiary relevance, and its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant since it depicted an accused, a relatively inarticulate man, being questioned by two police officers in a small room. Upon that basis, the argument proceeded, it should have been excluded, either under S 102 of the Evidence Act, since it only went to the credibility of the appellant, or under S 137 of the Act. For completeness, although reference was not made to these provisions, I would add that, if regard was properly to be had to a discretionary exclusion of the evidence, then S 90, as well as SS 135 and 136, would also arise for consideration. Again, although not adverted to in argument, if the evidence was not “relevant”, as defined in S 55 of the Evidence Act, then its admission would be precluded by S 56 of the Act. I propose accordingly to consider this ground in the light of all of these provisions.  
    37   In Plevac (1995) 84 A Crim R 570, the Court (Badgery-Parker, Dunford and Simpson JJ) set out (at 579-580) eleven propositions relevant to the admissibility of questions put to an accused, and of the answers given, in the course of a formal interview. Although this judgment was delivered before the Evidence Act, and is now subject to some additional considerations (eg those contained in part 3.4,) the propositions enunciated remain of general application. Those of immediate relevance are the following: 
     
      
       
       “4. The answers given by the suspect are admissible in evidence (and hence, so are the questions) if they are relevant; but not otherwise:  
       Grills 
        at 413, 419;  
       Taylor 
        at 9. 
       
      
      
       
       5. An answer (and the question to which it is given) is relevant if it is an admission, or is capable of being regarded as an admission, of guilt or of a fact relevant to the proof of guilt:  
       Astill 
        (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales, 17 July 1992) at pp 8 -13. 
       
      
      
       
       6. If an answer is not unequivocally an admission but is capable of being regarded as such, it is a question for the jury whether it is such. Subject to the exercise of the judge’s discretion, the question and answer are admissible but it is necessary that the jury be clearly and fully directed that it is a question for them as to whether the answer does or does not amount to a relevant admission:  
       Astill 
        at pp.11-15. 
       
      
      
       
       7. An answer which is not capable of being regarded as an admission is on the face of it irrelevant and therefore inadmissible  
       Grills 
        at 413;  
       Taylor 
        at p9. 
       
      
      
       
       8. However, answers of that sort may yet be admissible if they form part of an interrogation in the course of which some answers do amount to admissions or are capable of being so regarded, where the question and answers which do not themselves contain admissions are relevant to set the other questions and answers in context, and/or to show that there was no impropriety on the part of the police in the conduct of their interrogation:  
       Taylor 
        at pp9-10;  
       Barca 
        (1975) 133 CLR 82 at 107’

        at 418-419;  
       Towers  
       (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 7 June 1993) at pp 10-11. 
       
      
      
       
       9. In such circumstances, the trial judge must always carefully consider whether questions and answers which are not capable of amounting to relevant admissions, should be excluded because they are prejudicial”  
       Grills 
        at 419-420;  
       Ireland 
        at 332;

       ;  
       Astill 
       .” 
       
      
    38   Reference was also made to BFM (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 6 February 1996) where the Court said: 
     
      
       
       “His Honour seems to have been of the view that the response and the manner of the response of an accused person when confronted with the allegations against him is always relevant…..Such evidence is commonly led by the Crown and commonly not objected to by the accused, particularly where there has been a straight forward denial of the allegations from the start. However, where objection is taken, such evidence should not be admitted unless it is shown to be relevant and otherwise satisfies the law of evidence including the discretionary power of the trial judge to exclude unfairly prejudicial evidence.” 
       
      
      
     and to  
     Graham 
      (1998) HC 56, where Callinan J said: 
      
      
       
       “The denials of the appellant were not capable of being regarded by the jury as admissions. They were otherwise irrelevant. The record of interview, once it was admitted, became the source of material for a cross examination of the appellant on peripheral or irrelevant issues and caused the introduction into evidence of matters which had a real potential for prejudice to him. 
       
      
      
       
       The challenge to the admissibility of the record of interview was correctly made. It should certainly not have been admitted in its entirety, if at all. Even if it had been otherwise admissible this would have been an appropriate case for its discretionary exclusion pursuant to s137 of the Evidence Act.”…. 
       
      
    39   The ERISP has been viewed by this Court in order to determine whether the demeanour, or manner in which the appellant answered the questions asked of him, risked presenting him in an unfavourable light. I am unequivocally of the view that it did not. The interview was conducted quietly and professionally. There were no signs of irritation or hesitation by the appellant. There was no conduct on his part that could be viewed other than as polite and co-operative. Nor did he present as inarticulate or as unable to respond to the questions as he chose. Moreover, his denial of the actual offences alleged was explicit, unhesitating and unqualified. It follows that there was no risk of prejudice or unfairness associated with the tender of the ERISP in video form. A discretionary exclusion was not warranted on this account. 
    40   The submission as to relevance falls into the difficulty that a number of answers given were relevant, and of advantage to the Crown in presenting its case. They include the following: 
     
      
     50: (residence at St Marys with NW, at the time of the relevant counts) 
      
      
     62 - 68; 149-161; 166/167; and 171-175: (the appearance and legibility of the tattoo on his penis when erect and when flaccid) 
      
      
     98 - 103: (whether he had a pornographic movie of the kind mentioned by NW and his mother) 
      
      
     113 - 123; 202-204: (whether the family holidayed at Dunleigh Caravan Park at the end of 1993, and whether it had a shower block with cubicles of the kind NW described) 
      
      
     130 -136; 217-219: (whether the family went camping at Marys Beach in the 1996/1997 Christmas holidays); 
      
      
     185-199: (his ownership of a tent while at St Marys at the relevant time and its erection from time to time in the garden). 
      
    41   Each of these matters was capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of the existence of the facts asserted by NW, in relation to the offences charged. As such the answers were relevant and admissible under the Evidence Act. 
    42   The Crown was entitled to prove its case as it wished. It was not bound to accept the offer of bare admissions from the appellant in lieu of the tender of the record of interview, nor would it have been sensible to edit out the questions and answers that amounted to denials of the specific incidents of misconduct alleged. The questions and answers identified above drew their significance from the content in which they were put, and to have edited the ERISP further would have produced a very distorted interview. Moreover, upon my assessment, it would have been more likely to have led to a charge of unfairness, since the appellant would have been entitled to have the balance restored by the denials. The present case is very different from those cited in argument where material that was truly irrelevant, or became the source for cross examination on peripheral matters, or was otherwise prejudicial, was admitted.  
    43   Moreover, the Crown was unable to determine in advance what case the defence would call, or whether succinct admissions without relevant detail, would have been sufficient for its purposes. In fact, as events transpired, it can be seen that a bare admission, for example, that the appellant had a tattoo “the baby maker” on his penis, would have fallen short of the proof that the Crown required. Whether it would or would not have been allowed to call a case in reply, or to reopen its case, is problematic. 
    44   I do not consider that, as a matter of principle, the Crown should be required to accept admissions in lieu of a record of interview, where the latter can be seen to contain evidence that qualifies as relevant, and where there is no occasion, otherwise, for a discretionary exclusion under SS 90, or 135 to 137 of the Act. It is well settled that the fact that formal admissions have been made does not, of itself, preclude the Crown from adducing further evidence on the issues which are the subject of the admissions: Smith (1981) 1 NSWLR 193. There is no reason for assuming that enactment of the Evidence Act has altered that principle: Popovic (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 25 March 1996 (per McInerney and Abadee JJ; Hulme J not deciding). This ground has accordingly not been made good. 
     
      
     Grounds 3 and 3A 
      
    45   These grounds related to the directions given concerning the evidence of complaint. In substance it was submitted: 
     
      
     (a) that the complaint evidence should not have been admitted; 
      
      
     (b) that the complaint evidence having been admitted, his Honour failed adequately to direct the jury in accordance with  
     Crofts 
      (1996) 186 CLR 427; 
      
      
     (c) that, his Honour failed to give a sufficient warning to the jury concerning the delay in complaint, as required by  
     Longman 
      (1989) 168 CLR 79, and  
     Johnston 
      (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 31 July 1998 unreported); and 
      
      
     (d) that his Honour failed to give a sufficient warning to the jury concerning the reliability of the complainant’s evidence, arising from his vagueness as to the dates of the alleged offences, and from the fact that two counts had been withdrawn. 
      
    46   I will deal with each of these points in turn: 
     
      
     (a)  
     Admissibility of the complaint evidence 
     . 
      
      
     The trial took place before  
     Graham 
      (1998) 72 ALJR 1491, where it was held that unless the complaint was recent or immediate, and possibly made within days of the offence, it was not “fresh” within the meaning of S 66 of the Evidence Act, and hence not admissible. It was also held that unless the making of the complaint could be said to assist the resolution of the question whether the complainant had fabricated his or her evidence of the offence, the fact of complaint was not relevant, and evidence of it should be excluded. The question whether evidence of complaint stands as evidence of the fact was not decided, and remains reserved for decision in  
     Papakosmos 
      (special leave having been granted from the decision of this Court, Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 10 December 1997, unreported). 
      
    47   In the present case, the Crown did not seek to tender proof of the complaint during the evidence in chief of NW. Counsel for the appellant introduced the issue during his cross examination of NW, in the course of which he invited his agreement to the proposition that he had fabricated the evidence of the offence in order to assist his mother, because she wanted the appellant out of the home.  
    48   It was put to NW unequivocally and repeatedly that he had first complained in response to a leading question from his mother: 
     
      
       
       “Do you remember that in August of 1996 your mother coming to you and saying these words to you “Have you been sexually molested?” ? A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. At about 3pm. on Monday 26 August did your mother say to you ‘Have you been sexually molested by your father?’? A. Yep that’s when I told her. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You didn’t say anything to her until she asked you that question did you? A. I was just crying and I was upset and I just couldn’t hold it in and it all just built up in here. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. On that date 26 August 1996 your mother and the accused were separated? A. yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And they were arguing a lot, weren’t they? A. yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You knew that your mother wanted to move the accused out didn’t you? A. Don’t know - no not really. I knew that they were fighting and that.” 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Didn’t you just give evidence that you knew that she wanted him out of there? A. she wanted him out of there because he left. She must have if he moved in the granny flat. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Then your mother wanted him out of the granny flat, didn’t she? A. yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And she came to you on 26 August 1996, and said “have you been sexually molested by your father?, do you agree with that? A. Yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And you said “Yes”? That was a false allegation wasn’t it? A. It wasn’t.” 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       Q. When you mother asked you whether you had been sexually molested by your father did you think you were helping her by saying yes? A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did you think you were helping her to get rid of the accused out of the granny flat and out of your lives? A. No, I didn’t think that at all. I was crying and …” 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       “Q. You told your mother - you answered your mother’s question “have you been sexually molested by your father?” “Yes” not because that was true but because you thought that would help her and you? A. It’s true. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And your difficulty in recollection arises out of the fact that these allegations are not true? A. Yes they are. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. They’re made up by you and you have difficulty remembering your statement? A. No, not at all. 
       
      
      
       
       “Q. You knew on 26 August 12996 your mother put a proposition to you , have you been sexually molested by your father, she said that didn’t she? A. yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And she said that without you first saying anything to her? A. I don’t understand that question. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. I’ll withdraw it. That was what led to you making a complaint to her? A. I don’t understand. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. In response to that question you said ‘yes’? A. Not straight away, I didn’t want to tell her. She started crying and I couldn’t hold it in. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. At the time that you said ‘yes’ to that proposition you were angry and the accused because he’d moved out of the family home and moved into the room that had been set up for you? A. Yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And he moved out of the family home in November 1995 didn’t he? A. I’m not sure of the date but he did move out because he had to. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Your mother didn’t want him around any more did she? A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       “You said “yes” to that proposition put by your mother because you thought she wanted you to say “yes”? A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. you made a false allegation because you thought it would help-- A. No I didn’t. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. -- Both you and your mother? A. No.” 
       
      
      
     The Crown Prosecutor thereafter sought and obtained leave under S 108 of the Evidence Act, without objection, to lead evidence from NW’s mother of the complaint. 
      
    49   Clearly, it became permissible in the light of the cross examination of NW, for the Crown to prove the precise circumstances in which, and the time at which, the complaint emerged. That went to the very heart of the issue that had been raised by the defence, namely whether, with the encouragement of his mother, NW had invented a complaint to her of sexual abuse by his father, which then matured into the account that he gave to the police, and later to the jury.  
    50   In these circumstances the complainant’s mother was in my view properly permitted to give evidence on this topic, as follows: 
     
      
       
       “CROWN PROSECUTOR Q: On that day did Nathan say something to you at home? A. Are we referring to 26 August? 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Yes? A. Yes he did. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. What did he say to you? A. He said to me - there were other things that he said, but what he actually said to me that his father had been abusing him for eight -- 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Now - I’m sorry, for? A. Eight years. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did you ask him some questions about what had happened? A. yes.” 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. On that day did Nathan say something to you at home? A. Are we referring to 26 August? 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Yes. A. Yes he did. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. What did he say to you? A. He said to me - there were other things that he said, but what he actually said to me that his father had been abusing him for eight -- 
       
      
      
       
        Q. Now - I’m sorry, for? A. Eight years. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did you ask him some questions about what had happened? A. Yes., 
       
      
      
       
       Q. What did he say? A. He told me that his father had made him - will I say it? I don’t know -- 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Well if you could-- 
       
      
      
       
       HIS HONOUR: Q. You may use the words that he told you, don’t be embarrassed about it, just as best you can recall it tell us what was said. Please go on? A. He told me that his father made him suck his dick and he had to do the same and that he’d put it in his bum.” 
       
      
      
     This was followed by cross examination: 
      
      
       
       “BABB: Q: In relation to 26 August 1996, I put to you that the details given to you by NW weren’t given spontaneously, they were given as a result of a question from you and that question was, “have you been sexually molested by your father”? A. I believe I said to him, “NW, do you want to talk to me” first, that’s what I believe and then I said “Has anything happened to you?. I may have used those words, I’m not sure, it was very traumatic. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       Q. I put to you that the conversation started as a result of you saying “Have you been sexually molested by your father?” A. He told me, he told me, I said, “Do you want to talk to me son” 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You didn’t say those words I put to you before he came out with these allegations? A. He said “Would I believe the big person or the little person” and I said “NW, big people, or I guess parents are supposed to love and protect their children”, that’s what I said and possibly I may not have the right words for you, but he told me that it was his father - it’s in my statement and I don’t believe I can say any more.” 
       
      
    51   Prior to the summing up, Counsel for the appellant asked his Honour to limit the use of this evidence under S136 Evidence Act, although without stating in clear terms how it was to be restricted. It is evident from the argument, and the way in which the matter was left, that all his Honour was prepared to do was to give a caution under S165 of the Evidence Act concerning its reliability as hearsay evidence. 
    52   So it was that his Honour said of this evidence, when summing up: 
     
      
       
       “I must caution you, ladies and gentlemen, that the evidence that you heard concerning complaint from his mother was hearsay evidence and that it may be unreliable. That is, it is not evidence of what she heard or saw directly herself but of evidence of what she remembers her son having told you, and you should take that into account when you come to assess that evidence. The evidence can be used, ladies and gentlemen, when you come to consider the truth of the subject matter of the complaints, that is, the truth of the allegations that on one occasion his father attempted to put his penis into his anus and on another occasion had touched him on the outside of his shorts.” 
       
      
    53   So far as this direction might have been understood as suggesting that the evidence was available as hearsay proof of the facts asserted, it accorded with the law as stated by this Court in BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131, at the time of the trial, and as now awaits review by the High Court in Papakosmos. Until or unless this Court is held to have been in error in the approach which it has adopted, I am not persuaded that it would be appropriate to intervene in this appeal, either upon the basis that the evidence ought not to have been admitted, or upon the basis that his Honour was in error in the direction that was given, as to the use to which it could be put. The direction as to its hearsay nature, however, was in the circumstances appropriate. 
    54   (b) Crofts direction 
     
      
     The direction that was given was as follows: 
      
       
       “I am bound to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that delay in complaining is something which you must take into account against the context of the fact that there may be very good reasons for delay, but of course that argument must be considered on both sides. The other side was put to you by Mr. Babb, there was never any complaint about any of these matters because they had not taken place. 
       
      
      
       
       But I must warn you, ladies and gentlemen, there may be good reason for failure to complain. It may be as NW said when he was cross-examined about his failure to mention the incident in the lounge room to his mother, that he was scared. It may be that one of the people you could expect him to complain to was the person whom he says was committing these acts against him. The fact that he did complain, ladies and gentlemen, is something that you can take into account when you come to assess his reliability as a witness. Mr. Babb says that you will l not accept it because it was not something which came spontaneously, but on his evidence it was something that arose only after his mother had asked him questions. It is a matter for you, ladies and gentlemen, however, the evidence is admitted to assist you in deciding whether his conduct was consistent with what he says happened and to answer any argument that the absence of complaint would suggest that the offence did not take place.” 
       
      
    55   Earlier his Honour had said: 
     
      
       
       “Consistency of account, ladies and gentlemen, may well be an indication of reliability, and inconsistency of account may be an indication of unreliability. If a witness has given an account at different times you might perhaps regard some inconsistency or variation in those accounts as being relevant to the reliability of the witness. It is a matter for you as the judges of the facts. Whilst on one hand a consistent story might indicate truthfulness, it might also possibly be a product of a conscious desire to maintain an untruthfulness. Some inconsistency might indicate unreliability. On the other hand some inconsistency might be consistent with an overall reliability and be no than an honest and inconsequential error or recollection.” 
       
      
      
       
      
    56   No redirection was sought, but prior to the commencement of the summing up, counsel for the appellant had sought a Crofts direction. In these circumstances, I would give leave to argue this ground, but find that the ground was not made out. In my view, when read in the light of the summing up as a whole, the balance was restored, as is required by Crofts; DJK Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 8 October 1998; Davies (1985) 3 NSWLR 276, and Lemura (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 18 December 1998) with the consequence that the jury were sufficiently instructed as to the manner in which the delay in complaint might adversely impact upon NW’s credibility. 
     
      
     (c) Longman Direction 
      
    57   It was submitted that his Honour failed sufficiently to underline, and explain, to the jury the significance of the delay in complaint, in accordance with the principles outlined in Longman (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 91, as more recently summarised in Johnston (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 31 July 1998) where Spigelman CJ, after reviewing the authorities concerning the aspect of delay, said, at 24 to 25: 
     
      
       
       “(i) Whenever it appears to a trial judge that delay, whether occasioned by delay in reporting a crime or otherwise, may have affected the fairness of a trial, he or she should make such comments and give such warnings as will ensure that the trial is fair. 
       
      
      
       
       (ii) A comment or warning is required if it appears to the trial judge that a jury may not, from its own experience, fully appreciate the effects of delay on the ability of the accused to defend himself or herself whether by testing prosecution evidence or adducing evidence in his own case, to establish a reasonable doubt about his or her guilt. 
       
      
      
       
       (iii) The need for, and content of, any comment will depend on the circumstances of the case. 
       
      
      
       
       (iv) Whether or not there is a need for any, and if so what, warning will also depend on the circumstances of the case. 
       
      
      
       
       (v) Where it appears from the course of evidence, including cross examination, or the conduct of the trial, including submissions, that specific difficulties were encountered by the accused in testing the evidence of the prosecution or adducing evidence in defence, then those specific difficulties should be highlighted in the summing up in such a way as makes it clear that delay, for which the accused had not been responsible, had created those difficulties. 
       
      
      
       
       (vi) Where the summing-up identifies difficulties pursuant to (v), the trial judge should indicate to the jury how they should approach their task of determining whether the prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt There is no universally applicable formula but some reference to the additional care or caution with which they should approach the prosecution evidence is usually appropriate. 
       
      
      
       
       (vii) In some cases a warning which uses terminology such as “dangerous” or “unsafe” to convict will be required. The reasons for the warning must be explained, generally by relating the danger to the specific difficulties of the character referred to in (v).” 
       
      
    58   It is true that his Honour did not specifically deal with the potential adverse effects for the defence, in relation to the delay in complaint. The case was not one, however, where any specific difficulties were identified that may have affected the ability of the appellant to test the evidence of the prosecution, or to adduce evidence in relation to the counts that were preserved. The defence case was one of deliberate concoction to assist NW’s mother in securing a separation. It was on that basis that the trial was fought, and nothing was identified then, or on appeal, to suggest that the appellant might have been prejudiced through delay: cf PAH (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 18 December 1998).59   Although it would have been desirable for his Honour to have adverted, in a little more detail to the aspect of delay, no request for any further warning was made by experienced trial Counsel.60   In these circumstances I am ofthe view that sufficient instruction was given to the jury by way of a Murray direction concerning the general need to scrutinise the evidence of the complainant with care (at pp. 7 to 8 of the summing up), and by the Crofts direction concerning the consistency or inconsistency of conduct associated with the complaint previously mentioned. 
     
      
     (d) S 165 Evidence Act submission 
      
    61   Next it was submitted that his Honour failed sufficiently to identify the matters that may have impacted on the reliability of the complainant’s evidence, eg in not reminding the jury that two counts had been withdrawn because the evidence of the complainant could not fit with known facts, that the time frame for three counts had necessarily been amended because of the variations in his evidence when compared with the account he had given to police, and that his evidence lacked precision and was vague as to times. 
    62   No request was made under S165(2) of the Evidence Act for any warning that the evidence of the complainant may be unreliable for any of the reasons specified in S165(1). While that does not mean that his Honour was excused from bringing to attention any matter, whether referred to in S165(1) or otherwise (Vawdrey Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 16 April 1998) that may have affected its reliability where it was necessary in the interest of fairness to do so, (BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131; Davis [1999] NSWCCA 15 and Williams [1999] NSWCCA 9, proper regard still needs to be given to the judgment of trial Counsel, who is best placed to gauge the effect and adequacy of the summing up, and upon whom a responsibility exists to request any relevant direction or warning: PAH (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 18 December 1998).] 
    63   It is clear that S165 was not overlooked at the trial, as his Honour gave an express warning based upon it, in relation to so much of the evidence of SW as was of a hearsay nature. Otherwise, the jury were given a Murray warning, and were reminded of several matters of inconsistency or uncertainty that had been pressed by the appellant. This followed a direction to the effect that inconsistency in the evidence of a witness may affect his credibility. 
    64   There is no reason to suppose that the jury had overlooked the fact that directed verdicts had been returned for two counts, or that amendments were allowed in relation to three other counts. The warnings given concerning inconsistency, and the standard direction given concerning the ability of the jury to accept part of the evidence of a witness and to reject part, were in my view sufficient. Moreover, it remains the fact that where a danger, such as unreliability is obvious to the lay mind, the lack of any specific reference to it is diminished in its significance: Bromley (1986) 161 CLR 315 at 325. 
    65   For these reasons grounds 3 and 3A have not been made good. 
     
     Ground 4 Lies 
      
    66   This ground relates to the directions given by his Honour concerning answers given by the appellant that were relied upon as lies. 
    67   Two matters were relied on as lies by the Crown. They related to the evidence he gave at the trial: 
     
      
     (a) that he had never slept with NW on the couch in the loungeroom, evidence to the contrary having been given by SW; and 
      
      
     (b) that the tattoo on his penis was legible, evidence that was directly contradicted by his own answers in the ERISP, and by the evidence of SW. 
      
    68   The evidence of SW concerning these two matters was not challenged in cross examination, and it was well open to the jury to conclude that the appellant had lied. 
    69   In the directions that were given, his Honour dealt clearly and appropriately with each of the elements required in a case where a jury is invited to take a lie into account as indicating a consciousness of guilt, and as providing support for the evidence of a complainant, ie in accordance with the principles established in Preval (1984) 3 NSWLR 647, Sutton (1986) 5 NSWLR 697, Edwards (1993) 178 CLR 193, Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234, ST (1997) 92 A Crim R 390 and Green [1999] HCA 13. 
    70   The complaint went primarily to their use for this purpose, it being submitted that his Honour should have confined the evidence to the issue of the credibility of the appellant as a witness. It does seem that, at one stage, his Honour was minded to confine the use of lies in this fashion, but was ultimately persuaded to leave them on the broader basis. 
    71   I am quite unpersuaded that his Honour fell into error in taking this course. The matters relied upon were directly relevant to the occurrence of the offences - the first because it was the occasion of sleeping together on the couch that provided the opportunity for the offence charged in count 1; the second because the fact that NW was able to read the tattoo on his father’s penis meant that his face was close to it, at groin height, as he described in particular for the offence charged in count 2. 
    72   It was submitted somewhat faintly that his Honour failed to provide sufficient guidance as to the way in which either lie might indicate a consciousness of guilt. I am unable to agree with that submission. His Honour appropriately reminded the jury that the mere fact that the appellant told a lie was not enough, and went on to say: 
     
      
       
       “But I should tell you that there may be reasons for telling a lie quite apart from any realisation of guilt. It can sometimes arise, as we all know, ladies and gentlemen, out of a situation of panic. If you find that it arose out of panic or for some other reason, and if you accept that that is an explanation for the lie, then you cannot regard the lie as an admission so far as the accused is concerned.” 
       
      
    73   Later in the summing up, at the request of the Crown Prosecutor, his Honour emphasised that the jury had to be satisfied that any lie told by the appellant had been deliberate, and was shown by evidence independent of the complainant to have been a lie. There was little more that his Honour could have done in this regard. This ground accordingly fails. 
     
     Ground 5 
      
    74   It was submitted, finally, that the verdict was “unsafe and unsatisfactory”. 
    75   This ground needs to be considered in the light of the observations of the High Court in Fleming (1998) 158 ALR 379, concerning the expression “unsafe and unsatisfactory”. There it was said, at 382 to 383: 
     
      
       
       “The fundamental point is that close attention must be paid to the language of s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 
       . 
        Use of the potentially confusing phrase ‘unsafe and unsatisfactory’ to cover the several different elements in the subsection is liable to mislead. There is no substitute for giving attention to the precise terms in which s6(1) is expressed.” 
       
      
    76   The legislative framework under which this ground is available is contained in the following provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act: 
     
      
       
       “Section 5(1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the Court: 
       
      
      
       
       (a) against the person’s conviction on any ground which involves a question of law alone, and 
       
      
      
       
       (b) with the leave of the court, or upon the certificate of the judge of the court of trial that it is a fit case for appeal against the person’s conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone, or question of mixed law and fact, or any other ground which appears to the court to be a sufficient ground of appeal, and 
       
      
      
       
       (c) … 
       
      
      … 
      
      
       
       Section 6 (1) The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) Subject to the special provisions of this Act, the court shall, if it allows an appeal under section 5(1) against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered. 
       
      
      
       
       … 
       
      
      
       
       Section 8(1): On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.” 
       
      
    77   In Johnston, Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
       “Considering what order should be made the Court must have in mind the interconnection between s6 and s8 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Subsection 6(2) states that the Court ‘shall’ direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal, but this is ‘subject to the special provision’s of the Act’. Section 8 is a ‘special provision’ and provides that a new trial may be ordered if the miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order, relevantly, a verdict of acquittal.” 
       
      
      
     As his Honour also observed in  
     Giam 
      [1999] NSW CCA 53: 
      
      
       
       “Much of what has hitherto been identified under the ‘unsafe and unsatisfactory’ ground of appeal is encompassed within the formulation in s6(1) of ‘on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice.” 
       
      
    78   It has been convenient to use the ‘unsafe and unsatisfactory’ formulation in the past, for the purposes of separately identifying a ground of appeal that depends upon the verdict being unsupported on the evidence, or that depends upon drawing on the other grounds of appeal in a cumulative way, in either case so as to justify a verdict of acquittal or an order for a new trial. (see Giam [1999] NSW CCA 53).79   It was because of the imprecision involved in the expression “unsafe and unsatisfactory”, and the lack of any specific legislative basis for it, that Spigelman CJ in Giam adverted to the need to identify the ground of appeal relied upon with an appropriate degree of particularity, as well as the need to specify the nature of the order sought should the appeal succeed. 
    80   In this case, two aspects of the ground were relied upon. The first depended upon an accumulation of the matters catalogued in the other grounds, which it was said together resulted in a miscarriage of justice, in the sense referred to in Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396. If established it would lead to an order for a new trial. The second basis which, if made good, would entitle the appellant to an acquittal, turned upon the test, settled in M (1994) 181 CLR 487 and Jones (1997) 72 ALJR 78, namely whether, after making its own independent review of the evidence, this Court concluded that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. 
    81   As to the first basis, I am not satisfied, for the reasons already mentioned, that the errors identified in the remaining grounds were established, or that as a consequence there was a miscarriage of justice. 
    82   I observe, in this regard, that grounds of appeal found to be lacking in substance do not acquire any greater significance or worth when added to other grounds. The tendency which appears to have emerged of identifying as many grounds of appeal as possible, no matter how spurious, and then suggesting that in accumulation they establish a miscarriage of justice, needs to be firmly discouraged. Before an appeal will be upheld upon this basis, the appellant must positively demonstrate that there were errors in the conduct of the trial, relating to the admission (or rejection of) evidence or in the sufficiency or correctness of the summing up, or otherwise leading to a miscarriage of justice of such a kind and degree that it would be inappropriate to apply the proviso: Wilde (1988) 164 CLR 365. 
    83   I am similarly unpersuaded as to the second basis upon which this ground was advanced. Although somewhat imprecise as to times, as might have been expected, the complainant did not move from the central aspects of his evidence. Where he had no memory, he was frankly prepared to say so. On the other hand the appellant’s evidence was not without its problems. The advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the witnesses, and in particular in assessing the credibility of the complainant and the appellant, should in this case, be respected: Chidiac (1991) 171 CLR 432 at 432-434 and Jones at 94. With this in mind, and noting that such inconsistency or vagueness as were present did not affect the central elements of the events described, I am unable to conclude, subject to the matter next mentioned, that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt. 
    84   In relation to count 4, a problem does arise from the circumstance that the complainant could not remember the year in which the incident occurred. The best that he could do was to say that he “was about ten” at the time. In the reasons for sentence, his Honour said that he was “satisfied that this offence occurred during the victim’s ninth year”. By their verdict the jury must similarly be taken to have reached the same conclusion. However, the evidence of the complainant left open the possibility that it occurred after his tenth birthday. In those circumstances, I am of the view that a conviction for an offence requiring proof, beyond reasonable doubt, that the complainant was under the age of ten years, was unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
    85   However, since the jury were satisfied that the conduct charged did occur, the appellant would properly have been convicted of the alternative and lesser offence available under s 78K Crimes Act, ie homosexual intercourse with a male person aged ten years or over but less than eighteen years. A conviction for this alternative is permissible under S 78J Crimes Act 1900. Although raised peripherally in argument, and not subject to any considered submission, I am not persuaded by the proposition that where the jury are satisfied that the conduct charged did occur, but are left uncertain whether the complainant was aged under or over ten years, they must return a verdict of acquittal of any offence. 
    86   The age is a matter of aggravation, attracting additional consequences by way of penalty. Where the jury is in doubt only as to whether the complainant was of an age that would attract an aggravation of penalty, then I am of the view that they could convict of the lesser offence, i.e. without the factor of aggravation. 
    87   For these reasons, I would uphold the appeal against conviction in respect of count four, and substitute therefore a conviction for homosexual intercourse with a male aged between ten years and under eighteen years.  
    88   This requires a review of the sentence imposed. I would substitute for the sentence imposed a fixed term of penal servitude for eighteen months. I would not, however, alter any of the remaining sentences. The principle of totality does require that there be taken into account the circumstance that, for one offence, there was lacking the factor of aggravation mentioned. I am, however, of the view that the difference in objective criminality involved is not sufficient to require any reduction in the overall sentencing order. It was, in my view, one that was appropriate to reflect the overall objective and subjective criminality of the appellant, who, I observe, had been previously convicted of a similar offence involving another child. 
    89   Accordingly, I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
     1) Appeal in respect of Count four, be allowed and conviction for that count be quashed. In lieu conviction in respect of an offence of homosexual intercourse with a male person aged ten years or above but under the age of eighteen years be substituted; 
      
     2) Leave be granted to appeal in respect of sentence;3) Sentence in respect of Count 4 be quashed. In lieu appellant be sentenced in respect of that count to a fixed term of penal servitude of eighteen months to date from 22 October 1997, and to expire on 21 April1999.Otherwise, appeal against conviction and sentence be dismissed. 
    90   BARR J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL. 
    91   GREG JAMES J: I have had the opportunity to see the draft judgment of the Chief Judge. I agree with him.

     REGINA v Antoinette MANSOUR 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed on the applicant by his Honour Judge Viney QC in the District Court in Sydney on 6 November 1998. The applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s52A(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for that offence is ten years. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of two years and an additional term of two years. 
     
      
    2    The findings of fact by his Honour were not challenged in any way. It is not necessary to set them out in full in this judgment. Pages 1-5.3 of his Honour's remarks on sentence of 6 November 1998 should be taken as if incorporated herein. 
     
      
    3    The first ground of appeal was an allegation that the sentencing judge took into account irrelevant material. This is based on the following comments by his Honour during the course of his remarks on sentence. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I think it is fair to say that the result of this collision and the loss of that young lady's life has caused what can only be described as immeasurable grief to her family. The material in the form of Victim impact statements supports that situation"". 
        
       
      
    4    This passage in his Honour's reasons occurs immediately after his summary of the facts and immediately before his reference to the case in Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and to the sentencing guidelines therein contained, to which I will further refer. It was submitted that his Honour's reference to ""immeasurable grief"" indicated that his Honour had taken into account an irrelevant consideration in arriving at the sentence. This submission should be rejected. 
     
      
    5    In Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510, Hunt CJ at CL referred to his earlier decision in Previtera (1997) 94 ACrimR 76 to the effect that the Victim Impact Statement is not relevant to sentence. When applying the principle to the facts before him in the case of Bollen, however, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""When referring to the Victim Impact Statements, the judge said that the consequence of the crime committed by the Appellant was that the community had lost one of its number and the Groves family had lost a loving member - one who was a husband, father, son and brother. I see nothing wrong with that statement. It does no more than recognise the value which the community places upon human life. However, the judge then said that he had 'borne in mind' the seven statements filed, the material which they contained about the deceased and the reaction of the respective authors of those statements to his death. He went on to describe the statements as useful because of the involvement which they permitted of the family 'in a criminal justice process' and also because 'they helped remind the sentencing judges that the loss of any individual has real effect upon others'. He referred to the counselling and medical attention they had received, and continued: 
        
       
       
        
        'Naturally, the seven statements were written at a time when the authors anticipated the verdict would be murder. They will, of course, understand that the prisoner must be dealt with consistently with the jury's verdict, and also that I must proceed dispassionately no matter how strongly they feel.' 
        
       
       
        
        I am satisfied that, by bearing this material in mind and by having regard to the particular effects of the death of the deceased upon the members of his family, the judge had taken irrelevant material into account and thus fallen into error."" 
        
       
      
    6    In the present case, there is no language in the judgment which would suggest that Viney DCJ had taken into account the contents of the victim statements in the manner referred to above. Rather, the reference to ""immeasurable grief"" is equivalent to the ""recognition of impact"", referred to by Hunt CJ at CL in the first three sentences of the above extract from Bollen. 
     
      
    7    It is entirely appropriate that trial judges acknowledge the impact of crime on victims and their families in this public way. The purposes of the criminal justice system are well served by such public recognition of the grief imposed on families of victims. Unlike Bollen, there is nothing in the judgment to suggest that his Honour gave this consideration weight in determining the sentence eventually imposed. To infer that he did so would be to draw an inference from what is submitted to be a manifestly excessive sentence, but if it is a manifestly excessive sentence then it falls for that reason, rather than by reason of some inference about his Honour's reasoning process that can be derived from its manifestly excessive character. 
     
      
    8    The second ground of appeal was that the sentence was manifestly excessive, as I have just mentioned. This was in part based on the application of what was submitted to be the reasoning of this Court in Jurisic. Specifically, attention was directed to what was submitted to be the powerful subjective features of this case. Indeed, it was submitted that the circumstances of the case were sufficiently exceptional to justify a non-custodial sentence, or at least a sentence of either home detention or periodic detention. 
     
      
    9    His Honour Judge Viney referred to the then recent decision of this Court in Jurisic and said it contained a list of aggravating factors that the Court must take into account. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""As I understand it, these aggravating features are those which would raise the level of the conduct above what is sometimes called merely momentary inattention constituting dangerous driving. In this case I am satisfied that the aggravating features are that the prisoner driving at least 100kms per hour over a distance of 1-1 and a half kms prior to the collision on a wet road; overtaking one lorry at high speed and cutting in just in front of an approaching vehicle; continuing to drive fast through the winding section of the road despite a warning sign recommending a maximum speed of 65kms per hour; and at least two drivers flashing their lights at her during the overtaking mentioned. In addition such driving clearly put at risk other road users who might be expected to be on the road at that time."" 
        
       
      
    10    The time was at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon on a week day. His Honour had, just before this passage, recited in the statement of facts the critical event, which was that the applicant's vehicle had crossed to the incorrect side of the roadway colliding with the other vehicle. The victim had applied the brakes to the point of locking the wheels of her vehicle before the fatal impact. 
     
      
    11    Guideline judgments of this Court are not precedents binding on lower courts. (See Jurisic supra pp220-221; Henry (1999) NSWCCA 111 at paras 29-31). The failure to sentence in accordance with the guideline is not itself a ground of appeal. It does not constitute a legal error which of itself would justify interference with the exercise of discretion such as the sentencing task. (See Henry supra at paras 22-30). 
     
      
    12    The submissions of the applicant relied on the statement in Henry at par 31 that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Where a guideline is not to be applied by a trial judge, this Court would expect that the reasons for that decision be articulated, so that the public interest in the perception of consistency in sentencing decisions can be served and this Court can be properly informed in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction."" 
        
       
      
    13    It is submitted that Viney DCJ did not apply the guideline and failed to give reasons for failing to do so. In my opinion, this submission should be rejected. 
     
      
    14    In his reasons for decision, immediately after setting out the aggravating factors as quoted above, Viney DCJ went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am not prepared to go so far as to find that those aggravating features manifest that Mrs Mansour had abandoned responsibility for her own conduct as was set out or indicated in  
        Jurisic 
        , but it shows a degree of recklessness certainly above any concept of momentary inattention."" 
        
       
      
    15    The guidelines promulgated in Jurisic were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. A non-custodial sentence for an offence against s52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgment. 
        
       
       
        
        2. With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional."" 
        
       
      
    16    The reference to ""present to a material degree"" was explained in terms of ""the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct"". (231D and F). This formulation in Jurisic must not be treated as if they were words contained in a statute which fall to be construed by sentencing judges. They are guidelines meant to be indicators only. 
     
      
    17    His Honour indicated, with considerable force, the reasons why the conduct of the applicant on the fatal occasion could not satisfy a description of ""momentary inattention or misjudgment"", a test which had been referred to in a long line of cases prior to Jurisic. On that basis, it was well within the exercise of his Honour's discretion to conclude that a non-custodial sentence was entirely inappropriate in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    18    If, as will presently appear, it falls to this court to re-exercise the sentence discretion, I would agree for the same reasons as mentioned by his Honour that a non-custodial sentence was not appropriate The course of irresponsible driving in this case was plainly, as his Honour said, well beyond any concept of momentary inattention. 
     
      
    19    The substantive submission put before the Court was that the second guideline in Jurisic, as quoted above, suggests that where conduct of the offender could not be described as ""abandoning responsibility for her conduct"" then a custodial sentence of more than three years should be regarded as excessive. The submission was made that his Honour's actual finding of fact indicated that the circumstances of the offence in the present case never reached the level at which a three year sentence was said to be appropriate and, accordingly, a sentence of four years was excessive. These submissions misconstrue the nature and purpose of the guideline as set out in Jurisic. That guideline, in terms, states that where conduct can be described in terms of the ""abandonment of responsibility"" then a sentence of less than three years ""should be exceptional"". That does not state, nor does it suggest, that unless conduct reaches the level of ""abandoning responsibility"" then a sentence of less than three years is required. 
     
      
    20    This is particularly the case as the second guideline relates only to circumstances in which ""wherever there is present to a material degree an aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender"". In Jurisic at p231, nine aggravating factors are listed and it is said at 231D that only paras (iii)-(ix) were factors referring ""to the conduct of the offender"". Two of the aggravating factors, in what was not stated to be in any way a comprehensive list, were expressly identified as objective factors not involving the conduct of the offender and, accordingly, not relevant to the threshold requirement in the second guideline. These two factors were: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Number of people put at risk. 
        
       
      
    21    These are matters going beyond the list of aggravating factors which are to be taken into account for the purposes of the threshold. In the present case, the element of number of people put at risk is of significance. The irresponsible driving occurred at a peak time for traffic and there was evidence of the applicant weaving in and out of traffic. His Honour expressly found again that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Such driving clearly put at risk other road users who might be expected to be on that road at that time"". 
        
       
      
    22    Not only was there nothing in the guideline to suggest that a trial judge was in any way constrained to impose a sentence of less than three years, unless there was an express finding of abandonment of responsibility, in its terms other material factors to which express reference is made in Jurisic had to be taken into account, going beyond the matters to which the guideline expressly referred. 
     
      
    23    I turn now to the submission that the sentence is manifestly excessive. A list of subjective features of the case were put before the Court to support the submission that they had not been given proper weight. These were summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Plea of guilty. 
         
         
        2. Genuine contrition, remorse and shock. 
         
         
        3. No traffic infringement over a period of 23 years of driving. 
         
         
        4. No previous criminal convictions. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Blameless life and significant positive contribution to family, extended family and to the community lending assistance in church and children's schools and in charitable work. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Serious injuries to the applicant herself in the accident and her medical condition and psychological suffering as a result of her involvement in the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        7. A wife and mother of three children, including two young school age children. 
        
       
      
    24    This is a powerful subjective case. All of these matters are, however, referred to by his Honour. His Honour did note, I should say, that the value of the plea of guilty was diminished to some extent by the fact that immediately after the accident, the applicant made a statement placing responsibility for the collision upon the victim. Indeed she asserted, contrary to the fact, that the victim had been travelling on the wrong side of the road. Although this was subsequently withdrawn and the plea of guilty filed, nevertheless this was a factor which his Honour indicated, limited the value of the plea of guilty to some degree. The matters urged upon the Court in this regard were also expressly taken into account in his Honour's findings of special circumstances, with respect to which there is no challenge. 
     
      
    25    In substance, the submission is reduced to a submission to the effect that in all the circumstances the sentence of four years is excessive. The occasions on which the Court will intervene with the exercise of a discretion on that basis are extremely limited. We would have to find that this sentence was above the permissible range. In my view, taking into account the very strong subjective features of this case it is. I don't wish to give emphasis only to the following matters, but of some significance are the fact that over a period of 23 years there has been no traffic infringement of any character and her positive contribution to her family and the broader community, together with what appears to be genuine contrition, remorse and shock and the effect of the event on the applicant, these are matters entitled to considerable weight. Although his Honour referred to each of these matters, it appears to me that looking at the judgment as a whole he failed to give them appropriate weight in the particular circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    26    The driving was irresponsible. It was much more irresponsible than anything that would justify a non-custodial sentence and, most significantly of all, of course, it led to the death of an innocent person. That event establishes that the punishment in these circumstances should be condign. 
     
      
    27    The maximum sentence which Parliament prescribed for this particular offence is ten years. In my opinion, his Honour was quite correct to find that nothing in the nature of momentary inattention occurred in this case. There has to be a custodial sentence of some length. For the reasons which his Honour gave, I make a finding of special circumstances in this case. 
     
      
    28    As in all of these sorts of matters, the task of balancing the full range of relevant objective circumstances and the significant subjective circumstances that were urged below and in this Court on behalf of the applicant, calls for an exercise of judgment on which reasonable minds may differ. However, once this Court has decided that it should intervene on the basis that the sentence below was manifestly excessive in all of the circumstances of the case, then the discretion of this Court falls to be exercised afresh. 
     
      
    29    In my view, taking into account all of the various factors set out in the statement of facts by his Honour that I have incorporated in this judgment and the findings of fact that his Honour made and specifically his finding that it could not be said that Mrs Mansour had abandoned responsibility for her own conduct, notwithstanding the degree of irresponsibility involved in the driving on this occasion, I have come to the conclusion that the appropriate sentence is a sentence of 12 months imprisonment as a minimum term and an additional term of 12 months. 
     
      
    30    In my view, the appeal should be allowed, the sentence quashed. I would substitute a sentence of two years imprisonment comprising a minimum term of 12 months commencing on 6 November 1998 and expiring on 5 November 1999 and an additional term of 12 months commencing on 6 November 1999 and expiring on 5 November 2000. Pursuant to section 24 of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW), the Court should direct the release of the appellant on parole at the end of the minimum term. I would make the order, as his Honour did, that the period of disqualification of two years would stand. I would not interfere with that order. 
     
      
    31    STUDDERT J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    32    ADAMS: I also agree. 
     
      
    33    SPIGELMAN: The orders are as I have indicated.

     070212/98 - REGINA v CHOI KIA TANG 
      
       
    REMARKS ON SENTENCE1     HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, Choi Kia Tang, has been found guilty by a jury of the murder of David Laxalle at Berala on 24 February 1997. 
     
      
       
      
    2     For some months prior to his death Mr Laxalle had been living with his mother at 19 McDonald Street Berala, following the breakdown of his marriage. On the night of Sunday, 23 February 1997, the prisoner and three young companions were stealing mangoes from trees in the backyard of that home. Mr Laxalle observed this and pursued the men into McDonald Street. He seized one of them and there was a struggle, in which the prisoner and the other two men engaged themselves.  
     
      
       
      
    3     It is unnecessary to examine in any detail the evidence of what then occurred. It is sufficient to say that Mr Laxalle was punched and fell to the ground, where he was kicked. In a videotaped interview with police at the scene, which he adopted in the trial as his best recollection of these events, the prisoner claimed that Mr Laxalle seized him by the shirt and punched him in the head. For his part, he admitted having punched Mr Laxalle in the head and having kicked him two or three times to the head and body. 
     
      
       
      
    4     In the course of the struggle Mr Laxalle was stabbed seven times to the torso and upper left arm. In the light of the jury’s verdict, I am satisfied that it was the prisoner who inflicted all of those wounds. One of the other young men admitted having a knife, but I could not fairly conclude that he used it. Even if he had, it would have no significant bearing upon the prisoner’s culpability. 
     
      
       
      
    5     Mr Laxalle managed to make his way back to his mother’s home, where she ministered to him as best she could and summoned help. Sadly, it was necessary for her to give evidence about this in the trial. He was conveyed by ambulance to Westmead Hospital, where he died the following morning. 
     
      
       
      
    6     For the purpose of sentence, I accept that the prisoner became involved in the attack to free his companion and that Mr Laxalle did strike him. This in no way excuses his behaviour but it underlines the spontaneous nature of the attack, during which, no doubt, the prisoner was in a state of high emotion. I have no idea why he had a knife that night, as he has never admitted that he did. However, there is no basis upon which I could find that he was carrying it with the intention of stabbing anyone. From the jury’s verdict it follows that he intended to inflict at least grievous bodily harm upon Mr Laxalle but, despite the number and nature of the wounds, I am not satisfied that he intended to kill. 
     
      
       
      
    7     This is not to ignore the community’s abhorrence of young men carrying knives in circumstances such as these. That abhorrence is justified by the type of situation which brings the prisoner before this Court: an unexpected eruption of violence leading to the use of a knife aggressively and, far too often, fatally. The sentence which I pass, whilst recognising the spontaneous nature of this killing, must reflect that community concern. 
     
      
       
      
    8     The prisoner was eighteen years old at the time of the incident, and is now twenty. His three companions were sixteen years old at the time. Each of them pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was dealt with by a non-custodial order. Clearly, the prisoner stands in a very different position and must face a substantial custodial sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    9     The prisoner has a minor record in the Children’s Court, which is of no present significance. He was born in Cambodia, the youngest of eight children. It seems that his father was killed by the Pol Pot regime. At the age of six he came to this country with his mother and most of his siblings. He has no memory of his father or, indeed, of his country of origin. 
     
      
       
      
    10     As one would expect, this background had an adverse effect upon his family life. His mother was a stressful person and they were in financial difficulty. He had difficulty communicating with his mother, who never learnt English, and he felt unable to provide her with the support and sympathy she deserved from her experiences in Cambodia. Despite this, he progressed satisfactorily at school, completing the school certificate. On leaving school, he obtained employment and at the time of his arrest he was undertaking a trade course conducted by the Commonwealth Employment Service.  
     
      
       
      
    11     From the age of twelve he had had the benefit of attendance at residential camps for disadvantaged children arranged by the Uniting Church. At the trial his counsel led oral evidence and tendered a number of testimonials from people involved in that program, all of whom had observed him to be industrious, courteous and helpful. Mr Robert Urquhart, who gave oral evidence, said that his reliability led to his being appointed a volunteer youth leader at the camps, and that he had never seen him act aggressively. Clearly, his behaviour at the time of this tragic incident was out of character. 
     
      
       
      
    12     A psychological report by Ms Katherine Barrier, prepared for the purpose of sentence, reveals that the prisoner is of below average intelligence and lacks self-esteem. He had been living away from the family home in the period leading up to the killing and, on the history he provided to Ms Barrier, he appears to have been under pressure from a shortage of money and the competing demands of his job, his course and his family commitments. Ms Barrier considered that he is in need of counselling which, I trust, will be available to him in prison.  
     
      
       
      
    13     It is pleasing to note that, since he has been in custody, he has been furthering his general education and has enjoyed the continuing support of his family. Although his prospects of rehabilitation are good, I consider that that end would be furthered by an extended period of supervision and the sanction of parole after he has served the custodial component of his sentence. Accordingly, I find special circumstances within the meaning of s5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989, although only a minor departure from the statutory norm is warranted.  
     
      
       
      
    14     The sentence which I pass must reflect the gravity of his crime, while giving appropriate weight to his age, his background and character, and the desirability of his rehabilitation. All those matters must also be reflected in the minimum term, bearing in mind that his release on parole is a matter for the Parole Board, not for me. The sentence will date from the date he was taken into custody, 23 March 1997. 
     
      
       
      
    15     Choi Kia Tang, you are sentenced to penal servitude for fifteen years, comprising a minimum term of eleven years, commencing on 23 March 1997 and expiring on 22 March 2008, and an additional term of four years, commencing on 23 March 2008 and expiring on 22 March 2012.

    1    GROVE J :  This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed upon the applicant by McGuire DCJ at the Gosford District Court on 1 May 1998. On that occasion the applicant adhered to a plea of guilty previously given to a magistrate on a charge of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s 97 of the Crimes Act. That offence carries a prescribed maximum penalty of twenty years penal servitude. 
     
      
       
      
    2    His Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of five years penal servitude comprising minimum and additional term components of three and two years respectively. Accordingly, his Honour granted the applicant the benefit of a potentially longer time out of custody on parole than would be the case if the proportions mentioned in s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act were applied. No challenge was made to his Honour's finding of special circumstances justifying departure from the statutory formula.  
     
      
       
      
    3    The facts of the offence were set out in a statement tendered by consent in the District Court which were incorporated in the learned Judge's remarks on sentence. I will not repeat the entire content thereof and a short sketch will suffice for present purposes.  
     
      
       
      
    4    At about 8.30pm on a Saturday evening the applicant walked into a pharmacy which was tended by the seventy year old wife of the pharmacist. The applicant demanded money and produced a pocket knife which he brandished in response to the victim's refusal to open the till accompanying his actions by threats to ""cut her"". He tried to open the till by forcing it with the blade.  
     
      
       
      
    5    The victim's husband who was presumably of similar years came from the rear of the store in response to the commotion and the applicant fled. Hue and cry was raised and an off duty policewoman who was walking in company with her boyfriend apprehended the applicant and placed him under arrest. The knife was found in his pocket.  
     
      
       
      
    6    The applicant had some prior record including convictions for administering a prohibited drug (heroin) and possessing a prohibited drug (cannabis) in 1986. In 1995 he was placed on a recognizance to be of good behaviour for three years for an offence of breaking, entering and stealing. That recognizance was current at the time of the present offence.  
     
      
       
      
    7    It is convenient to deal with a written submission on behalf of the applicant which asserts that: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""There is only one aggravating factor - the applicant was on a bond at the time of the offence. That is not a significant aggravating factor in this case because the three year recognizance imposed on 5 April 1995 had almost been completed at the time of the offence on 7 February 1998."" 
         
        
       
      
    8    The submission appears to advance the proposition that the existence of current recognizance was insignificant. I reject the contention. It may be a matter of greater aggravation that an offender commits further crime shortly after being given the benefit of lenient treatment but it is simply not insignificant in any sense that the very terms upon which lenience has been granted continue to be applicable at the time of offence. The contention that there was only one aggravating factor involves a very restricted meaning of the word ""aggravating"".  
     
      
       
      
    9    The applicant is forty three years of age. He is claimed to have been a ""heroin addict intermittently"" for fifteen years. I have some difficulty also with that expression. What I take it to mean is that from time to time over a span of fifteen years he succumbed to urges to partake of illicit drugs.  
     
      
       
      
    10    As observed by counsel for the Crown, the sentence imposed was within the guidelines formulated by this court in R v Henry & ors (1999) NSW CCA 111. An approach is to consider the guideline range established by this court and determine a sentence above or below that range in accordance with the aggravating and mitigating factors found. In this case aggravating factors included the use of the knife, the vulnerability of the mature aged victim, the circumstances of the threat of force whilst the weapon was being brandished and an effect upon the victim as described in her statement to police and their observation that she was visibly shaken and upset.  
     
      
       
      
    11    Factors in favour of the applicant included his plea of guilty and admissions to police although the value of these in circumstances where the applicant was arrested in flight from the scene of the crime would in my view be low.  
     
      
       
      
    12    The learned sentencing Judge took into account the applicant’s remorse and the steps he had taken towards rehabilitation. The contention of the applicant does not suggest that his Honour did not take into account all relevant matters and the complaint is that the sentence does not adequately reflect them. 
     
      
       
      
    13    One matter raised on the appeal is the suggestion that there ought to have been a discount under s 442B of the Crimes Act for assistance to the authorities. All that was involved was the circumstance that the applicant nominated his drug dealer to police. His explanation for the crime was that he needed to acquire money to discharge a present debt to his supplier. His Honour expressly stated that it was a matter which would stand the applicant in good stead although it is clear that what has been described as assistance was minor and its reflection would have to be proportionate to that quality. 
     
      
       
      
    14    I earlier mentioned the claimed drug addiction of the applicant as well as the observation by the sentencing Judge that the applicant had made strides towards rehabilitation. It has often been said that drug addiction supplies a possible explanation for crime but does not provide a mitigating factor. It is true that in R v Henry & ors Wood CJ at CL observed that a need to fund a drug habit may be relevant as a subjective circumstance but, as already noted, subjective matters including the steps of the applicant towards rehabilitation were taken into account.  
     
      
       
      
    15    Next I should make reference to some statistics from the Judicial Commission which are relied upon by counsel for the applicant. It is asserted that by reference to some extracted statistics the applicant can be assessed as having received a sentence towards the top ten to fifteen percent of all offenders and it is said that this is manifestly excessive when one takes into account the subjective matters in the applicant's favour.  
     
      
       
      
    16    In his succinct submission Mr Strickland of counsel said that that was the principal thrust of the appeal, namely, that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In my view it was not.  
     
      
       
      
    17    Sentencing is an exercise in judgment and not in statistics. Many of the figures which contributed towards the Judicial Commission statistics would necessarily be taken from cases determined prior to the guideline judgment in R v Henry & ors. Such judgments are provoked not only by the need to provide reference points for consistency but also to correct emergent patterns of undue leniency. That is not to say that a guideline judgment may not at some time be required to reflect an undue pattern of severity. The latter was not a factor giving rise to the judgment in Henry. 
     
      
       
      
    18    It should be recognised that guideline judgments are just that. Various factors relevant to sentence are scheduled in such judgments but they do not represent nor do they purport to represent a complete litany of possible factors against which the exercise of discretionary judgment is to be measured. 
     
      
       
      
    19    The words of Samuels JA in Thorley, CCA 5 February 1991, still have their validity: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""It is necessary for appellate courts to permit the sentencing judges a proper range of discretion. Our duty is to correct error, not to satisfy the individual preferences of appellate judges."" 
         
        
       
      
    20    Argument was addressed on the basis that the applicant fulfilled all of certain criteria mentioned in Henry except one, namely, that he was not a young offender. The guideline range expressly related to offenders who are young and the relevance to the applicant at all is debatable. However on any basis the sentence was not manifestly excessive. I am of the view that the imposition reflects a sound exercise of discretion by the sentencing judge.  
     
      
       
      
    21    I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    22    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    23    GROVE J: The orders of the court will be as I have proposed.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Mitchelmore DCJ in the Penrith District Court on 21 August 1998. On that occasion the applicant had pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. The maximum prescribed penalty for each of those offences was eleven years imprisonment. The aggravated element of the crimes was driving a vehicle whilst there was present in the blood of the applicant a higher concentration of alcohol than 0.15 percent. Testing showed his blood alcohol level reading to be 0.263 percent. That is considerably in excess of the threshold of aggravation and, as noted by the sentencing judge, represents an excess by a multiple of five of the prescribed limit for driving a motor vehicle upon a public street.  
     
      
       
      
    2    The applicant was sentenced to four years imprisonment divided into minimum and additional terms of two years to be served concurrently on each count.  
     
      
       
      
    3    The offences arose out of the same incident on 25 June 1997 when a vehicle driven by the applicant came into collision with another. The driver of the second vehicle was a young woman aged 19 years. She suffered a fractured skull and injuries to the right eye, the damage to which resulted in its blindness. The victim in the second count was the de facto wife of the applicant who was riding as a passenger. They had been together during the day and after shopping met at about llam at the Macquarie Arms Hotel in Windsor. The time of the accident was approaching 7pm. 
     
      
       
      
    4    The applicant is aged 45 years and is a removalist by occupation. He was in permanent casual employment. He has been a professional driver for many years. Despite presumably long periods on the road he had a driving record which was clear but for a single offence of exceeding the speed limit in June 1985. The pleas of guilty were entered at the earliest opportunity.  
     
      
       
      
    5    Unsurprisingly, the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant has focused upon the decision of this court in R v Jurisic (1999) 101 A Crim R 269. It is perhaps important to mention that that decision was in its terms a guideline judgment and did not purport to usurp the authority of the Parliament to specify offence and to prescribe penalty. The judgment in particular of the Chief Justice did set out a number of factors which ought to be taken into consideration in order to determine appropriate penalty.  
     
      
       
      
    6    The submissions on behalf of the appellant have been couched in an examination of the individual ingredients of the matters taken into overall account as mentioned in Jurisic but it is important not to lose sight of the circumstance that the reference is ultimately to guideline and not to penalty alternative to that prescribed by Parliament.  
     
      
       
      
    7    Counsel for the appellant noted that a guideline promulgated was that, where there was a plea of guilty, a custodial sentence of less than two years in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm should be exceptional. It should be observed in passing that that figure was mentioned in the context of there being present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender but that observation also needs to be seen in the context of being relative to an offence which did itself fall into the category of the more aggravated offence legislated to which the present applicant has pleaded guilty.  
     
      
       
      
    8    One matter adverted to on behalf of the applicant should be disposed of promptly. It was pointed out that the mathematical proportion between the available maximum penalty for what might be called the basic offence and the aggravated form of the offence demonstrated that the latter represented an increase of fifty seven percent. I reject the argument that that arithmetical observation promulgates a principle or practice that the appropriate sentence dealt with in accordance with the guideline judgment in Jurisic, should be increased by no more than fifty seven percent or a figure approximate to it when an offender is dealt with for the aggravated form of the offence.  
     
      
       
      
    9    I do not accept that when the Chief Justice said in McKinney NSW CCA No 51: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""Those guidelines (referring to  
         Jurisic 
         ) would need to be proportionately increased for the aggravated version of the offence"". 
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
       he intended to establish a regime guided by arithmetical precision as distinct from one guided by the exercise of judgment.  
        
       
      
    10    The submissions advanced by the applicant's counsel led to a contention that the factors of increased intensity applicable to the applicant (principally the extremely high concentration of alcohol) were not sufficient to justify what was described as a doubling of the sentence laid down as a guideline in Jurisic. It should not be overlooked that the expression in Jurisic was ""not less than"" and it is appropriate that each case be determined upon its own facts.  
     
      
       
      
    11    The jurisdiction of this court is not provoked until error on the part of the sentencing Judge is demonstrated. For my part I am unable to detect any such error.  
     
      
       
      
    12    In the course of written submissions counsel for the applicant wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""The whole of the circumstances of what took place on 25 June 1997 must be looked at and sentencing for both counts approached on the basis of totality, as his Honour obviously did."" 
         
        
       
      
    13    I mention this submission only to record that nothing was advanced to the court concerning what has recently been said by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen, 72 ALJR 1416 concerning the approach to sentencing on multiple counts and the apparent difference between what has been the authoritative practice in New South Wales and that in other States. A reduction of the sentence imposed in the District Court would fractionalise the penalty in proportion to the prescribed maximum deemed approach by Parliament for a single offence. The existence of more than one victim is not a factor to be ignored. As I have indicated, the sentence imposed does not manifest any miscarriage in the sound exercise of judicial discretion. 
     
      
       
      
    14    I propose the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    15    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    16    GROVE J; The order of the court will therefore be as I have proposed.

    IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL No 60599/98 GROVE J CARRUTHERS AJ  WEDNESDAY 9 JUNE 1999REGINA V JOHN FREDERICK WALKERJUDGMENT: 
     
      
       
      
    1 CARRUTHERS AJ: John Frederick Walker seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Justice Blanch, the Chief Justice of the District Court, on 11 September 1998. On that occasion the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in company and was sentenced to an overall term of three years consisting of a minimum term of twenty-one months and an additional term of fifteen months. His Honour also took into account under a Form 2, one charge of driving a vehicle knowing the same to have been stolen and one count of entering a vehicle by opening an unlocked door. 2 At the time of the subject offence, on 12 February 1998, the applicant was twenty five years old. He was unemployed and addicted to heroin and in breach of a community service order. However, he had not previously served a custodial sentence when he came forward for sentence by the Chief Judge. 3 The Chief Judge took a sympathetic approach. His Honour was satisfied that the applicant had ceased taking heroin. There were a number of other subjective factors which his Honour took into consideration but they had to be balanced with the serious objective circumstances relating both to the robbery in company charge and the two matters on the Form 2.4 Briefly stated, the robbery in company matters involved the applicant acting as the car driver for two robbers whom he knew had each armed themselves with wrenches. They robbed a store keeper of $350 and the applicant received $80 as his reward for participating in the venture. 5 The applicant has been unable to demonstrate to this court that, in imposing the sentence which he did, the Chief Judge had erred either as to the fixing of the minimum term, the additional term or the relationship between them. 6 The problem which has arisen is that the applicant is the father of five young children; one of them, unhappily, has two holes in the heart. Not surprisingly, with his incarceration, the children and his de facto wife are suffering considerable hardship. Unfortunately this is a story one hears so often in the criminal jurisdiction but, in any event, the applicant asks that the minimum term be reduced and the additional term appropriately increased so that he can get back into the community to attend to his significant family responsibilities and undertake a trade course to enhance his employability. 7 However, this court would (sympathetic as it may be to the plight of the applicant, his children and his common law partner) be failing in its responsibilities to the community at large if it were to accede to this application. Indeed, I agree completely with the submission on behalf of the Crown that if the Chief Judge erred it was not on the side of severity but on the side of leniency. Indeed, I also agree with the Crown submission that it was fortunate that the applicant was sentenced before the guidelines approach to armed robbery was adopted by this Court. 8 It is my view therefore that no sentencing error has been demonstrated. In all respects this sentence was well within the discretion available to the Chief Judge. 9 I would propose in the circumstances that the application for leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.10 GROVE J: I agree. The orders of the court will be as proposed by Mr Justice Carruthers.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONSPERLING JWednesday, 9 June 1999700217/98 - Regina v Hassan KalacheJUDGMENTHIS HONOUR:1 On 7 May 1997 I directed the jury to acquit the accused Mr Kalache. These are my reasons.2 The threshold required for such a direction is stated as follows: In Doney (1990-91) 171 CLR 207, 212: “There is no doubt that it is a trial judge’s duty to direct such a verdict if the evidence cannot sustain a guilty verdict or, as is commonly said, if there is no evidence upon which a jury could convict.”3 The Crown case is to be taken at its highest: R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74, 81; Doney at 213.4 The case against Mr Kalache, as outlined in submissions, was one of “straightforward joint criminal enterprise” or “common purpose” as those expressions are used in the authorities, there being no evidence that it was Mr Kalache who stabbed the deceased. 5 In Tangye (1997) 92 A Crim R 545, Hunt CJ at CL (with whom McInerney and Sully JJ agreed) said (at 556-558): “The Crown needs to rely upon a straightforward joint criminal enterprise only where - as in the present case - it cannot establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the person who physically committed the offence charged. It needs to rely upon the extended concept of joint criminal enterprise, based upon common purpose, only where the offence charged is not the same as the enterprise agreed. This Court has been making that point for years, See, for example:  Regina v Stokes & Difford (1950) 51 A Crim R 25 at 35-37; Regina v Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396 at 400. 
     
      
       
         
       …. 
        
          
        The law is that, where two or more persons carry out a joint criminal enterprise, each is responsible for the acts of the other or others in carrying out that enterprise. The Crown must establish both the existence of that joint criminal enterprise and the participation in it by the accused. 
        
         
       …. 
        
          
        A joint criminal enterprise exists where two or more persons reach an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between them that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express, and its existence may be inferred from all the circumstances. It need not have been reached at any time before the crime is committed. The circumstances in which two or more persons are participating together in the commission of a particular crime may themselves establish an unspoken understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement formed between them then and there to commit that crime. 
        
         
       …. 
        
         A person participates in that joint criminal enterprise either by committing the agreed crime itself or simply by being present at the time when the crime is committed, and (with knowledge that the crime is to be or is being committed) by intentionally assisting or encouraging another participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit that crime. The presence of that person at the time when the crime is committed and a readiness to give aid if required is sufficient to amount to an encouragement to the other participant in the joint criminal enterprise to commit the crime. 
        
         
       …. 
        
          
        As I have said, common purpose becomes necessary only where there has been an agreement to carry out a particular crime (some text books call it the foundational crime) but some other crime has been committed which had been within the contemplation of the accused as a possible incidence in the execution of their agreed joint criminal enterprise (some text books call it the incidental crime) which is said to be within the scope of the common purpose:  
         Johns v The Queen 
         (1980) 143 CLR 108 at 130-131;  
        Mills v The Queen 
         (1986) 68 ALR 455 at 455;  
        McAuliffe v The Queen 
         (1995) 183 CLR 108, 113-116. 
        
       
      
    6 The test is subjective:  McAuliffe, at 114-5.7 “Straightforward joint criminal enterprise” requires an agreement to do some act or acts constituting murder or manslaughter. “Common purpose” requires agreement to commit a “foundational crime”, the “incidental crime” being the crime charged, that is, murder or the statutory alternative of manslaughter.8 The evidence at its highest - according to the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions - was as follows: 
     
      
       
       (a) Mr Kalache arrived at the General Bourke Hotel with others, including Mr Sleiman. 
        
       (b) Mr Kalache, with another member of the group, was directly involved in an altercation with the deceased in the toilets. 
        
       (c) Mr Kalache was present in the group when Mr Sleiman became involved in an altercation with the deceased. 
        
       (d) Mr Kalache approached the deceased and induced the deceased to leave the hotel with him. 
        
       (e) Mr Kalache and the deceased were followed by other members of the group, including Mr Sleiman. 
        
       (f) Mr Kalache and the deceased walked onto the grassed area in front of the hotel, followed by others in the group. 
        
       (g) An incident then occurred which involved the deceased and others moving over an area on both sides of two trees located in the grassed area. 
        
       (h) The deceased was, at some stage during the incident, pushed on the shoulder by Mr Kalache, assaulted by one or more of the group (causing contusion and abrasion injuries to the face, head and hands), and was fatally stabbed in the chest and upper abdomen. 
        
       (i) Shortly after the incident, the deceased was asked who did it. He replied that it was Mr Kalache. This was not relied upon by the Crown as evidence that Mr Kalache stabbed the deceased. (That concession by the Crown - if it be a concession - was rational, proper and appropriate. I do not believe the Crown had the alternative open to it as a practical matter.) The Crown relied on the deceased’s statement as evidence that Mr Kalalche was present and participated in the assault on the deceased to a significant degree. 
        
       (j) Immediately following the incident, Mr Kalache picked up the knife which had fallen to the ground. 
        
       (k) Mr Sleiman and Mr Kalache ran from the immediate scene. 
        
       (l) Mr Sleiman and Mr Kalache (with another or others) entered Mr Sleiman’s motor vehicle, which was parked in the street nearby, and drove off. 
        
       (m) When interviewed by the police, Mr Kalache said, untruthfully, that he was not there at the time and did not know that Mr Sleiman was there. 
       
      
    9 Counsel for Mr Kalache submitted that there was no evidence of some of these factual matters. I assumed, without deciding that there was.10 On those facts, there was no evidence of agreement (express or implied) between Mr Kalache and any other or others to injure the deceased with the specific intent required to constitute murder or by an unlawful and dangerous act so as to constitute manslaughter. Therefore, there is no evidence of “straightforward joint criminal enterprise”.11 As to “common purpose”, I assumed, without deciding, that there was evidence of agreement to commit a “foundational crime”, namely assault. However, there was no evidence that Mr Kalache contemplated, as a possible incidence in the execution of the enterprise to commit that crime, that the crime of murder or manslaughter might be committed by one or more of the group in the way that occurred or in any cognate manner.12 There was no evidence that Mr Kalache knew that anyone in the group had a knife. There was no evidence that Mr Kalache would have contemplated that a knife might be produced and used.13 Adopting the language used in Anderson and Morris (1966) 2 QB 110, 120, “one of (the adventurers) has departed completely from the concerted action of the common design and has suddenly formed an intent to kill and has used a weapon and acted in a way which no party to that common design could suspect”. Adopting the language used in Duong, Lu Do & Tran (1992) 61 A Crim R 140, 148, “the use of the knife ….was entirely outside the scope of what could be expected to occur …”.

     Geoffrey Brian Toomey v Western Aboriginal Legal Service Ltd 
      
       
    Reasons for judgment1 At the outset of this judgment I should record that I informed counsel for the parties of my association, as employed solicitor and as counsel, with the original Aboriginal Legal Service throughout the 1970s and of the fact that, in more recent years, I was briefed as counsel on at least one occasion by a solicitor employed by the defendant. (That solicitor is not the person said to have furnished the advice giving rise to these proceedings, with whom I have had no contact.) I was informed that neither party objected to my hearing the matter, at least for the limited purpose for which it was listed before me. 2 On 12 January 1981 the plaintiff suffered spinal injuries when he dived into the Macquarie River near Wellington, striking his head on submerged rocks. As a result he is a quadriplegic. He alleges that his injuries were the result of the negligence of a number of statutory authorities for reasons which, for present purposes, I need not examine. He further alleges that in early 1985 he consulted a solicitor employed by the defendant, who advised him that he had no basis for an action for damages for negligence against anyone. 3 In December 1994 the plaintiff sought advice from other solicitors, who considered that he may have a cause of action. In November 1995 they lodged an application on his behalf to extend the limitation period for that purpose. On 8 December 1995 Master Greenwood granted the application, so as to enable proceedings to be commenced against the statutory authorities to which I have referred. However, those authorities appealed against the Master’s decision and that appeal was allowed by Ireland J on 21 February 1997.4 As a result, the plaintiff has instituted the present proceedings for damages against the defendant, alleging that the original advice that he had no claim arising out of the accident was negligent. The grounds of defence assert that this claim also is statute barred. As I have said, the accident occurred on 12 January 1981 and, as the law then stood, the limitation period for any action arising from it expired on 12 January 1987. It is the defendant’s case that any cause of action against it for negligent advice accrued on the following day, 13 January 1987, so that that action itself became statute barred on 13 January 1993. The current proceedings were not commenced until July 1997. 5 The only question I am asked to decide is whether this defence under the Limitation Act 1969 is made out. For this purpose I shall assume that the plaintiff had a good cause of action against one or more of the statutory authorities arising from the accident and that he was negligently advised by a solicitor employed by the defendant, although the defendant concedes neither of those things. 6 The limitation period for bringing an action against the defendant was six years after the cause of action first accrued: s14(1)(b) of the Limitation Act. The critical question is when that course of action accrued. It is not possible to extend the six year period. The only provision for extension of a limitation period is in Part 3, Division 3, which relates only to actions for damages for personal injury. It was those provisions which were relied upon in the application before Master Greenwood and the appeal to Ireland J relating to the original cause of action. The present action is for economic loss arising from the loss of an opportunity to pursue a claim for personal injury: Nikolaou v Papasavas, Phillips & Co (1989) 166 CLR 394 at 402-3.7 A cause of action in negligence accrues when damage first occurs: Hawkins v Clayton (1988) 164 CLR 539 per Brennan J (as he then was) at 561, Deane J at 587 and Gaudron J at 599 ff. As Gaudron J observed (at 601), to determine when damage first occurs in actions for economic loss it is necessary to identify precisely the interest said to have been infringed. Her Honour’s approach was adopted by other members of the Court in Wardley Australia Ltd v The State of Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514, in the joint judgment at 527 and per Toohey J at 555-6. The Court has rejected any “general overriding qualification” to the effect that a limitation period does not begin to run “until the stage is reached when the plaintiff discovers, or could on reasonable inquiry have discovered, that the loss has been sustained”: Wardley per Deane J at 540.8 Nikolaou and the case which the High Court heard immediately before it, Johnson v Perez (1988-89) 166 CLR 351, were concerned primarily with how damages in actions for professional negligence of this kind should be assessed. It is clear from the judgments in both cases that their Honours considered the plaintiff’s loss to have occurred when he was deprived of his opportunity to pursue his claim for damages in the original action. In Johnson v Perez that opportunity was lost when the action was dismissed for want of prosecution. In Nikolaou, as in this case, it was when the action became statute-barred. In the latter case, in the joint judgment at 404, their Honours said: For reasons which are set out in some detail in Johnson v Perez, his Honour should have first focussed on Mr Nikolaou’s situation when his claim for damages for personal injuries became statute-barred. He should have assessed damages by reference to the loss at that date of the right to claim damages.9 The same view had earlier been taken in Doundoulakis v Antony Sdrinis & Co [1989] VR 781, in which it was held that a cause of action against a solicitor for negligently failing to institute proceedings within a limitation period is complete when that period expires. Ormiston J, who gave the leading judgment, referred to the familiar distinction between barring the remedy and barring the right, the right to sue being lost only if the limitation period is pleaded in defence. His Honour said (at 785):  It is the barring of the remedy which is critical in a case such as the present, corresponding as it does to the immunity which the defendant then acquires, albeit it is an immunity he may not choose to assert. Howsoever one characterises this conditional immunity and this conditional barring of the plaintiff’s remedy, the plaintiff is left with a remedy very different in quality from that which he had before the limitation period expired.10 In that case, the appellant had wished to bring proceedings for personal injury against his employer but claimed that his solicitors had failed to commence the proceedings within time. Ormiston J found that he had “suffered measurable damage the moment the limitation period had expired, in that his remedy had been substantially impaired”. His Honour continued (at 786): The appellant’s argument confused two matters, one, the loss of the right of action against the employer and, two, the harm suffered by the plaintiff when the limitation period for that cause of action was allowed to expire. There is no dispute that the right of action was not completely extinguished until either the defence was delivered or judgment in reliance upon that defence was entered for the defendant employer. Nevertheless, damage in the relevant sense does not necessarily require loss of a right, only that the right and the related remedy should have been impaired to some measurable or significant degree.11 His Honour concluded (at 787) that the appellant’s remedy in the original action was lost “when his unfettered right to sue his employer became statute-barred, subject only to the employer choosing not to rely upon its rights”. It was then the damage was suffered and the cause of action against the solicitors was complete. 12 For present purposes it is unnecessary to consider s63(1) of the Limitation Act, the effect of which is that a cause of action in tort is extinguished upon the expiration of the relevant limitation period. In particular, it is unnecessary to enter into the debate whether the plaintiff’s original cause of action was extinguished upon expiration of the limitation period, subject to the possibility of revival in the event of a successful application for extension under Part 3, Division 3, or whether it was extinguished only when an extension was refused by the judgment of Ireland J referred to earlier: Commonwealth v Dixon (1988) 13 NSWLR 601 per Hope JA at 609-10; Commonwealth v Mewett (1997) 191 CLR 471 per Dawson J at 507-10, Toohey J at 515-7 and McHugh J at 522-3. 13 Provision in the Act for an application for extension does not alter the fact that, when the limitation period expired, the plaintiff’s remedy was “impaired to some measurable or significant degree”: Doundoulakis (supra). In Mewett, Dawson J was of the view that s14(1) of the Act bars the remedy but does not extinguish “the underlying cause of action” (at 509). He considered that extinguishment under s63(1) occurred only when an application for extension of time had been refused or the opportunity to make it had passed. Albeit in a different context, some of his Honour’s observations (also at 509) are relevant for present purposes:  Thus s14(1) does not of itself prevent a statute-barred cause of action from continuing in existence. Of course, the value of the property comprising the cause of action would be affected by the fact that the action was statute-barred and would further be affected by such factors as the likelihood of the limitation defence being pleaded or the likelihood of the limitation period being extended.14 Accordingly, the plaintiff’s cause of action against the defendant first accrued when his original action became statute-barred. It was then that the limitation period in which to bring the present action began to run, pursuant to section 14(1). 15 Counsel for the plaintiff referred to a passage in the judgment of Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton (at 590), in which his Honour considered that “the reference in s14(1) of the Act to the cause of action first accruing should be construed as excluding any period during which the wrongful act itself effectively precluded the institution of the proceedings”. In that context, his Honour referred to the equitable notion that it would be unconscionable to permit reliance upon a limitation provision where a cause of action had been concealed until after the relevant period had expired: see now s55 of the Act. It would be unconscionable for the defendant to rely upon the limitation period in the present case, it was said, because the plaintiff’s predicament is entirely the result of the negligent advice he was given by the defendant’s employed solicitor in 1985. 16 In Hawkins v Clayton the behaviour of the solicitors was such that the appellant was unaware for some years of the facts upon which an action against them might have been brought. That is not this case. At any time after receiving the solicitor’s advice in 1985, the plaintiff could have sought another legal opinion, as he finally did in December 1994. The distinction between Hawkins v Clayton and a case such as the present was drawn in Sampson v Zucker (Court of Appeal, unreported 11 December 1996) per Gleeson CJ at p4ff. In any event, as the Chief Justice observed, the view of Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton was not applied by the other justices of the High Court in that case.17 The decision of Master Harrison in Grew v Walsh (unreported, 16 October 1997), upon which counsel for the plaintiff also relied, takes the matter no further. That was an application by the defendant solicitor that the plaintiff’s action be summarily dismissed or struck out because it was statute-barred. The Master refused the application only because the plaintiff, in a reply to the defence, alleged that the defendant had fraudulently concealed the plaintiff’s entitlement to bring an action against him for a significant period of time (s55). The Master concluded that he had an arguable case that there was a period of concealment. No such allegation has been made in the present case.18 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the defence based upon the Limitation Act is made out. I shall consult counsel about the orders which should be made and, if necessary, hear argument on costs.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
        
        
       
      
    1    GROVE J : This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence imposed by Morgan DCJ in the District Court at Parramatta on 9 October 1998. 
     
      
       
      
    2    The particular offence was breaking entering and stealing which carries a prescribed maximum penalty of 14 years penal servitude. Her Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of two years penal servitude which in his favour she divided into minimum and additional terms of 12 months each respectively. 
     
      
       
      
    3    The applicant had at the time of sentence been in custody in respect of other matters dating back to mid 1998. The reason for this is that the applicant was certainly not without prior conviction. He had many of these and the schedule attached to particulars at trial shows no less than 25 entries, many of which are for multiple offences. Nevertheless the applicant pleaded guilty to this offence and he deserves some credit for that but it cannot be a matter of great weight given the circumstances of his being captured virtually red handed. This will emerge from the brief sketch of the facts which I will mention now. 
     
      
       
      
    4    The applicant was one of a group of four offenders who drove a vehicle through the front doors of a business at Chatswood. What was conducted is what is sometimes referred to as a ram raid. The vehicle breached the security of the building and some lap top computers were stolen. However a patrolling security guard informed police and radio messages were broadcast as a result of which the offenders were stopped by police and eventually detained and arrested. 
     
      
       
      
    5    It might be noted in passing that the applicant gave a false name and address to police upon his arrest but his true identity was discovered as a result of a fingerprint check. 
     
      
       
      
    6    One matter to which the applicant has adverted is the fashion in which a co-offender was dealt with. That co-offender in particular was David Zdravokovic who appeared at the Hornsby Local Court where he received a total sentence of 18 months penal servitude divided into 14 months minimum term and four months additional term. It might be observed that that sentence is less in total than that received by the applicant but the minimum term element of it is longer. 
     
      
       
      
    7    With the assistance of the Crown Prosecutor, some summary can be given of the submissions advanced by the applicant in his written response to the Registrar's direction. I have noted that the applicant appears for himself in this application. 
     
      
       
      
    8    He proposes the following matters: First, that his offence could have been dealt with earlier and as he was in custody for other matters, he feels that he may have discharged some of his obligation to serve sentence concurrently. Alternatively, he has submitted today that even if the sentence were accumulated, he feels that he would be presently at liberty. Next he contended that he was taken to court without notice and the judge would not grant him an adjournment, thus he had no time to arrange a parole report, a psychological report or a solicitor. 
     
      
       
      
    9    It is difficult to fully comprehend what is behind this submission. The record shows that the applicant was represent by a solicitor. A parole report as such was not tendered to her Honour but a parole officer gave oral evidence. There is a view that the oral evidence may have been more beneficial to the applicant, or indeed any offender, rather than the bare written report which frequently has to be the resource from which a sentencing judge must reach conclusions. 
     
      
       
      
    10    The reference to a psychological report gains some significance in the circumstance that we have provisionally received a report from Mr W John Taylor dated 27 April 1998 concerning the applicant. That report was apparently prepared in anticipation of other matters for which the applicant was at the time standing for sentence. By reason of its date, it is apparent that the report ought to have been available, if the applicant wished, before the sentencing judge. 
     
      
       
      
    11    In any event, there was reference made in the evidence of the probation officer to the existence of a psychological report. One of the significant matters upon which the applicant wishes to rely is that he was suffering from grief arising out of the felonious death of one of his brothers, that death apparently being caused by yet another brother. There is nothing in this material which in my view would give rise to intervention by this Court. 
     
      
       
      
    12    The applicant said in his written submissions that he wished to be reunited with his family and he has reiterated his wish for that today and, in effect, his undertaking to stay out of trouble if given a chance. 
     
      
       
      
    13    Dealing with these matters beyond the comments that I have already made, it is apparent that there can be no justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the different ways in which the applicant and his co-offender Zdravokovic was treated. The circumstances were different and her Honour was alert to what had happened at Hornsby Local Court and she made express reference to it in her remarks on sentence. Her remarks disclose no error of approach or assessment. 
     
      
       
      
    14    The reference to application for an adjournment is obscure in the context that it appears only in the applicant's present submissions. The record of proceedings show that no such application was made on the occasion that the applicant appeared in the District Court at Parramatta. 
     
      
       
      
    15    The final matter to which I should make reference is the assertion by the applicant that he would be out of custody by now if he had served some of the sentence concurrently with others, or even if the sentence had been cumulated. It is impossible to perceive any validity in those contentions in the sense that what her Honour might have done is a matter of entire speculation. There is no entitlement of any prisoner, including the applicant, to serve any particular sentences concurrently. On each occasion a sentencing judge has to exercise discretion in accordance with the merits of the case, the guidelines of appellate courts and the requisite strictures of statutes regarding multiple and cumulative sentences. There is apparently no error made by her Honour in respect of the present matter. 
     
      
       
      
    16    As was pointed out to the applicant, this is a court of error, that is to say its jurisdiction is not invoked unless it can be shown that there was some mistake made in the court below. In my view the sentence reached by her Honour manifests no error of approach or assessment. The imposition is well within the range of the sound exercise of judicial discretion. Indeed, it could be said, as the Crown Prosecutor commented in his written submissions, that if anything it falls within the lenient sector of any range. 
     
      
       
      
    17    I would grant leave to appeal but the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    18    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    19    GROVE J: The order of the Court therefore is the application for leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed. I will return that copy of the psychological report to the applicant to keep with his papers.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL 60801/98  GROVE J CARRUTHERS AJ  FRIDAY 11 JUNE 1999 JAMES LAWRENCE SHEPHERD v REGINA (NSW) JUDGMENT 
     
      
       
      
    1 CARRUTHERS AJ: James Lawrence Shepherd seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by Judge Viney QC at the District Court Sydney on 16 September 1998.2 The applicant had pleaded guilty to one count of supply prohibited drug (cannabis). See section 25(1) and section 32(1)(h) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1995 which offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment or $200,000 fine or both.3 His Honour sentenced the applicant to a minimum term of nine months imprisonment to commence on 16 November 1998 and to expire on 15 September 1999 and imposed an additional term of 12 months to commence on 16 September 1999 and to expire on 15 September 2000. His Honour said that he had taken into account in the sentence that the applicant spent 10 days in pre-sentence custody. In fact it would appear that the precise period of pre-sentence custody was 8 days.4 It was accepted by the Crown that in view of the quantity of cannabis involved this matter could have been finalised in the Local Court in which case the maximum custodial penalty would have been two years imprisonment. 5 It is relevant to notice in this regard Part 9A: “Summary Disposal of Indictable Offences by Local Courts” in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. This offence is to be dealt with summarily by the Local Court unless the prosecuting authority elects in accordance with Part 9A, to have the offence dealt with on indictment. Thus it is different to some other provisions which provide that an offence may be dealt summarily within the Local Court on the election of the prosecuting authority. The stress here is that primarily the matter is a Local Court matter unless there is an affirmative election by the prosecuting authority that the matter proceed in the District Court where there is of course a much greater maximum penalty.6 There was some discussion about the subject matter being in the District Court and precisely how it got there. Be that as it may, it is common ground that the matter was lawfully in the District Court and the maximum penal sentence was 10 years. I shall briefly return to this aspect of the case. 7 The relevant facts may be briefly stated. The applicant was born on 23 February 1973. At the time of the subject offence, he was living in Adelaide, South Australia, separated from his wife and two young children who also lived in Adelaide. He was employed as a ceiling fixer but at the time of the subject offence was on compensation and therefore receiving a reduced income which was, it appears, imposing financial pressures upon him.8 Sometime before 25 June 1998, the date of the subject offence, the applicant told a man, to whom I shall refer as Harry, in Adelaide, whom he knew to be a dealer in cannabis, that the applicant knew a man in Sydney, to whom I shall refer as Todd, who could sell cannabis. Very shortly then before 25 June 1998, Harry asked the applicant would he introduce the man, to whom I shall refer as Ray, to Todd in Sydney for the purpose of the sale of cannabis.9 Ray was to drive from Adelaide to Sydney and bring a box of cannabis with him. Harry arranged with the applicant that he, the applicant, would travel to Sydney and make contact with Todd and Ray and that he would introduce them to each other. Ray would then hand the box of cannabis over to Todd. Harry gave the applicant $1,000 to cover his airfare and accommodation in Sydney. However, the applicant said that he believed that he was to get something more out of the deal for himself but no arrangements were made as to quantum. As the applicant said in evidence to Judge Viney, bearing in mind his financial position, anything which he got out of the deal was ""a bonus"". So pursuant to this arrangement the applicant flew to Sydney and was picked up at the airport by Todd who drove him to the Novotel Hotel. They were expecting Ray to arrive but in fact he did not and Todd could wait no longer and for some reason or other he had to leave the hotel.10 Ray ultimately arrived at the hotel with the box, having travelled from Adelaide, but when he arrived Todd had gone and only the applicant was there. Thus the prearranged plan had not gone as intended.11 Now, although it was part of the arrangement, according to the applicant, that he was not to touch the box, by reason of the circumstances which had arisen, the applicant decided that he would take the box to Todd's home at Chifley on the following morning. This he did. He left the Novotel Hotel and travelled to Todd's home at Chifley with the box but unfortunately for the applicant, Todd's home was under surveillance by Federal Agents, and both Todd and the applicant were arrested. It would seem that the whole arrangement had been monitored by Federal Agents.12 The applicant had a strong subjective case. By the time of the sentencing proceedings he was reunited with his wife and children and was in full employment. Mrs Shepherd gave evidence at the sentence proceedings in which she said that her husband had been naive and too trusting but the experience through which he had been had made him more mature.13 A pre-sentence report indicated that the offence was committed at a time when the applicant was emotionally unstable. He had the advantage of no prior criminal record.14 There was a strong subjective case.15 Judge Viney accepted that the applicant's role was not that of a principal but more in the nature of a domestic carrier or go-between. His Honour referred however to the well established principle that it is only in exceptional circumstances that departure from a full-time custodial sentence could be justified with regard to offences of this nature. He referred to the applicant not being addicted to drugs, having been co-operative with the police and the early plea of guilty. His Honour noted that the amount of cannabis involved was said to be worth between $25,000 and $30,000 street value.16 However, his Honour felt that balancing the objective and the subjective circumstances and the proper application of the law, a custodial sentence was, in effect, inevitable.17 A significant aspect of the appeal is that no reference seems to have been made by counsel to his Honour to the fact that the matter would have been dealt with by the Local Court if the prosecuting authority had not deemed it appropriate to have the matter dealt with in the District Court. Reference has been made to Dalton - Morgan, (CCA, unreported 14 December 1989) and Jason Clyde Smith, (CCA, unreported 11 September 1991).18 In the latter case, Priestly JA, who gave the judgment of the Court, said:  
     
      
       
        
         
         “The case that was brought was one that could have been dealt with under section 30 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Under that section the penalty is a fine of 50 penalty units or imprisonment for a term of two years or both. This is a factor which was apparently not drawn to the sentencing judge's attention. It is one that this Court has decided can be taken into account in a case such as the present”.  
         
        
       
       
      
    19 His Honour then cited Dalton - Morgan and continued:  
     
      
       
        
         
         ""It would also, of course, have been open to the magistrate, to take into account in considering the appropriate penalty the surrounding circumstances of the matter, including the discovery of the large quantity of the cannabis leaf at the applicant's home, assuming again, of course, that those surrounding circumstances provided evidence linking the applicant with the other cannabis leaf, even if the linkage fell short of a case of possession."" 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         ""In my view the position concerning the availability of the summary method of dealing with the matter under s 30 was an important factor for consideration in the sentencing of the applicant. The fact that it was not taken into account so far as any of the materials in this Court show led to what I think was an excessive sentence and one which in my opinion should be set aside"". 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 It is relevant to note that in Smith, the case which the Crown actually proved at the trial was that the applicant had gone to Redfern where he took steps enabling his brother to sell two to three grams of cannabis leaf for a price of approximately $50. 21 There is no doubt in the present case in my view, that if his Honour's attention been drawn to the fact that the matter would have been dealt with in the Local Court had the prosecuting authority not elected otherwise, was a relevant matter for consideration. Nevertheless, it seems to me that it was a perfectly proper and responsible exercise of the discretion which was vested in the prosecuting authority to bring the subject matter in the District Court.22 It can be seen that the illegal transaction which I have briefly set out above was one that involved some days for its consummation. It involved the applicant travelling from Adelaide to Sydney and ultimately, his handing over the subject drug to the proposed seller in Sydney. And one must also take into consideration that it was the applicant who identified to Harry, Todd as a person in Sydney who could sell cannabis.23 One is constantly referred in cases such as this to the judgment of Wells J of the Supreme Court of Australia in Le Cerf (1975-6) 8 ALR 349 at 351 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""If there were no middle men and underlings, there would be no top men in an organisation. If an organisation is starved of recruits, it must collapse."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    24 Even allowing for the fact that no reference was made to the possibility of this matter having been dealt with in the Local Court, I am quite unable to conclude that the sentence, both by way of the minimum term and the additional term, was outside the sentencing discretion of his Honour in the particular circumstances of this case. Accordingly, in my view, although leave to appeal should be granted, I consider that the appeal should be dismissed.25 GROVE J: I agree with Mr Justice Carruthers. The orders of the Court will be as he has proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
      
      
     1     
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by his Honour Judge O'Reilly in the Liverpool District Court on 10 December 1998. 
      
       
      
     2     
     On that occasion the applicant was required to appear for sentence having been committed pursuant to section 51A of the Justices Act upon two counts of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death. The maximum prescribed penalty for each of those offences was 14 years imprisonment. This Court will come to the question of resentence of the applicant and I can briefly express reasons why that is so. 
      
       
      
     3     
     At the hearing in Liverpool District Court, his Honour was informed that the applicable speed limit at the site of the accident was 60 kilometres per hour. In his remarks on sentence his Honour made it clear that he regarded it as a significant factor that not only was the applicant driving whilst there was in his blood a considerable concentration of alcohol and that he passed through a red traffic control signal but also that in so doing he was driving at something in the vicinity of 80 to 85 kilometres per hour in an area where the prescribed limit was 20 to 25 kilometres per hour less. It is conceded by the Crown that the information given to his Honour was incorrect and that the prescribed speed limit was 80 kilometres per hour. 
      
       
      
     4     
     That misinformation led to the occurrence of error not on the part of the sentencing judge but in relation to the material upon which he relied. Therefore, as I have indicated, this Court should regard its jurisdiction as invoked. 
      
       
      
     5     
     His Honour dealt with the applicant by sentencing him to a total term of nine years imprisonment concurrent on each of the charges which he divided into minimum and additional terms of six years and nine month and two years and three months respectively. There is no doubt that that was a severe sentence. 
      
       
      
     6     
     Since the decision of this Court in  
     R v Jurisic 
      1998 101 A Crim R 259 it is clear that it is the duty of sentencing judges to recognize an upward trend from what had emerged as a pattern of lenient sentences for offences of this nature. 
      
       
      
     7     
     Jurisic 
      was in its terms what is described as a guideline judgment but it should be noted that  
     Jurisic 
      dealt with an offence under this section of the Crimes Act relating to what might be described as the basic offence. The legislature has also prescribed a more aggravated form of the offence which is available when the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the offender exceeds 0.15 per cent. In the current case the concentration in the blood of the applicant was 0.219 per cent. That is a considerable excess over the threshold and it is, of course, a considerable multiple of the concentration above which it is an offence to drive a motor vehicle on a public street at all. 
      
       
      
     8     
     I have already mentioned that the accident occurred when the applicant drove his vehicle contrary to traffic control signals. The two persons who were killed were women aged 26 and 80 respectively. 
      
       
      
     9     
     It has been observed that this offence involves not only the dangerous driving but its essence is that it is coupled with the consequence of causing death. In this case two deaths were caused and the offences are the more serious because of that multiplicity. 
      
       
      
     10     
     It has been pointed that out that statistics derived from records kept by the Judicial Commission indicate that this sentence is at the very top of those recorded instances. Nevertheless, as the Crown Prosecutor has observed, much of the source material must relate to penalties imposed prior to October last year when the decision in  
     Jurisic 
      was given. As I have indicated, the result of  
     Jurisic 
      is that an upward trend from previous sentencing levels can be observed. 
      
       
      
     11     
     I do not propose to refer to the numerous cases that senior counsel for the applicant and the Crown Prosecutor have accumulated for the guidance of this Court but I do propose to refer to  
     McDonald 
     , CCA unreported 12 October 1998 in which this Court handed down judgment coincidentally on the same day as  
     Jurisic 
     . That was a case where the offender had a blood alcohol level of 0.195 per cent. It was a Crown appeal and the court substituted a total sentence of six years for a sentence of five years which had been imposed in the court below. The restraint which is exercised in reimposing sentence after a successful Crown appeal does not require elaboration. 
      
       
      
     12     
     The offender  
     McDonald 
      had caused grievous bodily harm to one victim and death to another. Mr Hastings QC for the applicant has pointed out that  
     McDonald 
      had on his record a prior offence of driving whilst there was present in his blood the prescribed concentration of intoxicating liquor. Therefore, he contends, there is a distinction between the case of  
     McDonald  
     and the present. Obviously what he states is correct. 
      
       
      
     13     
     All cases are different but in seeking comparisons one could say that between the present appeal and  
     McDonald 
     , there is on the one hand that prior conviction of  
     McDonald 
      whereas in this case there has been the death of two people as distinguished from the death of one in the case of  
     McDonald 
     . 
      
       
      
     14     
     The learned sentencing judge took into account matters in the applicant's favour including the absence of significant prior conviction although he did have matters of exceeding the speed limit on his record. He found that there was remorse and contrition and, of course, his pleas of guilty at the earliest possible opportunity needed to be given weight. 
      
       
      
     15     
     The applicant is in a situation that his current remaining in Australia has been the subject of litigation in another jurisdiction. It appears clear that upon release from custody he will not be permitted to remain in this country. His Honour found that there were no special circumstances justifying departure from the formula mentioned in s5 (2) of the Sentencing Act. For myself I would come to the same conclusion. The question therefore is what is an appropriate penalty. 
      
       
      
     16     
     It was agreed that his Honour had approached this matter in terms of totality so that for each of the charges a similar but concurrently served sentence was imposed. 
      
       
      
     17     
     I am conscious of the recent remarks of the High Court in  
     The Queen v Pearce 
      1998 72 ALJR 1416 concerning the approach to be taken where there are multiple offences however, nothing has been advanced to this Court suggesting that we should adopt an approach different from that of the sentencing judge. 
      
       
      
     18     
     Accordingly, I would propose the following orders: That the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted, the appeal allowed and the sentences imposed in the District Court be quashed and in lieu thereof on each of the charges the applicant be sentenced to total terms of seven years imprisonment to be served concurrently, divided into minimum terms of five years three months, to commence on 10 December 1998 and to expire on 9 March 2004, together with additional terms of one year and nine months commencing on 10 March 2004. The applicant should be specified eligible for release on 9 March 2004. 
      
       
      
     19     
     CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. I would merely add by way of comment that there is very significant criminality involved in driving a motor vehicle whilst under the influence of alcohol to the extent that the present case demonstrates. Here the applicant was driving with something like five times the prescribed limit. It is essential, as it is now clear, that the minimum term must reflect the degree of criminality as well as the overall sentence imposed. 
      
       
      
     20     
     There is a growing trend now within the judicial system to recognise the criminality involved in driving motor vehicles whilst significantly under the influence of alcohol and to impose sentences which reflect that criminality. There were special circumstances in this case which required this Court to intervene but the reduction in the sentence that became necessary here is not, one hopes, to be considered in any way to undermine or to depart from the acknowledgment of the serious criminality that is involved in offences of this nature. 
      
       
      
     21     
     I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding judge for the reasons which he has given. 
      
       
      
     22     
     GROVE J: The orders of the Court therefore will be as I proposed.

     REGINA v ROGER BERNARD 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1    GROVE J : This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by McGuire DCJ in the Newcastle District Court. 
     
      
       
      
    2    The applicant was sentenced on 23 October 1998 in respect of two counts of passing valueless cheques and his Honour was asked to take into account one other matter of a similar nature in passing sentence. The penalty imposed was on the first count a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention and on the second count a fixed term of three months imprisonment to be served similarly by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
       
      
    3    As a matter of history, bail has not been sought pending this appeal and it is common ground that the applicant has served in full the sentence imposed upon the second count and, in respect of the first count he has reached the administrative stage two in his periodic detention, that is to say as observed by this Court in R v Hallocoglu 1992 29 NSWLR 67 he is presently discharging his obligation by way of a penalty which is in effect no more onerous than community service. 
     
      
       
      
    4    A submission was however advanced that the applicant would be benefited by a specific order for community service because he could do that without having his weekends interrupted. The reason for his desire that this not occur is that the applicant is a medical practitioner and is anxious to rehabilitate a practice which was damaged as a result of the events that led him before McGuire DCJ. 
     
      
       
      
    5    It is convenient to summarise the offences briefly. The applicant, although a medical practitioner as was his wife, according to the material before his Honour, elected to participate in some commercial ventures from which no doubt he hoped to make profit. Large amounts were involved. It suffices to observe that the attempts were unsuccessful in the sense that profits were not forthcoming and the applicant was eventually made bankrupt. 
     
      
       
      
    6    At a time when he was seeking to keep these ventures afloat he passed valueless cheques for the amounts of $186,000, $204,000 and $80,000 respectively. This was, as the Crown Prosecutor observed in written submissions, in part the culmination of an ever increasing spiral of cheques drawn and deposited between the Greater Newcastle Building Society and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The applicant was able to take advantage apparently of his status as a particularly valued customer of the bank and he was allowed to draw against cheques deposited even though they had not been cleared. 
     
      
       
      
    7    The activity of the applicant has almost ancient antecedents. It was known for many years as kite flying. This meant that persons took advantage of the clearance time between banking houses. It can be observed that in recent years with the advent of computerised records banks are capable of debiting accounts almost instantly, although it appears still to require some days for deposits to be cleared. As I have indicated, the applicant was able to engage in this conduct because of his status as a “valued” customer. That what he was doing was dishonest was self evident. 
     
      
       
      
    8    Complaint is made in this court that the learned sentencing judge gave too much weight to the question of general deterrence, it being pointed out that the maximum prescribed sentence for passing a valueless cheque is 12 months imprisonment. That was the total effective sentence passed in respect of two offences by the applicant, together with one other offence being taken into account on the schedule. I have already mentioned that the maximum sentence certainly was not imposed in any sense, even on a single count, because the collateral order enabling the sentence to be served by way of periodic detention meant that there was a strong element of lenience built into the penalty. 
     
      
       
      
    9    The applicant, so the evidence before his Honour indicated, suffered from a diagnosed medical condition generally described as a class of mental illness. He was unable to cope with the pressures of running his medical practice and the business venture upon which he was embarked. This material was before his Honour and it was taken into account. 
     
      
       
      
    10    It was complained that his Honour made reference to “fraud” whereas fraudulent behaviour was not an element of the charges against the applicant. This was said to be significant in accordance with the principles of the Queen v De Simoni 1981 147 CLR 383 because the applicant had, in fact, earlier been charged with three counts of obtaining a benefit by deception but the Crown did not proceed with those charges. His Honour in passing remarks did note that there had been apparently some agreement between the representatives of the prosecution and the applicant but he expressly said that that circumstance was no concern of his. There is no indication whatever that his Honour breached the principle in De Simoni by punishing the applicant for an offence more serious than that for which he stood for sentence. 
     
      
       
      
    11    As I have indicated, the amounts involved were significant indeed. The applicant's behaviour was in any sense dishonest. Indeed that is what I take his Honour to have been making reference when he used the word “fraud”. This application, bearing in mind the lenience already granted to the applicant, is in my view entirely without merit. I would refuse leave to appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    12    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
     
      
       
      
    13    GROVE J: The order of the Court therefore is leave to appeal is refused.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONGRAHAM BARR JFriday, 11 June 199970211/96 - REGINA v James Hepeta TARAWASENTENCE1   HIS HONOUR: The prisoner, James Hepeta Tarawa, pleaded guilty to a charge of affray contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    2   On 7 November 1997, Acting Justice Howie ordered him to perform 200 hours’ community service comprising of 150 hours of community service work and 50 hours of attendance at the Pendle Hill Attendance Centre. His Honour appointed a local court to be the supervising court. 
     
      
    3   The prisoner completed only 39 hours of the work component of the order, the last on 21 February 1998. He attended the Pendle Hill Attendance Centre for only 23 hours, the last occasion being on 4 May 1998. 
     
      
    4   On 17 November 1998 the prisoner was called up for breach of his Honour’s order. He was arrested and taken before the magistrate at the supervising court. His breach of his Honour’s order constituted an offence under s 23 of the Community Service Orders Act 1979, and the supervising court convicted him of that offence, and under the provisions under s 25(1)(c) of the Act committed the prisoner to be dealt with by this Court. The magistrate allowed him bail. 
     
      
    5   On 23 November 1998 the prisoner appeared before me unrepresented, and I adjourned the matter so that he could obtain legal advice and representation. I ordered his bail to continue. On the adjourned day, 7 December 1998, he did not appear and I stood the matter over to 10 December. He did not appear on that day and I revoked his bail and directed the issue of a warrant for his arrest. 
     
      
    6   The prisoner was arrested on 2 May 1999 and brought before the Court on 14 May 1999. On 14 May 1999 I adjourned the matter until today and at the request of his counsel, Mr Hoenig, requested the provision of a pre-sentence report dealing with the suitability of the prisoner to serve a community service order. 
     
      
    7   Under s 25(4) of the Act, the powers of this Court are that 
     
      
       
        
        (a) without prejudice to the continuation in force of the order, impose on the person a fine not exceeding 2.5 penalty units; 
         
        (b) deal with the person, for the offence in respect of which the order was made, in any manner in which the person could have been dealt with for that offence by that court if it had not made the order and, unless the order has ceased to be in force, revoke the order; or 
         
        (c) take no action. 
        
       
      
    8   By s 26, if this Court imposes a sentence for the offence in respect of which the community service order was made, it must take into account the fact that the order was made and anything done under the order. 
     
      
    9   The prisoner’s breach of the order was so serious that I consider it inappropriate for the Court to take no action. His attention to his obligations under the order was sporadic. Ten letters had to be sent to him over the period from November 1997 to May 1998, accompanied by a number of oral warnings by staff of the attendance centre. 
     
      
    10   The prisoner said to the author of the pre-sentence report that he failed to complete his obligations under the order because of his separation from his de facto wife and a subsequent period of instability in his living circumstances. However, he was unable to explain to the author why he lost contact with the Probation and Parole Service and why he failed to discuss these matters with his community service officer or his community service attendance co-ordinator. 
     
      
    11   Evidence has been given this morning by the prisoner and by his de facto wife, Miss Saliba, which shows that during the three month period beginning some weeks before Christmas 1998 and ending in February or March this year, the prisoner was absent from his home, and I accept that the effect of the stresses of life upon him at that time were such that he could not give adequate attention to the ordinary obligations of life, let alone the special obligations imposed by the order of his Honour. 
     
      
    12   The charge of affray for which the prisoner was sentenced by his Honour arose out of a serious brawl which occurred between him and friends of his, and a larger group of young Aboriginal men outside the service station in suburban Sydney. The brawl led on to a second more serious incident between the same groups. In that incident one man died and another was very badly hurt, but as his Honour made clear, the prisoner was not to be sentenced for anything that happened in the second incident. The affray with which his Honour was concerned occurred when the prisoner and his friends went to a garage to buy cigarettes. The prisoner waited in the car and two of his friends went inside. Aboriginal young men were there and an altercation took place and an assault. The prisoner was not a party to that incident. All he saw was the continuation of the altercation and the assault when the parties to it came outside the service station to the place where the prisoner was. When he realised that there was trouble between the two groups, the prisoner got out of the car and joined his friends. 
     
      
    13   His Honour found that the prisoner was the first person to use actual physical violence outside the service station. Shortly after he had struck one of the Aboriginals, a brawl arose which gave rise to the charge of affray. The prisoner and about four of his colleagues were outnumbered by members of the opposing group. During the brawl, the fighting became heavier because weapons like sticks and a garbage can came to be used. During the brawl the prisoner went into the service station and asked for something to arm himself with. He was denied such assistance, so he left the service station, found himself a piece of wood, and returned to the fray. He and his colleagues were overwhelmed and he suffered minor injuries. That was the end of the affray, so far as concerned the criminal responsibility of the prisoner. 
     
      
    14   His Honour observed that as a general rule, a person coming before the Court convicted of conduct of this kind, might expect to receive a full time gaol sentence. However, his Honour took into account a number of features favouring the prisoner. Although he was the first to use actual violence, he was not responsible for the situation which gave rise to it. Others in his group started things going. Secondly, the prisoner was not responsible for the use of weapons in the fight. Although he armed himself, he did so only because others had already done so. Thirdly, he and members of his group had not visited the garage with the intent to engage anyone in a fight. Next, the prisoner had no history of violence. His Honour accepted that this was an isolated incident of violence on his part, and he became involved because his friends were involved. 
     
      
    15   Then there was the plea of guilty. Although it was offered at a late stage, after the empanelment of the jury, his Honour was satisfied that the prisoner had indicated a long time before that he would plead guilty to affray. Up until commencement of the trial, the Crown had been proceeding against the prisoner for much more serious charges arising out of the death and the injury which occurred in the second incident. 
     
      
    16   Next, his Honour took into account the youth of the prisoner, who was 21 years old at the time of the offence and 23 at the time of the sentence. 
     
      
    17   His Honour also took into account the prisoner was in a stable partnership with his partner, and that he accepted responsibility as a father. His Honour considered that the prisoner had a settled life. Subsequent events show that his Honour was seriously misled about that. 
     
      
    18   Then his Honour took into account some co-operation between the prisoner and the police. 
     
      
    19   In the pre-sentence report dated 17 June 1999 the prisoner’s Probation and Parole officer considers that the prisoner does not require supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and that because of his previous unsatisfactory performance he is unsuitable to perform a further community service order. He is considered suitable for periodic detention. 
     
      
    20   The report of Anita Duffy, a consultant psychologist, has been put before the Court. Following tests, Miss Duffy concluded that the prisoner’s psychological profile conformed with most types described by the designers of tests as - 
     
      
       
        
        … tending under stress to go into a panic reaction which may lead to aggressive behaviour towards others or to themselves. They suffer from an immature personality and there is a lack of foresight. In a small sample surveyed, 90% had no further convictions after four years. 
        
       
      
    21   That summary seems remarkably accurate, considering the activity of the prisoner and the offence for which he was sentenced, and in his subsequent inappropriate reactions to stress, leading to his cessation of participation in his obligations under the community service order. 
     
      
    22   The report of Miss Duffy continues: 
     
      
       
        
        His main mode of dealing with stress has been to internalise it, until he reaches a peak where he “explodes”, often doing or saying things that he regrets later. This has led to arguments between himself and his girlfriend, and separations during this period which have further destabilised him. He has tended to react in a rather immature fashion, metaphorically throwing his hands in the air and ceasing his commitments. In this way his behaviours are short sighted and have repercussions which damage him in the long term. 
        
       
      
    23   Although the prisoner has been assessed as suitable to serve a period of periodic detention, I think that the author of the pre-sentence report might have come to a different view if he had seen the report to which I have just referred. The problem now is that the prisoner hopes to go back into a home situation with his girlfriend, with whom he has reconciled, and their two children. Stresses will come upon him again and when they do, they will affect his attitude to all his obligations, including any obligation he is put under by any order of this Court. I do not think, for that reason, and in view of the history of the matter, that he is a suitable subject for periodic detention. I think the appropriate order to make is a short term of full time detention. I note that the prisoner has been in custody since he was arrested on 2 May 1999. 
     
      
    24   Mr Tarawa, on the charge of affray I revoke the community service order. I sentence you to imprisonment for a fixed term of two months, commencing on 2 May 1999 and expiring on 1 July 1999. In imposing sentence, I take into account that the community service order was made and the work that you did under it and the attendances which you made under it. In relation to the separate offence constituted by your breach of the order, I take no action.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
        
       
      
     1     
     GROVE J : This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence imposed by Patten DCJ in the Sydney District Court. The applicant was sentenced in respect of a large number of counts of making a false instrument contrary to section 300(1) of the Crimes Act, an equivalent number of counts of using a false instrument contrary to section 300(2) and six counts of obtaining a valuable thing by deception. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The applicant is a young woman aged 22 years. The offences cover a span of time starting from when she was 16 years of age. There are some unusual features to this case which have provoked the Crown to invite the Court to admit evidence not called in the court below and to give effect to matters which would mitigate the sentence passed upon the applicant. 
      
       
      
     3     
     As commented in the helpful written submissions from the Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor, this is a case which cannot in any sense stand as a precedent for other cases and I would affirm my agreement with that contention. 
      
       
      
     4     
     As I have said the applicant was a very young woman. After she was charged she appeared before several judges of the District Court. On each occasion she was strongly advised to obtain legal advice and assistance. She rejected that advice, ultimately appearing as I have indicated for sentence following pleas of guilty. 
      
       
      
     5     
     There were technical reasons for the presentation of an indictment on the final occasion and the learned sentencing judge treated the matter as if the applicant had pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. That was patently a correct approach. 
      
       
      
     6     
     There is no need in the present circumstances for me to relate any detailed description of the offences. The vast bulk of them consisted of participation in a scheme whereby a large banking corporation was prevailed upon to pass money to the applicant from various accounts upon her representations to them and the production of some documentation for example by way of birth certificate, and moneys were given to her from other people's accounts. 
      
       
      
     7     
     The applicant when aged 16 became aware for the first time that she was not in every sense the child of her parents. This appears to have had quite a devastating effect upon her and I accept the suggestions in the evidence and in the psychological survey that to a substantial effect her misconduct and indeed her criminal conduct was provoked by reaction to this information. It suffices merely to mention that what was discovered by the applicant was that as her mother (as she believed her to be) had been found to be infertile an arrangement had been entered whereby she was born to her father and acquaintance of her “mother”. Upon learning this information she apparently sought to identify and have some contact with her birth mother but this was denied to her. In a state of some confusion she had what appears to have been the misfortune of winning a large amount of money from a poker machine whilst on a holiday. This became a misfortune because in her current state it provoked what can be described as a gambling addiction. The proceeds of her many offences were disbursed in order to feed that addiction. I should note in passing that for some of the offences the applicant was assisted by a co-offender and she has given information concerning the identity of that person. 
      
       
      
     8     
     The applicant's parents perceived that there was something wrong with their daughter and arranged for psychiatric assistance to be made available to her but she refused to attend appointment which had been made for her. I am persuaded that her refusal to participate in such arrangements is probably itself an indication of the state in which she was. 
      
       
      
     9     
     The learned sentencing judge was unassisted by any of the information that has now been made available to this court. That, of course, was a direct consequence of the applicant's refusal to seek advice or assistance which she had been urged to obtain by his Honour and his predecessors. As I have said, this case cannot stand as a precedent in any real sense and it should particularly stand as no encouragement to any person facing sentence in the District Court to refuse legal aid with any anticipation that the jurisdiction of this Court will thereby be provoked in relation to sentence. In this case, as I have indicated, the Crown has very fairly said that intervention should take place but it is because of the combination of most unusual factors. 
      
       
      
     10     
     The one matter that did occur in the District Court which might have been of assistance to the applicant in mitigation of sentence was evidence called from Christine Karanasiou, who described herself to the then presiding judge as a best friend of the applicant. It should be pointed out that the evidence of that witness was taken before a judge before whom the applicant was arraigned and not before Patten DCJ. In the remarks on sentence of the latter no notation is made indicating as to whether his Honour was aware of this testimony. It was significant in the sense that Miss Karanasiou had said that to her observation the applicant had overcome what I have described as the gambling addiction. To the extent that she made that effort at self-help and rehabilitation it was a matter that was available to be taken into account in favour of the applicant. 
      
       
      
     11     
     On the basis of the material which, as I have said, was manifestly inadequate before the District Court his Honour came to the conclusion that upon the offences contrary to section 300 of the Crimes Act the applicant should be sentenced to total terms of five years penal servitude which he divided into components of minimum and additional term of two and three years respectively having found special circumstances justifying extension of the additional term beyond the proportion mentioned in section 5(2) of the Sentencing Act. Like his Honour I would find that there are such special circumstances and they should have that effect in the sentence which this Court should reimpose. 
      
       
      
     12     
     On the offences of obtaining a valuable thing by deception the applicant was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of 12 months imprisonment. The applicant has been in custody for a little over six months. In written submissions senior counsel for the applicant invited the Court to consider whether the service of that period of custody was sufficient and whether this Court (intervening as invited both by the applicant and the Crown) should not make a further order of a non-custodial nature. 
      
       
      
     13     
     In my view the multiplicity of offences, their seriousness, the long term over which they were committed combine to make that approach entirely inappropriate. There are, as I have indicated, a number of matters which should be taken into account. The applicant's youth, even juvenile status, at the time of the commission of some of the offences should be taken into account. The absence of prior record is a significant matter. Nevertheless the offences, as I have indicated, were serious, were conscious and were committed by the applicant in order to pursue an activity from which her experience had taught her considerable gain without effort might be derived. 
      
       
      
     14     
     I have concluded that giving the applicant full benefit for all of the matters in mitigation including those which are set out in the affidavits filed and read today that it would be appropriate for this Court to intervene and in view of the sentences imposed upon the section 300 offences impose total terms concurrently of three years penal servitude divided into minimum and additional term components of 15 months and 21 months. The sentences for offences contrary to section 178BA will be subsumed within the minimum term component of those offences. 
      
       
      
     15     
     Accordingly I propose the following orders: That the application for leave to appeal against sentence be granted. That the appeal be allowed. That the sentences imposed upon the offences contrary to sections 300(1) and 300(2) of the Crimes Act be quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced on each count, to be served concurrently, to a total term of three years penal servitude to comprise a minimum term of one year and three months commencing on 26 November 1998 and expiring on 25 February 2000 together with an additional term of 21 months commencing on 26 February 2000. It should be ordered that the applicant be released to parole on 25 February 2000. The sentence of fixed term of 12 months imprisonment to be served concurrently commencing on 26 November 1998 and expiring 25 November 1999 in respect of each of the offences contrary to section 178BA of the Crimes Act should be confirmed.

    IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL 60308/98  GROVE J CARRUTHERS AJ  MONDAY 7 JUNE 1999 REGINA v VINCENT JOHN VIRGONAJUDGMENT1 CARRUTHERS AJ: Vincent John Virgona seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by Kirkham DCJ at the Dubbo District Court on 15 May 1998 when, following pleas of guilty, the applicant was sentenced on the following offences: As to counts 1 and 2 - indecent assault on a male pursuant to s 81 of the Crimes Act 1900 (to which I shall later refer as ""the Act""). - This offence carries a maximum penalty of five years penal servitude. As to counts 3, 6 and 7 - homosexual intercourse with a male between the age of ten and eighteen years - pursuant to s 78K of the Act, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years penal servitude, and as to count 5, an act of gross indecency towards a male person under the age of eighteen years - pursuant to s 78Q(1) of the Act, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for two years. 2 These various offences were committed over the period January 1983 to approximately January 1990.3 On 15 May 1998, the applicant was sentenced as follows: As to counts 3, 6 and 7, to a minimum term of four years and six months penal servitude, to commence on 15 May 1998 and to expire on 14 November 2002. An additional term was imposed of one year and six months to commence on 15 November 2002 and to expire on 14 May 2004. As to counts 1, 2 and 5, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of twelve months to commence on 15 May 1998 and to expire on 14 May 1999. 4 It is relevant to note for sentencing purposes that the applicant was presented for trial at the District Court on 16 March 1998 upon an indictment containing eight counts of sexual assault alleged to have been committed upon a male complainant, who was the nephew of the applicant by marriage. 5 On 17 March 1998 the applicant, after the complainant had given probably most but not all of his evidence-in-chief, but, of course, before he was cross-examined, pleaded guilty to six of the counts in the indictment. By consent the jury were discharged without verdict in respect of the remaining two counts of 4 and 8.6 The complainant was born on 12 December 1974 and the applicant was born on 22 June 1948. I do not think that any purpose would be served by detailing the sexual indignities which the applicant, in a position of trust, inflicted upon his nephew, some twenty-six years his junior. 7 Kirkham DCJ, having recited a summary of facts relied upon by the Crown and admitted by the applicant, said in his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""From these facts it can be seen that over a period of many years from when the complainant was aged nine, up to a time when he was between 14 and 16 years of age, the accused engaged in a course of reprehensible conduct in self gratification of his rampant paedophilia.""  
         
        
       
       
      
    8 His Honour expressed the view that there were no special circumstances.9 The present application is based essentially upon two grounds. It is said that the effective sentence imposed by his Honour was excessive in consequence of, firstly, inadequate weight having been given to the evidence of rehabilitation and, secondly, the failure of his Honour to find special circumstances justifying the departure from what was referred to as ""the statutory ratio"" between minimum and additional terms. 10 In sentencing the applicant, his Honour took the view that the offences were in the upper range of seriousness for these type of offences. Secondly, that it was an appropriate case for the application of the principle of totality. His Honour took into account that the applicant sought treatment for his paedophilia at about the time of the commission of the last of the series of offences, that the applicant's history revealed that he himself was the victim of sexual abuse by a family friend between the ages of nine and thirteen years involving similar conduct to that which the applicant admitted performing on the present complainant. 11 For some years the applicant has been in a heterosexual de facto relationship with one Miss Russell, which is of a stable nature; effectively the applicant has no prior criminal record and the applicant was entitled to the benefit of the ultimate pleas of guilty, albeit as they were late this would not attract the same discount as if there had been such pleas ab initio. 12 Specifically, his Honour accepted that there had been some rehabilitation and ""hopefully that rehabilitation will continue"". 13 Finally, as I have indicated, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""There is no submission which I can accept which would attract the consideration of the existence of special circumstances in this matter."" 
         
        
       
       
      
    14 In submissions before us, Mr Rosser QC, counsel for the applicant, made the point that the applicant has always denied the charges contained in the fourth and the eighth counts, particularly in relation to the eighth count which alleged sexual assault upon the complainant between 30 June 1993 and 1 September 1993, a date well after that when the applicant sought, of his own motion, counselling. 15 The basis of the submissions before his Honour in mitigation of penalty was that the consequence of that counselling was that the applicant had attained a position of complete rehabilitation. This, Mr Rosser has stressed, is totally inconsistent with any concession by him that he committed a sexual offence against the complainant as late as 1993. Mr Rosser also put to us that in the evidence given before the jury the complainant had not come up to proof on count 4 and had not reached the stage of giving any evidence with regard to count 8. Mr Rosser put to us that it was because mainly (or perhaps entirely) of the justifiable refusal on the part of the applicant to concede the commission of the fourth and the eighth counts that it was appropriate that the applicant plead not guilty to the entire eight counts in the indictment. He also stressed that there was evidence before his Honour that the applicant had been engaging actively in charitable works which emphasised his rehabilitation.16 With regard to the question of special circumstances, I would just very briefly refer to the recent decisions in this Court relating to special circumstances under s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act 1989. 17 As the Chief Justice has said regarding special circumstances, what is involved, if the Court makes a decision that there are special circumstances, is that this triggers the exercise of the discretion as to whether or not the existence of such circumstances justifies an additional term in excess of one-third of the minimum term. 18 It is quite artificial to approach the matter in a two-stage manner. The only point in making the preliminary finding is if it justifies an additional term in excess of one-third of the minimum term. 19 The Chief Justice said there is in truth only one question: Are there special circumstances which justify a larger additional term than one-third of the minimum term? A finding by the sentencing judge that there were no special circumstances would, therefore, generally involve a finding that there were no such special circumstances as would justify the imposition of an additional term longer than the one-third period. This is a discretionary decision (see Hampton, C.C.A. unreported 25 June 1998).20 The decision to vary the statutory proportion requires consideration not only of the desirability of increasing the additional term, but also the appropriateness of reducing the minimum term which must, nevertheless, remain such as appropriately reflects the criminality involved (Morrisey, unreported 15 July 1994). The objective criminality of the offence should be reflected not only in the full term but also in the minimum term (McDonald, C.C.A. unreported 12 October 1998). And finally, although it may be open to a sentencing judge in the exercise of his or her discretion to regard certain circumstances as special circumstances, the Judge is not bound to respond to the circumstances by setting an additional term which is in excess of one-third of the minimum term (GDR (1994) 35 NSWLR 376). 21 Applying these principles, this was, in my view, essentially a case in which Kirkham DCJ was entitled to take the view that there were no special circumstances which justified the imposition of an additional term longer than one-third of the minimum period. 22 The objective circumstances were very serious indeed. It has been recognised on many occasions that the legislature expects the Courts to punish sexual assaults on young children severely (see Eagles, C.C.A. unreported 16 December 1993 and MFG, C.C.A. unreported 7 November 1997). 23 Two very significant objective circumstances in the instant case were the period of time over which these offences were committed on a young boy passing from childhood to adolescence then teenage years, together with the breach of trust involved by reason of the family relationship. Reference to the report of the Wood Royal Commission dealing with paedophilia demonstrates the growing public concern about the extent of paedophilia in the community and this Court must not be insensitive to this concern nor, of course, must sentencing judges. 24 I am of the opinion that Kirkham DCJ took the view, and in my respectful view rightly took the view, that the late pleas of guilty in this matter militated against a finding by him that rehabilitation could be looked upon as being complete. He rightly, in my respectful view, took the view, however, that there was some rehabilitation and clearly gave an appropriate discount in that regard. 25 I am of the view, having given careful consideration to the matters that have been raised in the detailed written submissions and the helpful oral submissions of Mr Rosser on behalf of the appellant, that no error has been demonstrated in the sentencing regime imposed by his Honour. Both the minimum terms, which had to reflect the criminality involved, and the additional terms were well within his Honour's sentencing discretion.26 Accordingly, in the circumstances I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 27 GROVE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Carruthers AJ. The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as he proposed.

     JUDGMENT 
      
    2 IRELAND J: The appellant, Mark John Baker, was indicted on 12 August, 1997 before his Honour Acting Judge Cantrill in the Campbelltown District Court on two counts, alleging that he on 23 November, 1996 at Minto in the State of New South Wales did maliciously wound Linda Baker with intent to murder her in contravention of S 27 of the Crimes Act, 1900 and in the alternative, that he on the same date and at the same place did maliciously wound Linda Baker with intent to do grievous bodily harm in contravention of S 33 of the Crimes Act, 1900.3 Each of these offences carries a maximum penalty of 25 years penal servitude.4 The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count and was tried by his Honour sitting alone. The appellant represented himself.5 On 15 August, 1997 the appellant was found not guilty of counts 1 and 2 on the indictment, but was found guilty on a further statutory alternative charge of malicious wounding, pursuant to S 35 of the Crimes Act, 1900. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 7 years penal servitude.6 The appellant was sentenced on 15 August, 1997 to 2 years penal servitude to commence on 11 December, 1996 and to expire on 10 December, 1998 with a 2 year additional term commencing on 11 December, 1998 and to expire on 10 December, 2000. Accordingly, the appellant has served the minimum term of his sentence.7 The Crown case may be briefly summarised as follows:-8 The appellant and the victim had been married. There were three children of the marriage. The victim and the appellant were living together until November of 1995 when they separated. In December 1995 the appellant moved back into the former matrimonial home without the victim’s consent.9 On 4 March 1996 there was an incident between the appellant and the victim which resulted in the victim suffering a number of injuries and an apprehended violence order was obtained against the appellant who pleaded guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm arising from that incident.10 A second incident occurred involving the victim and the appellant and regardless of the apprehended violence order, there was continual contact between the appellant and the victim by telephone. During the course of these conversations, threats were made to the victim by the appellant.11 An incident occurred on 22 November, 1996 when the appellant was served with Family Law related documents, which he tore into two pieces saying to the process server words to the effect that he would not be in the country on the relevant date.12 The next day, 23 November, the incident being the subject of the indictment took place.13 The victim gave evidence that she returned home from work at 12.30 am. She was waiting for her son to return from work at McDonalds and expected him home about 2.30 am. About 12.40 am the victim remembered she had not locked the tailgate of her car. She went outside to attend to this and heard a car, which she said sounded familiar, come up the street from her right. She walked up the driveway and had stepped out onto the gutter. The victim saw the appellant’s car. She thought the appellant was about to park, as the car had slowed down. She intended to say something to the appellant about being in contravention of the apprehended violence order. She saw the car coming towards her and before she knew what had happened, she had been hit by the front grille and thrown on top of the bonnet of the appellant’s vehicle.14 The victim recalled waking up in bed in her home from where she could see ambulance officers who had placed a brace on her neck. She recalled police officers standing in the doorway of her bedroom. She was conveyed to Campbelltown Hospital, where she stayed until the following Tuesday. The victim gave evidence of having been in severe pain in her shoulders, head, stomach, legs and ankles. She had ringing in her ears and had received fifteen sutures to a full thickness head wound.15 These injuries to the victim were described in evidence by her general practitioner, who attended her after discharge from hospital.16 At 12.30 am on 23 November, 1996, within minutes of the impact, the appellant attended Campbelltown Police Station where he said to a police officer “I’ve hit my wife, I’ve run her over”. He was asked if she was all right and replied “No she’s still on the road”. He appeared distressed at that time. He continued to cry and was told to sit down. A police officer, who inspected the appellant’s motor vehicle, observed some fresh damage to the plastic grille, part of which was missing, and saw marks which appeared to be scuff marks in the centre of the bonnet.17 The bruising observed on the victim, and recorded in photographs, was consistent with the zig-zag configuration of the broken grille of the appellant’s motor vehicle.18 The appellant entered into an electronically recorded interview regarding the incident in which he said the victim came out on to the road and he hit her, however, when he saw the victim his foot remained on the accelerator.19 The appellant gave evidence in which he denied the version of events given by the victim regarding the 4th March, 1996 incident, however, he admitted having hit the victim in the past. He admitted being served with the Family Law documents on 22nd November, 1996, but otherwise rejected the evidence in the Crown case in relation to this.20 The appellant gave evidence that on 23 November, he had driven down the street where the victim lived to see if the lights were on in the house. He had been aware of the lateness of the evening, however, he knew the victim and their son Jason worked late hours. He said that if he had seen the lights on he would have known that they were awake and he would have moved out of the area to make a telephone call to the victim to discuss whether Jason could assist him in some renovation work.21 In evidence given by the appellant in cross-examination, he stated that the victim had run out in front of his car and that he had not purposely run her over. He gave further evidence that he had not seen the body, just a flash. He had been travelling and then “she come running out across the - in the middle of the street”. He had not used his brakes at all but swerved to miss her and as the victim rolled to the side he continued on his way. He only slowed down for an intersection that he knew existed in the area. (T.207.54-208.05)22 There are four grounds of appeal.23 Ground 1: The Judge erred in his directions on malice.24 The submission is made that although the sentencing judge outlined the statutory definition of “malice” (S 5 of the Crimes Act) at no other point in the summing up did he turn his mind to the meaning of “recklessness”.25 The further submission is made that the case depended entirely on the account given by the complainant, whom the judge found to be an unsatisfactory and unconvincing witness. Particular reference is made to that part of the judgment in which the trial judge stated “She was not in my view, a particularly impressive witness and I regard her as prone to exaggeration in respect of the events she described and unreliable in others”. (At p 5.) Reference is also made to the passage of the judgment in which the following appears:-26 “I find the suggestion that she lost consciousness and only regained it when she was apparently already on her feet, being led back to the house, as not credible”. (At p 6)27 In this latter regard, it must be remembered that this was a reference not to the events giving rise to the charges which the appellant faced, but was a description of events relating to an assault on the victim by the appellant on the 3rd March, 1996 to which the appellant pleaded guilty. This incident was the foundation for the apprehended violence order restraining the appellant.28 In support of this ground, counsel for the appellant relies upon the fact that the trial judge was not satisfied as to the intention of the appellant to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm and hence returned verdicts of not guilty on the two counts on the indictment, but nevertheless found “I am, however, satisfied that he either intended to cause her some injury or at the very least, was reckless as to whether or not she was hurt” (emphasis added) (judgment P 15-16). Hence, so the argument runs, the reference to “recklessness”, identifies the aspect of “malice” which formed the basis of the finding of guilt on the statutory alternative count. It is submitted that the judge failed to direct himself that “recklessness” embodies a realisation on the part of the accused that the particular kind of harm in fact done might be inflicted and, at the relevant time, the accused had a foresight of the possible consequences and a willingness to act irrespective of that foresight. Cited is R -v- Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467 and Stokes and Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25.29 The absence of a finding that the appellant did foresee the possibility of injury to the complainant, is said to constitute a breach of S 33(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, which requires that “A judgment by a Judge in any such case (sitting without a jury) must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied”30 This breach, it is submitted, involves a wrong decision in terms of the second limb of S 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act.31 The submission is made that because the trial judge was not satisfied that the appellant drove his motor vehicle at the complainant with the necessary intention to kill her, or to cause her grievous bodily harm, it necessarily follows that he could not have been satisfied on the criminal standard of proof that the appellant “… either intended to cause her some injury or at the very least, was reckless as to whether or not she was hurt”.32 Whilst there may be, in circumstances such as those prevailing in the present case, a fine line between the intention necessarily to be found as an element of charges laid under Ss 27 and 33 of the Crimes Act and a finding of malicious wounding under S 35, the distinction nevertheless is critical and where the tribunal of fact is not satisfied to the requisite degree as to the element of intent the proper course is to consider the statutory alternative count.33 The finding by the trial judge that the appellant saw and recognised his wife in his path and “in a momentary explosion of anger at all the injustices he believed had been heaped upon him at her instigation ... at the very least, did not bother to try to avoid her ...” is, in my view, clearly capable of supporting a finding that the act was done “maliciously” based upon “reckless” behaviour.34 The duty imposed upon the trial judge by S 33(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986 is to include in his judgment the principles of law applied by him and the findings of fact relied upon. This duty, in my view, does not require the restatement of the definition of every defined word, e.g., “reckless”: the facts found by the trial judge full justify the conclusion reached that the appellant was reckless. 35 This ground is not made out.36 Ground 2:  The Judge failed to refer in his reasons for judgment to a warning that the complainant’s evidence may be unreliable and was to be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion was arrived at and a verdict of guilty delivered.37 The victim’s evidence was central to the Crown case. She and the appellant were the only persons present and the Crown case necessarily depended upon her evidence.38 The trial judge found it to be “patently evident” when the victim was giving evidence she harboured a substantial degree of “bitterness bordering on outright animosity towards the accused, her former husband”, which predated the events which were the subject of the indictment. She was regarded by the trial judge as not being “… a particularly impressive witness …” who was “… prone to exaggeration in respect of the events she described and unreliable in others”.39 I accept the submission made on behalf of the appellant that had this been a case conducted with a jury it would have been necessary to stress to the jury that, there being only one witness asserting the commission of the offence, the evidence of that witness was essentially to be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion was arrived at and a verdict of guilty brought in. Regina -v- Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 @ 19. See also Longman -v- The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 @ 107; Fleming -v- Regina  158 ALR 379.40 Section 33 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986 provides:-41 “33. Verdict of single Judge42 (1) A Judge who tries criminal proceedings without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of the guilt of the accused person. Any such findings has, for all purposes, the same effect as a verdict of a jury.43 (2) A judgment by a Judge in any such case must include the principles of law applied by the Judge and the findings of fact on which the Judge relied.44 (3) If any Act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury in any such case, the Judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter.”45 The High Court of Australia in Fleming, with respect to the requirement to take a warning into account said in the judgment of the Court at 389 [31] and following:-46 “Section 33(3) is framed in a fashion which differs from that of s 33(2) and which emphasises the particular importance attached by the legislature to the requirements of the law with respect to warnings. Section 33(2) requires the inclusion of principles of law applied and of factual findings relied upon, while s 33(3) obliges the judge to take the particular warning into account.”47 The evidence of the victim in the circumstances of this case would have warranted a warning under S 165 of the Evidence Act. Had the case been conducted with a jury, it would have been incumbent upon the trial judge to inform the legally unrepresented appellant of his right to request a warning pursuant to S 165.48 Notwithstanding the obvious care with which Acting Judge Cantrill approached the function of a trial judge sitting without a jury, his reasons for judgment do not disclose expressly or by implication, that the principle of law relating to an appropriate warning as to the evidence of the victim was applied. In these circumstances, it should be taken that the principle was not applied, rather than applied and not recorded; Fleming at 389[30].49 In my view, there was a failure by the trial judge to include in his judgment reference to the warning which was required to be given to a jury. There was demonstrated, accordingly, a breach of S 33(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, that the judge “take the warning into account”, which constituted a wrong decision on a question of law attracting the second limb of S 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act.50 This ground of appeal should be upheld.51 Ground 3: His Honour erred in his directions by failing to refer in his reasons for judgment to the principles of law concerning lies told by the appellant52 In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge at p 2 said “Consciousness of guilt is something which may be inferred from other things, of telling lies either in or out of Court or in the course of evidence”.53 In considering the evidence of the appellant, the trial judge at p 14 of his reasons for judgment said:-54 “The most significant feature is that at no stage during the interview did it appear the accused was in any doubt whatsoever as to the identity of the person whom he struck with his vehicle and was indeed extremely concerned for her welfare.55 However, in cross-examination by the Crown he claimed he did not know who or what had struck the vehicle. He did not recognise the person or object and did not even see a face, just a body. He tried to avoid it be steering away, but she hit the car. He says “I just saw a flash of like white. I didn’t even see a distinct legs or arms or body. I just saw a flash of white and I tried to steer to the right. If it was a big bird or a dog I was still trying to veer away from that object”.56 This is totally inconsistent in my view, with what he told the police only a short time later and possibly the one part of the accused’s evidence I cannot accept.”57 The submission is made, on behalf of the appellant, that it was open to the trial judge to reject the evidence of the appellant, however if he were to reject what was in effect crucial evidence of the appellant going, as it did to his awareness of the person he struck with his motor vehicle being his wife, and were to rely upon the rejected evidence as a lie told as a result of consciousness of guilt, a number of directions should have been adverted to as having been taken into account. They include: the evidence must reveal a deliberate lie, not an error or an untruth arising from confusion; the lie must clearly be shown to be a lie by evidence other than that to be corroborated; the lie is only to be taken into account if it revealed knowledge of the offence or some aspect of the offence and because of a realisation of guilt or fear of the truth. The further submission is made that the trial judge should have warned himself that there may be reasons for a lie other than consciousness of guilt such as panic. Edwards -v- The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193; R -v- Lucas (1981) 1 QB 720 and further that the fact that a lie has been told does not of itself establish a proposition to the contrary. Edmunds -v- Edmunds and Ayscough (1935) VLR 177.58 The respondent contends that the finding by the trial judge that the appellant’s evidence in this regard was untrue would warrant the conclusion that the evidence amounted to a lie told because of consciousness of guilt. Justification for this contention is supported by reference to the findings of fact available to and made by the trial judge.59 However, the fact that a conclusion by a trial judge sitting alone may be justified is not enough. He or she must enunciate the principles of law applied as well as the findings of fact relied on.60 In my view, this was not done and a breach of S 33(2) has occurred.61 This ground of appeal also should be upheld.62 Ground 4: The conviction is unsafe and unsatisfactory.63 The appellant submits that the sufficiency and quality of the evidence is such as to preclude satisfaction on the criminal standard that the appellant was guilty of “malicious wounding”. Reliance is placed on the criticisms of the complainant’s evidence by the trial judge.64 The respondent submits it does not follow that because the trial judge had doubts as to whether the appellant intended to cause grievous bodily harm, that he ought to have doubts as to whether the appellant intended to cause any injury at all. The very nature of what the appellant did is eloquent as to his lack of regard for the avoidance of injury to the victim.65 The respondent has summarised twelve aspects of the evidence upon which the Court could rely in reaching the conclusion that the appellant was guilty of an offence under S 35 of the Crimes Act.66 My own view is that there was ample evidence upon which the trial judge could rely in reaching the conclusions he arrived at.67 This ground of appeal fails.68 The matters raised in Grounds 2 and 3 give rise to substantive questions of law and application of the proviso is inappropriate.69 I would propose the following:-70 1. The appeal be allowed.71 2. The conviction and sentence quashed.72 3. A new trial ordered.73 Whether a new trial should be undertaken, in view of the events which have transpired, is a discretionary matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.

     REGINA v Scott John HILL 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   BARR J: The applicant, Scott John Hill, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court. On 3 February 1998 he pleaded guilty in the Local Court to ten counts of breaking, entering and stealing and one of receiving stolen property. On 11 August 1998 Judge Nield imposed ten concurrent terms, each of five years penal servitude on the breaking, entering and stealing counts and a concurrent fixed term of two years on the receiving count. The effective sentence was therefore one of five years comprising a minimum term of two and a half years and an additional term of two and a half years. 
     
      
    2   The applicant was a single man of eighteen years seven months of age in September 1997 when, in company with another young man, he carried out a series of break-ins in dwelling houses in the Blue Mountains near where he was living. As his Honour said, there was nothing remarkable about the individual offences. All were committed whilst the houses concerned were unoccupied. They were planned. They netted property worth about $30,000, 15,000 or so of which has not been recovered. On 30 January 1998, the applicant received the goods stolen in a further break-in. 
     
      
    3   The applicant’s criminal record did not help him. In August 1996 he and an unidentified friend stole a car and damaged it. In September 1996, whilst on bail for those two offences, he and an unidentified friend broke into three motor vehicles and stole property from them. A two year recognisance resulted from those offences. He was subject to that recognisance when he committed the eleven offences for which his Honour sentenced him. He was on bail for the ten break and enters when he committed the offence of receiving. 
     
      
    4   The first ground of appeal is that the sentence is manifestly excessive by comparison with sentencing statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission. Of 133 accused who pleaded guilty to multiple offences of breaking, entering and stealing, between 1994 and 1998, only twenty-four received sentences of five years or more. Twenty accused of age twenty-one or younger were sentenced for multiple counts and only two of them received terms of five years or more. However, it appears from material tendered by the Crown that those offenders all or almost all pleaded guilty. It was submitted that since the applicant was only eighteen years and seven months of age at the time of ten of the eleven offences, the sentences imposed showed that his Honour gave insufficient weight to his youth. It was put that the primary aim in sentencing young offenders is the promotion of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    5   Reference was made to R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 and the well known case of R v Smith [1964] Crim LR 70. It was submitted that the principle had particular application to the applicant because his Honour found that he had ceased to drink alcohol, had been accepted into a respectable family, had got himself a job and had enrolled in a technical college course. It was put that a sentence towards the top end of the range was too high for someone like the applicant who was remorseful for his offences. 
     
      
    6   The offences in combination were very serious and his Honour was bound to impose a substantial sentence. Although the applicant was a young man, he was not a child or a young person who might have relied particularly heavily on the principles set forth in the cases I have cited. Although he was an adult, he was still young, however, and was not yet of an age, even taking into account his modest criminal experience, that denied him the benefit of those principles. 
     
      
    7   The recognisance which bound the applicant at the time of all the offences was a serious aggravation. Even after he had been granted bail on the ten charges of breaking, entering and stealing, he committed the eleventh offence. As his Honour said - 
     
      
       
        
        The breaking, entering and stealing offences are prevalent offences. They are relatively easy to commit and they are relatively difficult to identify the offender. They cause members of the community to feel afraid by the invasion of their home and privacy and they result in the victims losing property, often of little but sentimental value. They impose considerable costs upon both the victims and insurance companies. They support corrupt people who buy the stolen property knowing it to be have been stolen. The community demands as it is entitled to demand that the police protect its members against people who break into and enter its members homes and steal property therefrom, and it expects and it is entitled to expect that the courts will punish appropriately offenders who commit breaking, entering and stealing offences and receiving offences. 
        
       
      
    8   The applicant also abused information that was available to him in order to pick his targets. One of the offences was against his father. He stole items of obvious sentimental and personal value. The offences of course were numerous. 
     
      
    9   However, even taking into account the combined seriousness of the offences, it seems to me in view of the age of the applicant and the quite remarkable evidence that he had already begun the process of rehabilitation, sentences so close to the upper limit of the range were inappropriate, for that is where these sentences lie when compared with the statistical information put before the Court. 
     
      
    10   The evidence about the applicant’s rehabilitation may be summarised as follows. The last offence for which his Honour was sentencing him was committed in January 1998. There was abundant evidence to justify his Honour’s finding that for some time before the commission of these offences, including the time of the offences of 1996 and for some time afterwards, the applicant was in a very bad way in his consumption of alcohol. He was drinking every day to excess and it does not overstate the position I think to say that alcohol had taken over his life. There was evidence of this before his Honour, but it was not put forward as providing an explanation, that is to say, a causal explanation for the offences. As a dominating feature in his life however, it was of the greatest importance. By the time the applicant came before his Honour, he had had the very good fortune to have been adopted, using that term in a loose and practical sense, by a responsible family and to have forsworn, apparently successfully, the use of alcohol altogether. As I said earlier in this judgment, he got himself a job, he began a technical college course. The pattern of his life was in stark contrast to the pattern which had obtained at the time of the commission of the offences. 
     
      
    11   It seems to me that those circumstances, combined with the applicant’s age, needed to be given very great weight, and the length of the total sentence of five years suggests to me that his Honour gave those features insufficient weight. 
     
      
    12   The second ground of appeal asserts that his Honour gave insufficient weight to the circumstances in which the applicant attended the police station voluntarily with his mother and confessed his offences. It was put that the police would otherwise not have charged him with three of them. A summary of the position seems to be as follows. The police had searched the applicant’s garage and might be supposed to have been able to connect the applicant with eight of the ten breaking, entering and stealing offences. They might not have been able to prove that he was involved in the stealing, of course, and the Crown might have had to be content with convictions for receiving. It was put that on that basis the applicant was entitled to a partial discount for having volunteered his criminality to the police. In respect of the two remaining offences, there was apparently nothing in the garage to link him with them and it is put that his volunteering his commission of those offences to the police gave them a case against him whereas they would otherwise have had no case. 
     
      
    13   There is some force in these submissions I think, though in the scheme of things it does not weigh very heavily with me. It is really a matter of conjecture what the police could have proved if the applicant had not volunteered his part in these offences. A feature which it is impossible to evaluate is the fact that his co-offender, whom he refused to name to the police, had been arrested. The applicant might very well have been motivated by a belief, justified or otherwise, that the co-offender might give him up to the police. Even so, I think that these considerations are entitled to some weight. 
     
      
    14   Because of what I see as his Honour’s failure to give sufficient weight to the age and rehabilitation of the applicant, I think that the Court should interfere with the sentences imposed. I would propose that the effective total term be reduced to four years. The question of the minimum term arises and I think that there are special circumstances which justify the fixing of an effective additional term exceeding one-third of the minimum term, principally because of the aspects of rehabilitation to which I have already referred. 
     
      
    15   Material has been put before the Court which shows that since sentence the applicant has been doing very well in gaol. He is very well regarded. He is a hard worker. He applies himself not only to his work but to courses, notably drug and alcohol counselling courses, and he seems to be resolute and successful in his efforts to stay away from alcohol. He will need some assistance when he gets out of gaol because he will be in a community where the temptations to drink will probably be more pressing than they are now and there will be a risk that he will slip back. However, he is well on the way to rehabilitation. 
     
      
    16   I think that an additional term of two years when he will be subject to the supervision of the probation and parole service will be appropriate. I propose the following orders; that leave be granted to appeal against the sentences and that the appeal be allowed, that the ten sentences on the breaking, entering and stealing offences be quashed and that in lieu the appellant be sentenced to ten concurrent sentences, each of four years’ penal servitude commencing on 11 August 1998, each sentence to comprise a minimum term of two years and an additional term of two years. The appellant would be eligible for release on parole on 10 August 2000. 
     
      
    17   McINERNEY: I agree. 
     
      
    18   BARR J: The orders of the Court are therefore as I have proposed.

     ON SENTENCE 
      
      
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: On Wednesday of last week David Bradley Leonard, [“the prisoner”], was presented in this Court for trial upon an indictment charging tht he had murdered, on 12 October 1997 at South Windsor, one Glenda Norris, [“the deceased]”. The prisoner pleaded not guilty, and he was put accordingly upon trial by jury. Yesterday morning the jury returned a verdict finding the prisoner guilty as charged. Submissions on sentence were made yesterday afternoon; and the passing of sentence was fixed for this afternoon. 
    2   At trial the prisoner did not dispute that he had by an unlawful act caused the death in question; and he did not dispute that such act had been accompanied by the intent either to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. The prisoner’s case depended entirely upon his claim that he had acted in response to provocation in the sense recognised by the law as reducing culpability for an unlawful killing from that of murder to that of manslaughter. This issue was clearly articulated; and was fought out, on both sides of the record, with a clarity and an economy that were admirable in their professionalism. 
    3   The objective facts can be summarised as follows: 
    4   The prisoner met the deceased in about December 1996. A relationship between them developed; and in late May 1997 they began to live together. The deceased had previously worked as a prostitute, a fact that she disclosed to the prisoner. The two of them discussed that aspect of her past; and, according to the prisoner, they agreed that she would not work in that way while ever they were together. 
    5   The deceased had other and difficult personal problems. She regularly abused alcohol. She regularly injected methadone and another prescription drug. She appears to have been very self-willed; and she appears to have been capable of speaking and of behaving in a very coarse fashion. She was some 10 years older that the prisoner, who, although not without some prior sexual experience, had lived, certainly by comparison with the deceased, a sheltered and low-key personal and social life. 
    6   At trial the prisoner gave extensive evidence of what, according to him, had been the course of his relationship with the deceased, particularly from the period July/August 1997, following the death of a man who had been a close personal friend of the deceased. The prisoner supported his account by reference to contemporaneous diary notes. Even if it be accepted, as I think common sense alone would suggest, that the diary notes are at best brief paraphrases of what they describe, it was, nevertheless, not contended at the trial either that they were fabricated, or that they were in some other way wholly unreliable as a source from which an outside observer might obtain a reasonably fair general idea of what the relationship entailed in its day to day existence. 
    7   The picture that thus emerges is one of a relationship that was, on both sides, emotionally brittle; and that moved in frequent and volatile swings from one of comparative stability and mutual affection, to one of mutual acrimony, of mutual recrimination, and of occasional physical violence. The whole course of the relationship, whatever its particular phase of the moment, appears to have been overshadowed by continuous excessive drinking and drug abuse on the part of the deceased. The prisoner was not a drug abuser, but he, too, seems to have drunk intoxicating liquor, at least from time to time, in excessive quantities. 
    8   On 12 October, the prisoner and the deceased went to the South Windsor RSL Club which was situated a short drive away from where they were then living. Their relationship was, at this time, very strained. They had been arguing, according to the prisoner, almost continuously since 9 October. At the Club, the deceased was approached by a man whom it seems she knew from her days of active prostitution. During a temporary absence of the prisoner, the deceased apparently agreed to leave in the company of this other man. Before she could actually do so, the prisoner returned; saw what was happening, and had a major confrontation with the deceased outside the Club premises. Their argument was loud, abusive and public. Persons nearby, and who gave evidence at the trial, described how the deceased had asked one of them to stop the prisoner from harassing her. In the end, the deceased went off with her acquaintance, leaving the prisoner, in his own words, “angry, depressed, hurt”. 
    9   There was evidence from one Crown witness that she had heard the prisoner, as it were, fire a parting shot at the deceased in these words: “I’ll be waiting at home to kill you”. The prisoner himself gave evidence that he could not now recall whether or not he had said so. I can imagine that it was just the thing that the prisoner might well have said, given the ambient emotional temperature; but there is no evidence to support the one Crown witness’s recollection of the words, and I think that the fair approach would be to give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt. 
    10   After the foregoing events, the prisoner left the Club. He drove home, being sufficiently in possession of his faculties to realise that he was not driving safely, and to stop, accordingly, until he had composed himself. He drove to his place of work; parked outside for a period; and then decided to go home, pack his bags and leave. 
    11   Upon his arrival home, the prisoner began to pack his bags. He was, in his own words, “shattered, angry, hurt, upset”. As he packed, he came upon an old, but functioning, revolver stored among his clothing, and a quantity of ammunition. He loaded the revolver with six rounds of ammunition, intending to take his own life. He realised that the notion was, in his own word, “insane”. He telephoned his mother and she tried to calm him down. While he was so engaged, the deceased returned home. 
    12   The deceased was intoxicated and aggressive. She and the prisoner had a fiercely abusive argument during the course of which she tormented him about his sexual prowess and about what she had been doing, and was planning to go on doing, in pursuit of what she described as “having a good time”. The prisoner, by this time, had placed the loaded revolver in the back of the waistband of his jeans. At the height of the exchanges between him and the deceased, he pulled out the revolver, cocked it, took up the firing stance of an experienced shooter, - which the prisoner in fact was, - said “bye bye baby” or “bye bye dear”, and, from a distance somewhere between one and three feet, shot the deceased though the forehead, killing her instantly. 
    13   The prisoner realised immediately the enormity of what he had done. He tried to fire a second shot through his own jaw, but only managed to fire in such a way that the bullet skimmed across the side of his neck and lodged in the ceiling. Thereafter, and in a highly agitated state, he called the ambulance and the police. He was arrested very late on the evening of 12 October and has been in unbroken custody since the arrest. He co-operated fully with the investigating police. 
    14   It is, I think, beyond questioning that the verdict of the jury expresses a conclusion, reached beyond reasonable doubt, that an ordinary person in the position of the prisoner at the time he shot the deceased could not have responded to any demonstrated provocation offered by the deceased by so far losing his self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased. With such a conclusion I entirely agree. 
    15   It must follow, in my opinion, that the shooting by the prisoner of the deceased was a crime of very high culpability. It is the paramount purpose of the rule of law in any truly civilised society to protect unflinchingly the sanctity of human life. In such a society it is the paramount duty of the Courts to give, unflinchingly, full and public effect to that purpose. That purpose and duty are especially important in such a society as our own, where mutual marital fidelity has been largely supplanted by extra-marital liaisons of various kinds, many of which, as the daily experience of the Court makes plain, are all too apt to break down in circumstances of great bitterness. That entails, in its turn, that there cannot, and must not, be allowed to develop in society any perception that it is in any way permissible for an aggrieved party to such a breakdown to lash out in self-absorbed frustration to the extent of killing, - or, indeed, of inflicting any other bodily harm upon, - either the other party to the breakdown, or any third party, who is thought to be involved in, or responsible for, the breakdown. 
    16   It is, of course, necessary to take into proper account for present purposes not only the objective gravity of the prisoner’s offence and its concomitant need for 59 
    17   deterrence and retribution in aid of proper public protection, but also the demonstrated personal circumstances of the prisoner. They can be summarised as follow. 
    18   The prisoner was born on 15 August 1969. He was aged a little over 28 years at the time of the killing; and is now aged 29 years and some 9 months. He has no criminal antecedents. 
    19   The prisoner was educated at school to year 10. Thereafter he worked at various times in catering-related employment; in a scrap-metal business of his own; and in the Army. Shortly before October 1997 he had commenced working in a factory; and there is in evidence, as Exhibit 1 on sentence, a commendatory reference from that employer. Additional, and more personal, commendations are in evidence as Exhibit 2 on sentence. I accept what is said in Exhibits 1 and 2. 
    20   The prisoner, as I have previously noted, appears to have led a fairly sheltered private life until he began his liaison with the deceased. He seems to have been genuinely attached to her in his own way; but the available evidence suggests tht the relationship was in truth a mismatch. I am satisfied that during the course of the relationship the prisoner had, at least for much of the time, and to speak colloquially, a lot to put up with. 
    21   The prisoner expressed, from the very moment of the shooting, remorse for what he had done. I have seen video-taped evidence of such remorse and I did not get any impression that what I was seeing was insincere. I think that the prisoner is genuinely remorseful for what he did. 
    22   The prisoner’s history while in prison to date has some positive, and some troubling negative, features.  
    23   On the negative side, the prisoner has made an attempt on his life by slashing his wrists. He has received medical and psychological treatment to which he appears to have responded reasonably well. He is held in protection; in part, I should think, because of that history; but in part, as I understand the fact, because of threats made against him, although not actually to him, by another prisoner who has, it would seem, some connection with the deceased and her children. The prisoner does not know the name of this other inmate; but know only that he is serving a term in the order of 5 years for some robbery related offence(s). All of these factors will make the continuing imprisonment of the prisoner more than normally difficult, at least for the foreseeable future. 
    24   On the positive side, the prisoner appears to have made a real effort to improve his educational level and his vocational prospects. The relevant details are certified in the various documents comprising Exhibit 3 on sentence. These efforts of the prisoner are commendable, and I will give him proper credit for them. No doubt all those who are hereafter concerned with the prisoner’s management will give him all proper encouragement to continue his efforts. 
    25   I am satisfied that the prisoner is not a likely danger to the community and that personal deterrence, although a proper matter for consideration, does not play as large a part in his case as it might do in other and different cases. 
    26   I have found it no easy matter to bring into what I would regard as a proper overall balance the objective and subjective considerations that I have canvassed in my present remarks on sentence. Learned counsel for the prisoner referred me to a number of unreported decisions: Regina v Peter Paul Dundas: unreported, Studdert J, 15 April 1992; Regina v Whare Tuakana Gerrard: unreported, David Hunt CJ at CL, 3 July 1992; Regina v John Charles Edwards: CCA, unreported, 2 August 1995; Regina v Ismail Capar: unreported, Smart J, 27 October 1995; Regina v Wai Sung Cheung aka Steve Cheung: CCA, unreported, 11 December 1995; Regina v Koroneria Kingi: unreported, Hidden J, 18 December 1998. I have scanned them all; but I have found them to be, at best, of general indicative assistance. 
    27   I have come to the conclusion that a fair sentence would be an aggregate sentence of penal servitude for 16 years, divided between a minimum term of 12 years and an additional term of 4 years. 
    28   I have considered the matter of “special circumstances” of the kind contemplated by section 5(2) of the Sentencing Act, but I have decided not to alter the division as stated. There are two reasons for that. First, I am of the opinion that a minimum term, - that is, a time actually to be served , - of less than 12 years would not reflect adequately the seriousness of the point-blank and intentional shooting of the deceased. Secondly, I have not been persuaded by the available evidence that the proper rehabilitation of the prisoner back into the community after he has served that minimum term calls for a longer period of supervision than one of 4 years. 
     
      
     David Bradley Leonard: for the crime of the murder of Glenda Norris, you are convicted. You are sentenced to penal servitude for 16 years, divided between a minimum term of 12 years and an additional term of 4 years. The minimum term will commence on 12 October 1997 and expire on 11 October 2009. The additional term will commence on 12 October 2009 and expire on 11 October 2013. You will be eligible for parole on 11 October 2009. 
      
      
     I direct that a copy of these remarks on sentence be furnished forthwith to the Commissioner of Corrective Services; and I recommend that such copy remain with the prisoner’s Corrective Services file.

      R v DAVID JOHN PATRICK ZAMMIT 
      
      
     The appellant was convicted of murder and armed robbery. He was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for eighteen years and to an additional term of penal servitude for six years for the murder; and a concurrent fixed term of ten years penal servitude for the armed robbery.  
      
      
     He appealed against the conviction. Most of the grounds related to the trial judge’s directions concerning the issue of identification which was the central issue in the trial. The other two grounds related to the admission into evidence of photographs of the victim’s wounds; and an argument under s 6(1)  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
      that the verdict should be set aside as unreasonable or not supported, having regard to the evidence. 
      
      
     HELD 
      (dismissing appeal and confirming conviction and sentence): 
      
      
     Grounds 1-3: directions on identification evidence - leave granted but ground not made out 
      
     (1)  
     The need for appropriate directions as to dangers of identification evidence, which include a warning that there is a special need for caution, an explanation of the reasons for that caution, and an application of the warning to the facts, is well established, both under common law and as reflected in ss 116 and 165(1)

     (2)  
     The summing up was balanced, fair and comprehensive in relation to the identification evidence. The criticisms made could not be supported, when read fairly and in context.

     (3)  
     The role of trial Counsel to properly identify matters of complaint, and the advantages trial Counsel have over appeal Counsel, by reason of the greater familiarity of the trial, cannot be overlooked.

     (4)  
     Counsel have a positive obligation to raise matters of possible error, at risk of leave to raise points not taken at trial being refused (under r 4, Criminal Appeal Rules), absent error going to the root of proceedings or a real risk of miscarriage of justice.

     (5)  
     His Honour’s observations as to identification evidence being “requisite” were not so phrased as to suggest, as was submitted, that his Honour was discharging an obligation resting on him, merely as a matter of form, without lending his authority to the caution required.  
      
       
      
     (6)  
     It was entirely appropriate to isolate the evidence of the only two witnesses who made positive identifications, since their evidence alone could qualify as a direct identification. His Honour did no more than underline for the jury the need for special caution before accepting the evidence of these witnesses. 
      
       
     Pitkin

     Ground 4 - Participation in identification parade declined by appellant - leave refused under Rule 4  
      
     (7) No unfavourable inference could be drawn from the judge’s comments on the appellant’s refusal to participate in the parade. His Honour made it clear that refusal to participate did not imply guilt, and spelled out the reasons why this was so. There was no suggestion that the appellant acted inappropriately or that he should be regarded critically for doing so. 
      
      
     Ground 5 - Inference drawn from Gilbert & Sullivan passage quoted by judge - leave refused under Rule 4 
      
     (8) Directions to the effect that “you have got to be careful that you do not get any dust in your eyes” could not be understood as a suggestion that the appellant was trying to throw dust in the jury’s eyes. Its purpose was to encourage the jury to focus upon the central issues. 
      
      
     Ground 6 - directions concerning appellant’s unsworn statement - leave refused under Rule 4 
      
     (9) Judge’s direction to jury, to the effect that they were not allowed to draw an inference that the appellant was of bad character because in his statement he said that he had been in prison, at a time when one witness had claimed to have seen him, was entirely proper. It did not “risk planting in their minds” an impression that he was in fact of bad character. The direction did no more than head off any improper use of a matter raised by the appellant and to rule out the prohibited line of reasoning.  
      
      
     Grounds 7-8: directions in relation to response by witness tending to suggest that appellant was known to police 
      
     (10) The direction given was a sufficient response to the matter raised. It was clear that the jury were not entitled to assume, from the answer, that the appellant was adversely known to police. This case was not one where there was a high degree of need to discharge the jury by reason of the risk of unfairness.

     (11) Their purpose was to show how deliberate the action of the gunman was (going to state of mind), as well as to show how close his face must have been to the one identification witness when he leaned across that person into the car with the weapon in his hand In those circumstances their probative value was real, and exceeded any prejudice. 
      
      
     (12) The tender of selected photographs, as long as they have probative value, should be regarded as a step in the course of a trial in which violent death is patent for all. A degree of robustness must be extended and the sensitivity of jurors must not be overstated. The direction given by the judge was sufficient to maintain a proper balance.

     Regina v David John Patrick ZAMMIT 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted, at his trial in October 1997, of the murder of Toula Soravia. He was also convicted of armed robbery. He was sentenced to a minimum term of penal servitude for eighteen years, and to an additional term of penal servitude for six years in relation to the murder count; and to a concurrent fixed term of 10 years penal servitude for the offence of armed robbery. He has appealed against his conviction. An application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence was withdrawn.2 The offences of which the appellant was convicted occurred on 26 April 1994 at Summer Hill. They arose out of the shooting of Mrs. Soravia, in the course of the robbery from her of the takings of the BP service station, of which her husband, Loui Soravia, was the proprietor. The Crown Case3 It was the Crown case that before the shooting, one Steven Anas, a frequent visitor to the service station, discussed with a console operator, Hakki Souleyman, the money handling procedures, as well as the times when banking was done and the vehicles that were used to go to the bank. He also discussed with him the possibility of doing an armed robbery.4 Some two or three weeks before the offences, Souleyman said that Anas showed him a small black pistol. Within a week or so of the offences, he said, Anas asked him how much money was kept in the till. Although Souleyman had been convicted of being an accessory before the fact to the armed robbery, he denied when giving evidence at the appellant’s trial, that he had known that Anas was planning to rob the deceased, or that he had known or heard of the appellant before the offences.5 It was the Crown case that Anas and the appellant were friends and that they each frequented the business premises known as Instint Window Tinting. A vehicle used in connection with that business was a white two-door Toyota Corolla, registered No. SDO 359. It was this vehicle, or a vehicle of a similar make and colour that various witnesses said was used as a get away car by the person who shot Mrs. Soravia.6 The offences occurred between 11.00 and 11.30 am. after Mrs. Soravia and her son had left the service station in a motor vehicle with the takings of the business. Just as their vehicle pulled up outside the Westpac Bank in Lackey Street, a gunman, whom the Crown alleges was the appellant, leaned in through the passenger side window where the victim’s son Alex Soravia, was sitting. After making threatening movements with a small black pistol and making demands for money, demands which the victim resisted, the gunman placed the pistol against her cheek and pulled the trigger. The weapon discharged, filling the car with smoke. Mrs. Soravia died from the resulting head wounds. The gunman seized the bag containing the takings and ran across a car park towards Smith Street. The Crown alleged that he was subsequently picked up by the driver of the white Toyota Corolla.7 The appellant was arrested on 3 June 1994. He declined to participate in an ERISP or identification parade. He made no admissions as to his involvement in any offence, and nothing of an incriminatory nature was found upon a search of his premises.8 The Crown case depended, almost entirely, on the evidence of two witnesses who identified the appellant as the person involved in the shooting. The first was Alex Soravia, the son of the victim, who was in the motor vehicle, and on his account about 10cms. from the gunman when the fatal shot was fired. The second was Eugene Benitez. He gave evidence of being almost hit by a two door white sedan near Smith Street. He yelled out be careful. The passenger, who seemed to be fiddling with something, looked at him and swore.9 To these witnesses and another witness, James Roussos, I will return, since their evidence and the directions given concerning it, lie at the heart of this appeal.10 It is first convenient to note briefly the other evidence called in the trial touching on the identity of the gunman, and on matters potentially capable of providing a link between the appellant and the offence. In this regard it may be noted that the Crown case was essentially a direct evidence case. It was not a case that relied, other than incidentally, on circumstances that may have connected the appellant with the killing. It was, accordingly, not a matter that called for a circumstantial case direction. None was sought or given at the trial, and no complaint was made on appeal as to the absence of any such direction.11 The witnesses who gave evidence concerning the identification of the gunman, or of persons seen to be in the area of the bank on the day of the shooting (ie in Lackey, Smith, Short or Moonbie Streets, or in Hardie Avenue, or in the car park near the bank) other than the three witnesses already mentioned, were twenty-seven in number. Those witnesses fall into four categories: (a) Sightings before shooting12 James Kratuik from his place of work in Lackey Street saw two men sitting on a bench, at about 10am, one of whom left and the other of whom walked up and down the street before walking slowly towards the railway station. He described this man as being between 20 to 29 years old, 170cm to 175cms tall with a thin build, olive complexion, a week’s growth and dark brown curly hair. He was wearing dark sunglasses, with a string around his neck, a white T shirt with a black emblem, and black track pants. Mr. Kratuik assisted police in constructing a computer FACE image of this man. When, after the arrest of the appellant, he viewed the videotape compiled by police of photographs including one of the appellant, he was unable to make any positive identification. One of the three faces that he said was ‘similar’ was not that of the appellant.13 Yvonne Pomano saw two young men sitting on a bench in the carpark across from the Westpac Bank at about 9.30am, whom she described as being in their twenties and Mediterranean in appearance. One had a beard and one was shorter than the other man. They were wearing white T shirts, one of which had a blue motif, and blue jeans. By the time that she heard screaming, at around 11.30 am, in Lackey Street, the two men had left from the position where she had earlier seen them. The computer FACE images which she had seen published in the Daily Telegraph newspaper differed from the men she had seen.14 Azelda Townsend said that at about 11.25am. (a minute before the 000 call) she saw a Holden Commodore station wagon drive into Hardie Avenue from Smith Street, containing two males. The driver she described as between 25 and 35 years old, average height, olive complexion, Greek, Lebanese or Italian, black wavy hair to his collar, wearing black wrap around sunglasses and possibly a baseball cap. The passenger appeared shorter and younger, maybe between 18 to 30 years old. (b) Sightings at the time of the shooting15 Lucas van-Engelen whose statement was read, said that he had seen a man go up to the vehicle of the deceased, and place his head and arms inside it. He saw him holding a gun in his right hand and heard him ask “where’s the money, where’s the money?”. The woman began to scream. A short while later he heard the gun click. The man then ran into Hardie Avenue and across the carpark. The description of the man he gave was of a person 25 years old, 170 cm. tall, average build, brown coloured skin like a Mediterranean, and dark hair that was more black than brown. He was wearing a light grey top with a hood.16 Jane Williams said after hearing a cross between a scream and a cry, she looked back and saw people struggling in a vehicle. She saw a man lean into the vehicle from the passenger’s side, and then heard a noise like a car backfiring. That man then ran across the carpark waving his right arm in the air. She noticed someone commence to chase him. The first man she described as being around 20 to 25 years old, with a slim build and dark shoulder length wavy hair. He was wearing a loose fitting light coloured long sleeved shirt and sneakers.17 Mark Keegan said that from the intersection of Hardie Avenue and Lackey Street, he heard a man demanding money from the driver’s side of the deceased’s vehicle. The man he described as being 25 years old, 5 feet eight inches tall, maybe shorter, Arabic or Lebanese in appearance, with dark hair. The man pulled a little gun from the front of his pants, and shot the deceased. The noise was very soft like a cap gun. The man then ran through the car park. He thought that he was wearing running shoes. He did not recognise anybody in the police videos.18 Melanie Young, who was working in the newsagency opposite the Bank, heard screaming from outside the Bank. She saw a man leaning into the deceased’s car and then heard a bang. She said that the man who had been leaning into the car across the carpark in the direction of Smith Street. He was of medium height, non Anglo-Saxon appearance, with dark medium length hair. He was wearing a pale shirt and dark coloured jeans.19 Stephen Helper who was walking along Lackey Street, saw a man standing on the footpath beside the deceased’s vehicle and reach in through the passenger side window. He heard a shot and saw smoke. The man grabbed a light coloured bag from the vehicle and ran across the carpark. He was chased by someone. The first man he described as being of medium build, Mediterranean appearance, stubble on his face, possibly a moustache, and wavy dark hair down to the collar at the most. He was wearing a cream/bland coloured shirt and light coloured pants. He thought the man had a weather beaten face. He did not identify any person from the videotapes; nor did he recognise a photograph of a man identified to him by police as the suspect. (c) Sightings immediately after the shooting20 Frederick Barclay, whose statement was read, said that he was walking in Lackey Street, and heard a shot when he was about 50 metres from the bank. He saw a man pull away from the deceased’s vehicle and run towards the carpark with another man chasing him. That man he described as being in his mid-twenties, five feet ten inches tall, and with a medium build and dark hair down to his neck.21 Malcolm Young, who owned the newsagency, heard a scream and gunshot. He saw a man running through the carpark in Hardie Avenue towards Smith Street. He described this person as a male Caucasian, roughly 5 feet 10, with collar length dark hair. He thought him to be wearing a white shirt top and long dark pants.22 Belinda Grinham, who was an employee of the newsagency, heard a scream and bang outside. She saw a man run from the deceased’s car through the carpark. From behind, she said he looked to be around twenty-five years of age, to be of average build, and to be wearing a light coloured T shirt with dark pants.23 Richard Towe, who was sitting in the park adjacent to the Westpac Bank, heard a loud bang and someone call for help. He saw a man run through the carpark in the direction of Smith Street, chased by some other men. He joined in the chase for a while but stopped when he heard that the man was carrying a gun. He described the man as being medium height, fair sort of build, of Mediterranean appearance, slightly darker complexion with a couple of days’ facial growth, and short black collar length hair, which was a bit curly. He was wearing a white top and dark pants. He did not recognise anybody when shown the videotapes. He was reminded that when he made a statement to police he had said the man was wearing Reebok type running shoes.24 Valerie Wagstaff, who was walking through the carpark saw a young man run in front of her. He was 176 cm tall, skinny, with light brown to dark complexion, sort of like a moustache and sort of facial hair, and collar length black wavy hair. He held a little bag in his right hand.25 Patricia Sandas, who was also in the Westpac Bank, saw the back of a man running towards Smith Street. He was about 5 feet 8 inches with very thick longish black hair which was neither shoulder length or short. He was wearing a white top, dark trousers, and sneakers which could have been pink because they stood out.26 Julie Passas, who was similarly in the Westpac bank heard screams from outside. She saw a young man run across the carpark towards Smith Street. He appeared to be chased by another young man and two older men. She did not see his face, but described him as being 5 feet 7 or 8 inches tall, with a normal build, and hair that reached the top of his collar. He was wearing a white top, black tracksuit pants and joggers, with iridescent pink soles. He had something black in his right hand, like a bag.27 Sandra Ristway, who was in the Commonwealth Bank, also in Lackey Street, heard screaming. She saw a man run diagonally through the carpark from Lackey Street towards Smith Street. He was being chased by two other men, one young, the other older. She described the first man as possibly being Mediterranean, aboriginal, Filipino or South American, fine features, with dark skin and black wavy hair. He was wearing dark pants and something that looked like a tracksuit.28 Lisa Urquhart heard a bang and some screaming while parking her car in the carpark off Lackey Street, and then saw a man run from the street through the carpark. He was described as having a slim build, with dark hair that was a bit long. He was slightly taller than her at 166 cms, was wearing a white shirt and dark trousers, and was carrying a calico bank bag. She was shown a computer FACE image and said that it “looked similar” to the man.29 Paul Dyson, who was in premises in Smith Street, said that he saw a man run into that street from Hardie Avenue. He had dark skin, and was wearing longish dark shorts and running shoes with red soles. Another man was running behind him and they ran south into Moonbie Street. 30 Jon Yuen Lo, who was standing in front of his shop in Smith Street, heard the sound of people running. He saw a man run diagonally across that street into Short Street. He was followed by a light coloured four door car and another man. The second man stopped in the vicinity of the post office before turning back. The first man, he said, was 1.7 metres tall and of average build. The light coloured car followed him up Moonbie Street into Short Street.31 Ricky Patman, who had parked outside the real estate office in Lackey Street, heard a bang and someone yelling out “stop him, he’s got the money.” He then saw a man running through the carpark near the Westpac bank. He was 6 feet tall, with darkish skin like an Islander, and dark black hair. He was wearing a white coloured sloppy Joe and dark pants. He had a small black object in his hand. Patman drove his red Holden Camira up Smith Street and then into Moonbie Street. There was another passenger in his car. He saw a white two door Toyota Corolla in this street, the passenger door of which was closing as it pulled away. He attempted to follow it, but his pursuit was terminated when a garbage truck reversed into his path. He later identified the Toyota SDO 359 as the vehicle that he had pursued. 32 Anne Hagar, who was about 30 metres from the Moombie/Short Street intersection, saw two men run from Moonbie Street into Short Street. They got into a pale coloured sedan which sped off towards Ashfield. One man was described as being of medium height and build, either Greek or Italian, and wearing casual clothes. She also saw a pursuing red vehicle, which almost certainly was that of Mr Patman, containing two occupants.33 Janice Valenti saw several men running through the carpark in the direction of Smith Street. The first man she glimpsed from the side. She drove into Smith and Moonbie Street after him. She described him as being between 25 to 27 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches tall, with a slight build, unshaven facial hair, and collar length dark hair cut neatly around the face. He was wearing a pale grey hooded tracksuit type top and dark trousers.34 Anthony Mimica who was parked in Lackey Street heard someone screaming and saw a green car rolling backwards a little. He saw a couple of men running from that vehicle across into the carpark. He drove down into Smith Street. He continued a little further until he lost sight of the first man. He saw an older type white car take off quickly from the wrong side of the road, leaving a deal of smoke that obscured the number plate. He saw a red Holden Camira engaged in pursuit of the white car. He also joined in the pursuit until there was an incident with a garbage truck. He described the man who had run from the deceased’s vehicle as being 20 to 25 years old, with a slimmer build than his own, olive complexion, and dark hair which was as long as or a bit longer than his own. He was wearing a short sleeved top, long trousers, which may have been jeans, and runners.35 Dale Formosa, who was driving a truck into Hardie Avenue from Smith Street, saw a man run in front of his truck. That man was being chased by two other men. He also saw a white four door sedan (which he thought might have been an older model Toyota) driving very quickly with the rear offside passenger door in the process of being closed. There were two people in the car. The man he had earlier seen was described as being of medium build, European, with a dark complexion, quite a few days’ facial growth, a bony or undernourished face, a prominent jaw, shoulder length black hair which was neither really straight or really wavy. He was wearing a white T shirt and blue jeans and was holding two articles.36 William Martin, who was driving a bus in Prospect Road Summer Hill, noticed an early model white Toyota sedan speeding erratically towards Canterbury Road. It swerved around the back of a garbage truck that had reversed out of a laneway. He saw two men in the front seat, and someone lying on the back seat. The car noticeably hit a speed hump; the back of the exhaust system was at that point seen to be hanging down. The number plate he said included the letters SOD, and the numeral 1. The driver he described as being 26 to 27 years old, medium to solid build, olive complexion, Mediterranean appearance with a black moustache, an unshaven face, hairy arms and black curly brushed black collar length hair.37 David Wannacott and Dorothy Crisp each gave evidence of seeing a man running across the carpark after hearing a bang or screaming. The descriptions they gave were most probably those of James Roussos rather than the gunman.38 Joan Hutchinson, although not a witness at the scene, said that while waiting for a train at Central Railway Station she overhead one man in a group of three men, who had alighted from an arriving train, say “I didn’t expect her to fight back (or argue back) so I just shot her”. She said that the men were each about 20 years old, between five feet ten inches and six feet tall, and were dressed in scruffy casual attire. The Crown called this witness in discharge of its obligation to call all persons who may have been able to provide information of possible relevance. It did not, however, rely upon the evidence as advancing its case.39 The critical identification evidence came from the following three witnesses:40 Alexander Soravia made his observation of the gunman after he leaned across him into the front section of his mother’s vehicle. The entire incident he said lasted for about ten seconds, so that this may be taken to have been the extent of his observation. The gunman he described as being in his mid-twenties, thin build, Australian, with medium complexion and a three to four days’ growth on his face, some acne, and collar length wavy hair. He was wearing a grey sloppy-joe and something red around his neck. 41 On 6th June 1994, he made an identification from the video tape, in which he was “definite” that a picture of the appellant depicted the man who was the gunman. When shown, during his cross examination, the two computer FACE images compiled from the descriptions previously supplied by Messrs. Kratuick and Roussos, he said that he did not think those images resembled the gunman. He also said that he had been aware of the arrest of a man, in connection with the shooting, on 3 June 1994, from the television news. He had not, however, been made aware, before making his video identification, that any other person had identified the gunman to police.42 His father, Loui Soravia, gave evidence that he learned of the name of the person who had been arrested, from the news. He did not have any description of that man, and he specifically did not receive a description of him from Eugene Benitez, when the latter phoned to advise that he had identified someone connected with the shooting.43 Eugene Benitez His sighting of the passenger in the car, at the corner of Louisa and Smith Streets was from a distance of less than one metre. Its licence plate which he tried to memorise, he said was SDO 059. The description he gave was of a man with dark skin, one day old facial growth, near shoulder length hair which appeared to be plaited/braided. The man was wearing a grey/blue jumper with a coloured pattern at the side or front. In a statement made on 26 April 1994, he said that the passenger was cleanly shaven and wearing an ivory necklace. The driver was similarly described as having dark skin, with unevenly cut long hair, and was said to have been wearing mirror sunglasses and a white shirt.44 On 2 June 1994, he saw the videotapes and selected the photograph of the appellant as a photograph of the man whom he had seen riding as a passenger in the car. What he said was that the man photographed had hair which was different from that which he had seen on 26 April, but if one were to take the hair from another photograph that he selected, and place it upon the face of the first man, then one would have just what he remembered, or as he put it, “bingo”. 45 He had previously informed police that the computer FACE images were “no way near at all” although on other occasions he said they did resemble the occupants of the car. 46 He agreed that he had telephoned Loui Soravia, on the day following the arrest of the appellant, and had informed him that he had identified the person in the passenger seat, and that this person had been arrested. He conceded that he may have told Mr. Soravia that the appearance of the suspected gunman may have changed in relation to his hair. He had not mentioned his eyes, but he may have mentioned the colour of his skin.47 James Roussos, who was in the newsagency, when he heard the gunshot, ran out and applied the handbrake to the vehicle of the deceased as it was moving slowly backwards. He chased a man through the carpark, but terminated the chase when a bystander told him the man had a gun. By looking around the corner, he saw the man jump into the passenger side of a white two door Toyota sedan which was parked on the incorrect side of Short Street. It then sped off. He said that it appeared to have half of its number plate painted over (or concealed). That vehicle left in a westerly direction towards Strathfield. 48 He described the man he pursued as being 174 or 175 cms. tall with a medium to slim build, a middle eastern complexion, with a few days’ facial growth, high cheek bones, hollow cheeked appearance and dark black curlyish hair to his shoulders. He was wearing a sloppy joe with a hood, and sandshoes with red soles. Mr. Roussos said that he had seen this man loitering near the real estate agency fifteen minutes before the shooting, when he had entered and left those premises. He believed that he had also seen him in Newtown from one to two months up to three to four months, earlier. 49 On 6 June 1994, he selected the picture of the appellant from the video, as a person having “a similarity” to the man he had chased. He assisted in the preparation of the FACE images, which he thought resulted in a 70 to 75 per cent likeness.50 The other evidence that was called, to place the critical identification evidence into context, may be briefly summarised:51 Ballistic and physical evidence was led from Sergeant North, and Detective Senior Constable Riviere to the effect that the entry wound to the face of the deceased was consistent with it being occasioned by a small to medium calibre projectile, into which category would fit a .25 calibre projectile, a cartridge case of that calibre having been found on the floor of the deceased’s vehicle after the shooting.52 Evidence was led concerning the recovery of a small white Toyota Corolla registration number SDO 359, that was observed on 27 April, to have been left in a street in St Peters. Its rear number plate was creased between the numerals 5 and 9, and a pool of oil was seen to be lying on the road surface. According to Department of Motor Transport records, the plates had been earlier handed in and not re-issued. Inside the vehicle were found an Instint Window Tinting business card. It was also found that the 0-rings securing the exhaust system had been dislodged. The only identifiable fingerprints obtained from the vehicle or its contents were those of one Martin Sanchez and Maria Kiely, a friend of Sanchez. No blood or gunshot residue was found.53 Evidence was led linking this vehicle with the Instint Window Tinting business, and with other persons of possible interest, as follows:54 The committal evidence of Mr. Quinteros, the owner of Instint Window Tinting, was read. He said that when he left the workshop on Saturday 23 April, a white two door Toyota Corolla with a registration number including the letters SDO and the numeral 9, was there, amongst other vehicles. It was not there when he returned on the morning of 26th April, but he did notice a motorbike belonging to Steve Anas parked on the footpath. He also saw Martin Sanchez, an employee of his at Instint Window Tinting who had been out helping a client, return just after 11.00am. An argument ensued and Sanchez left in a Toyota Seca. He returned after lunch. In the meantime, Anas and the appellant arrived at the premises between 12.30pm and 1.00pm.55 Jerry Aposhian said that he called in to Instint Window Tinting just before midday. A few minutes later, Anas and the appellant arrived and began whispering with Quinteros. They stayed at the workshop for about an hour.56 Martin Sanchez said that the white Toyota Corolla was used by him in relation to the Instint Window Tinting business. It had many problems including oil leaks and an exhaust system that was prone to falling off. He had not, however, noticed any damage to the rear number plate before 26th April.57 He said that he saw the appellant at Instint window Tinting on the night of 25th April, and again on the following morning. He had tried to use the Toyota Corolla that morning himself but found that it would not start. He left in another vehicle to see Maria Kiely before returning temporarily at about 10am., by which time Anas’ motorbike had not yet arrived. When he returned at about midday he saw Quinteros, the appellant, Anas and Aposhian. He said that he had not seen the Toyota Corolla since that morning. Quinteros informed him that it had broken down. 58 In an audiotape of an intercepted conversation between him and Maria Kiely he was recorded asking her whether she had heard about the car being found, and observed that his fingerprints were on it, that he would be asked who had used it last, and that he was not allowed to say. In his evidence he said that what he had meant was that he did not know who had used it last.59 Maria Kiely gave evidence that she spent the morning of the shooting with Sanchez.60 Some additional evidence was called in relation to Anas’ possible involvement in the offence, including the fact that during a search of his home, on 28 April, 1994 a grey sloppy joe with red piping on the neck, a pair of pink soled running shoes and mirror sunglasses with an attached cord, were found. Anas left Australia for Greece on 20 May 1994, without being arrested. He had earlier been interviewed by police. Attempts to extradite him to face trial on this matter had been unsuccessful.61 Some evidence was called as to the appearance of the appellant and other possible suspects at the time of the offences. Carole Walcott, the appellant’s probation officer, said that she had seen him on 20 April and 27 April 1994, at which times his hair was very dark black in colour and short shoulder length. She also said that she had called at his home at about midday or 1.00pm. on 26th April, and had been informed by his mother that she had just missed him.62 Mr. Souleyman described Anas as having receding hair and a beard. Quinteros he described as being very skinny, five feet nine inches tall, with a thin face, a couple of days’ facial growth and long curly hair. The Case for the Appellant63 The appellant made an unsworn statement in which he said that he had attended Instint Window Tinting on 25th April to discuss money owed to him by Quinteros. He remained at his home on the morning of 26 April, during which period he spoke with his mother, a couple who lived across the road (Andrew Rice and Melissa Borland) and with another neighbour, Jackie Loveridge. He left home at around 1.30pm. or 2.00pm. after receiving a phone call from Michael Atsis. He spent the remainder of the afternoon at the Atsis’ home, before being driven home by the son-in-law of Michael Atsis. 64 He said that he had been in prison during the period when Mr. Roussos claimed to have seen him in the Newtown area. He also said that he had a scar on his face, and a tattoo on his wrist. He was always clean shaven and he kept his hair neat and tidy. 65 Ms Loveridge gave evidence of seeing and talking to the appellant in the street near her home at about 11.5 to 11.20am. He was wearing a T shirt and shorts, he was clean shaven and his hair was cut neatly, to the level of his ear. It was established that she had a criminal history for offences of stealing and dishonesty. 66 Andrew Rice gave evidence of seeing the appellant standing at his gate after 11.00am., wearing a loose shirt, shorts and thongs. He was similarly shown to have a criminal record involving offences of embezzlement and misleading police. Neither his sister nor Melissa Borland, who were with him, had any memory of seeing the appellant that morning.67 The appellant’s mother said that she had seen him on separate occasions during the morning 26th April before he left the house, well after 1.30pm, following a phone call from Michael Atsis. She said that Ms Walcott had called at the home after he had left.68 There was agreement that Michael Atsis had declined to speak to police and was not an available witness. It was similarly agreed that the parents of the appellant had declined to be interviewed or to supply a statement in relation to the alibi offered by him. Grounds 1 to 369 Each of these grounds relates to deficiencies submitted to have existed in the directions given concerning the identification evidence. They can be conveniently dealt with together.70 In essence it was argued that the jury were invited to convict the appellant on the evidence of Alex Soravia and Mr. Benitez, without sufficient attention being given to the extent to which the evidence of the remaining witnesses, in particular Mr. Roussos, cast doubt on the prosecution case; and without sufficiently drawing to attention the dangers inherent in identification evidence, particularly as they related to this case.71 In order to deal with these grounds it is necessary to examine the manner in which His Honour approached the question of identification. The specific complaints need to be understood in the context of the summing up as a whole, and not by reference to isolated passages or expressions. What must be garnered is the message, and the warnings that were effectively conveyed to the jury, in order to determine whether the issues were fairly stated, and those dangers of which they may have been unaware properly brought home to them.72 It can be noted at the outset, that his Honour took a great deal of care in dealing with this aspect, which clearly was the primary issue in the trial. The jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the person who was seen to fire the fatal shot, and to run from the scene, was the appellant. There was no sufficient case against him absent acceptance of the evidence of his identification as that man. 73 His Honour began with the observation: “As you are well aware from the content of those addresses, the critical identification witnesses in this case are Alexander Soravia and Eugene Benitez. They are the two persons who positively identify this accused.”74 Although some criticism was offered of this passage, on the ground that it conveyed an impression that his Honour believed that their evidence amounted to a positive link of the appellant to the gunman, that is to unduly strain the language used. I am in no doubt that all his Honour intended to do, and all that the jury understood him to be doing, was to refer to the circumstance that they had selected photographs of the appellant from the videotapes as the gunman. 75 His Honour then accurately and comprehensively summarised the evidence that they could give, of the events they described, and of the subsequent identification procedure undertaken with the police. No complaint was made at the trial concerning the sufficiency of this summation of the evidence. Nor could any criticism have fairly been made of it. That Mr. Soravia’s identification was unequivocal is indicated by his answer when shown the video picture of the appellant: “Yes that’s the one I saw. There’s no doubt whatsoever. I could never be more definite of anything in my entire life. That photo of the man in 11 is the man that took my mother’s life, that is the fact that I will live with until the day I die.”76 Mr. Benitez’ identification was no less positive in so far as he described the picture selected as “bingo” but for the hair.77 Before going on to give detailed directions concerning identification evidence, and to relate the relevant matters of caution to this case, his Honour observed: “I have dealt with these identification witnesses because as I said to you at the commencement of these directions, as was foreshadowed to you there are certain matters of law pertaining to identification evidence upon which I am required to give you directions. Important amongst those directions are those to which I now turn concerning identification evidence. 
     
      
       
        As I have said to you many times now, the real issue in this case is just that, namely identification of the accused. If you conclude that there is any reasonable possibility that he is not the offender then he must be found not guilty. It is only if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he is the offender that there can be a verdict of guilt.” 
       
      
    78 His Honour next briefly referred to some of the matters that the Crown relied upon as supportive of the identification evidence, so far as it might link the appellant with the other persons mentioned as having some association with Instint Window Tinting and with the Toyota Corolla. 79 He then came back to the three key witnesses, and mentioned that of them, Alex Soravia and Benitez gave evidence of separately identifying the appellant from the selection of twenty photographs on the video. James Roussos, his Honour said, “did not positively identify the accused” from the video - that witness his Honour observed, said that the photo number 14 (the appellant) “did bear some resemblance” to the man he had chased. His Honour added that none of the other witnesses who gave descriptions “claimed to positively identify” the appellant. His Honour then said, in a passage which was the subject of complaint:  “I am giving you these directions not only because it is requisite that I do so, but in recognition that you may accept the evidence of positive identification by Alexander Soravia or by Eugene Benitez or by them both and you could convict on that evidence alone. You could not, I expect you understand, convict upon the evidence of James Roussos which did not in itself amount to identification. He simply said it bore some resemblance to the person whom he had seen. I have to inform you and I do that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence and I add that that exhortation for caution is given because it is appropriate to warn you that such evidence may be unreliable. Having said that I should elaborate and explain to you the reasons for the need for that caution.”80 It was submitted that this passage amounted to an invitation or advice by his Honour to the jury that they could accept that Alex Soravia and Mr. Benitez had positively identified the appellant, and that they could safely convict him on the evidence of either of them, without regard to the remainder of the evidence. 81 Again this is to place a tortured interpretation on the paragraph. I am satisfied that, by this passage, his Honour did no more than underline for the jury the need for special caution before accepting the evidence of Alex Soravia or of Mr. Benitez in the light of the warnings that were to follow; and, favourably to the appellant, to inform the jury as was correct in law, (Pitkin (1995) 69 ALJR 612) that Mr. Roussos’ evidence that the video photo bore “some resemblance” to the person he chased, did not amount to an identification. 82 It was also submitted that his Honour, in explaining that he was giving the direction because it was “requisite” that he do so, flagged that it was of a routine nature, and could be treated somewhat dismissively. No such interpretation is in my view fairly open, taking the passage alone, and certainly not in the light of what followed.83 His Honour specifically and comprehensively thereafter dealt with each of the relevant areas that may affect the reliability of an identification, and in each instance applied them to the relevant evidence.84 So it was that this Honour said: “As a matter of history it has been known there are cases where an identification has been the vital issue and mistakes have been made. The tragedy of such an occurrence needs no emphasis from me. You may have known that is the case but I confirm to you the experience of history. 
     
      
       
        I am not limiting the situation to a case of a witness who is making a false accusation. An honest witness may make a mistake. A number of honest witnesses may all make the same mistake and this may happen quite independently of each other.” 
        
       A little later his Honour added on this topic: 
        
        “I was saying that honest witnesses may make a mistake. Indeed we have no doubt made mistakes in identification at some time in our lives. People may have common features that we notice and we may find ourselves deceived by what we focused on might lead us to some error. This is one of the reasons why there is a special need for caution in identification evidence.” 
       
      
    85 His Honour then dealt with the defence submission concerning the possibility of contamination of Alex Soravia’s evidence, arising through any news broadcast that he may have seen over the weekend preceding his video identification which contained a sketch of the person arrested. This was put into context by the following direction. “If you think he may have (seen such a broadcast) you should be cautious about accepting an identification which may be so contaminated by the suggestion that the sketch could offer.  
     
      
       
        Consciously or unconsciously an identifier may seek a match with something he had seen rather than the image from memory and that is a danger of which you should be aware.” 
       
      
    86 It was further placed into context by reference to the fact that Alexander Soravia could not remember whether he had seen the broadcast. In these circumstances, the direction given was a sufficient warning. It did not call for any greater weight, particularly in view of the witness’s uncertainty as to whether he had actually seen the news item.87 His Honour next dealt with a number of other factors that he said “may affect the reliability of identification evidence”.88 The first, being one of obvious application to the present case, was explained as follows: “A factor which may affect the reliability of identification evidence is the extent of the witness’s acquaintance with the accused. It is obviously much easier to be mistaken as to the identity of a total stranger than to be mistaken as to the identity of a close friend.”89 His Honour pointed out that neither Alexander Soravia nor Mr. Benitez had ever seen the offender before. 90 Then followed an observation which became the subject of complaint, upon appeal, but not at trial, in the following terms: “Neither had Mr. Roussos, unless you think it is possible that the man he had seen in Newtown on the occasions between December and February, who could not have been the accused, was the offender. Indeed if you came to that conclusion you would have to find the accused not guilty.”91 This observation, it was submitted, operated unfairly to the defence case since it was, perhaps unintentionally, dismissive of Mr. Roussos’ evidence that he had previously seen the offender in Newtown, at a time when the appellant could not have been in that suburb. Again this involves a tortured reading of the passage. It was not an unqualified assertion that Mr. Roussos had never seen the appellant before. Moreover, fairly to the appellant, it underlined to the jury that if they thought it that was a possibility that he had done so, then they had to acquit. The observation needed to be understood in the light of the important direction extracted earlier, given when his Honour first turned to this subject, to the effect that if the jury concluded that there was any reasonable possibility that the appellant was not the offender, then he had to be acquitted.92 The next factor that his Honour mentioned was the opportunity which the witnesses had to make their observations. This was related to each of the witnesses, in the course of which reference was also made to matters such as panic, and to the dramatic circumstances that confronted them, which may have affected the reliability of their impression. This included a reference to the fact that Alex Soravia was in a situation of stress and distress when he made his observation, and that he had ten seconds to do so; that Mr. Benitez’s observation was made in a “split second;” and that Mr. Roussos’ observations were made during a chase.93 Next, his Honour turned to the terms of the descriptions that the witnesses respectively gave and their consistency with each other, and with the video picture of the appellant. In the course of this discussion, he invited attention to whether or not the photograph shown was a good enough likeness of the appellant and whether or not it was so different from the others as to stand out and invite selection.94 His Honour then went on to discuss the phenomenon known as displacement, in the course of which he underlined the importance of the first identification.95 The next factors discussed were those of delay between the initial sightings and the video identifications; of suggestibility or tainting, through the witnesses having seen the sketch, or otherwise having had some suggestion put to them; and of the expectation, generated by the fact that police had asked them to look at the videos, that they might see the suspect. Again these warnings were related to the witnesses to whom they were apposite.96 His Honour next observed that he was not mentioning circumstances such as the lighting at the time that the original sightings were made because it was broad daylight. He did, however, instruct the jury that it was necessary that they take into consideration the distance the people were away from the man that they claimed to see.97 Having identified the recognised factors that can affect the reliability of an identification, and related them to the present case, his Honour went on to deal with the three key witnesses in the following terms: “I remind you that it is only in their evidence, that is evidence of Alexander Soravia and Eugene Benitez that you have a positive assertion of identification. Before you act on the evidence of either or both of them you should pay careful attention to the dangers which I have sought to draw to your attention Whether you come to the conclusion that despite those dangers and precautions as you accept and are prepared to act on the evidence of either of them is a matter for you.  
     
      
       
        I remind you I am not expressing any view about it. I am not saying identification is always wrong nor am I saying it is always right. I am not making any comment one way or other in this case. What I am saying is before you find the accused guilty you should look very closely at the evidence because of the dangers which exist in convicting on such evidence where reliability is disputed. 
        
        I have already mentioned to you the evidence of James Roussos but he does not positively identify the accused. A particular weakness in his evidence is his testimony that the man he had seen a couple of times earlier in Lackey Street and the man he chased was the same man that he had seen on several occasions in the Newtown area at times when you know it couldn’t have been the accused. It is a matter for you but you might think it is  
       quite dangerous to place any weight on Mr. Roussos’ remark that the picture he saw looked similar to the man he chased 
       , but that is a matter entirely for you, but you might think it considerably weakened by the manifest error that he must have made about the man being the man he chased unless, of course, you think he was right in which case it was not the accused who was the offender, then he is inevitably to be acquitted. So that you might think that the most prudent course is to set aside the evidence of Mr. Roussos in that regard, but as I say it is a matter for you.” 
       
      
    98 His Honour came back to this matter, towards the end of the summing up, when he said, in response to a point raised by defence Counsel, that Mr. Roussos had said that there were two occasions when he had seen the man he had chased on 26 April: “You remember, members of the jury, I said to you you might think there is a particular weakness I should draw attention to the evidence of Mr. Roussos and that is that we know that insofar as he said that the man he chased was the same man he had seen in Newtown on a few occasions and was also the man he had seen on a couple of prior occasions on 26 April, two things would seem possibly to follow. One, if he is correct, you know it was not the accused because he told you he was in gaol at the time;  and if it was the man seen in Newtown and earlier that day and it was not the accused, clearly the accused would have to be found not guilty. The alternative I was putting to you is that if you were not satisfied that it was the man he had seen in Newtown, that would make any suggestion of his that the face looked similar to the one he picked somewhat weakened, because you know that Mr. Roussos is a person capable of making a mistake about in very matter. (sic) 
     
      
       
        So that I was suggesting to you that you might consider placing Mr. Roussos’s identification evidence rather to one side. In fact putting the matter bluntly, although it is a matter entirely for you,  
       although the Crown said to you on many occasions you have two and a half identifications, you might think it is more prudent to look at the two identifications and put the half to one side 
       , and that is what I was really suggesting to you. Does that cover it? No? 
        
        BODOR: No I don’t think so. I think what your Honour is saying to the jury is they should put Mr. Roussos aside. 
        
        HIS HONOUR: No. I have said if they think that Mr Roussos is correct and the man he was chasing was the man seen in Newtown, then it wasn’t the accused and that is the end of the trial as far as the accused is concerned, he must be acquitted. I have now said so three times.” 
       
      
    99 The observations concerning Mr. Roussos in these passages were the subject of particular complaint in the appeal. It was recognised that his Honour intended his remarks as operating favourably to the appellant, and as constituting a strong warning to the jury not to treat this witness’s evidence as a further identification (i.e. as a “half identification”) of him. However, it was submitted, they risked being regarded as dismissive of the witness generally, and as a consequence, of no assistance to the defence submission that he may well have correctly identified, as the gunman, someone who could not have been the appellant. Moreover, it was submitted that the penultimate sentence invited a reversal of the onus of proof.100 Similarly, understood in context, and read fairly, I am in no doubt that the intention of his Honour was as suggested, and that the jury would have understood the direction accordingly - ie as a direction not to use the evidence of Mr. Roussos, as a positive identification of the appellant. I am not persuaded that the passage would have been understood as inviting the jury to disregard his evidence so far as it might have assisted the defence case, or as operating to reverse the onus of proof.101 On the contrary, it underlined the circumstance that the jury might think it possible that he had correctly identified, as the gunman, a person who was not the accused - a situation which his Honour made clear would require a not guilty verdict. That is a natural reading of the words employed. In the light of the observations which went before, it was the message which I am satisfied the jury received.102 The “regard” in which his Honour said that it might be ‘most prudent” to set aside Mr. Roussos’ evidence was that which related to an “identification” of the appellant, and not that which related to a possible identification of some person other than the appellant.103 A further complaint was made to the effect that his Honour did not sufficiently bring to the attention of the jury the evidence of the remaining eyewitnesses. In particular this concerned those aspects of the descriptions that they gave of the man they saw either at the scene of the shooting, or running away from it, that did not fit the appellant. This submission is not made good. 104 In fact his Honour took great pains to refer to the evidence of the remaining witnesses (at pages 37 to 66 of the summing up). Appropriately, in doing so his Honour adverted to the possibility that some of them might have been mistaken, and for example might have described Mr. Roussos rather than the appellant. He also made reference to the problems that some witnesses can have in articulating an adequate oral description. 105 Fairly, to the Crown and to the defence, his Honour said in this regard: “You are well aware without my adverting to it, there are variations to some extent in the descriptions. Of course from your own experience you will know that people, including ourselves, probably may well be able to recognise somebody although quite unable to put their tongue around an adequate oral description. These various witnesses were apparently each in their individual way attempting that exercise of articulating what they claim to have seen. It is a matter for the use of your individual experiences of life to look at all this material and decide whether or not as the Crown contends it is supportive of its cases or whether it does not support its case, or whether as is put on behalf of the accused the variations are such as to entail in your assessment a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused.”106 In dealing with these witnesses, his Honour expressly made reference to those who attempted unsuccessfully to identify the appellant from the videos (e.g. Mrs. Crisp, and Messrs Helper, Towe and Kratuik), the failure of Mr. Helper to identify him when shown a single photograph accompanied by advice that the police considered him to be a suspect, and the statement by one witness (Mr. Kratuik) that a person other than the appellant bore some similarity to the offender. 107 What was significant about the evidence of these witnesses, however, was the common theme in the descriptions given, none of the detail of which could be said to have excluded the appellant, and a great deal of which was consistent with his appearance and particularly his build.108 His Honour did not say, as Counsel at the appeal submitted he should have said, that their evidence was capable of positively supporting the appellant’s innocence. In my view, such a statement would have overstated the effect of the evidence, to the point of error. A non identification in the circumstances of the case, did not amount to a positive exclusion of the appellant, as the argument seemed to suggest.109 It was made perfectly clear in the summing up that absent the evidence of Alex Soravia and Mr. Benitez, the descriptions given by the remaining witnesses would not have been enough to support a conviction. Their evidence was placed before the jury so that they might properly assess the evidence of the key witnesses, and so that the material available to the Crown was presented warts and all. It is not a fair analysis of the summing up, when read in full, that the evidence of Messrs. Soravia and Benitez was unduly elevated by comparison with that of the other witnesses.110 A further matter floated at the trial, and repeated on appeal, was the possibility that Mr. Benitez’ phone call to Loui Soravia, had somehow tainted the video identification made by Alexander Soravia. This possibility never arose above mere speculation. There was simply no evidentiary basis for the supposition, let alone the conclusion, that any information concerning the appearance of the man identified by Mr. Benitez, was given to Loui Soravia, and then communicated to Alex Soravia. None of those witnesses accepted that it did, and the photographs were presented in a different numbered sequence to Messrs. Benitez and Soravia respectively. 111 The factor of suggestion, arising from an expectation of identification, was the subject of an express warning, and there is no reason to suppose that the jury overlooked it. Moreover, his Honour fairly put the argument advanced at the trial as well as the evidence concerning this aspect, even though, in my judgment, it was speculative at best.112 Next, it was submitted that it would have been important to emphasise the possible significance of the evidence of Det. Breton concerning Alex Soravia’s reaction that the FACE images reproduced in the Daily Telegraph article looked something similar to the gunman, a proposition with which Mr. Soravia did not agree at the trial. Again the jury were reminded of this evidence. It did not call for any more specific direction.113 A matter potentially of greater significance was the circumstance that a pair of sneakers, with pink soles of the kind said by some of the witnesses to have been worn by the gunman (e.g. Sandas and Patas), were found on a search of the premises of Steve Anas, and were admitted by him to be his. A pair of sunglasses with an attached cord, of the kind some of the witnesses mentioned seeing, was also found during this search. These matters were, however, sufficiently mentioned in the summing up.114 The final specific matter which was drawn to attention on the appeal, was the submission that strong comment was required in relation to the manner in which Mr. Benitez’ identification occurred. His initial reaction when seeing the picture of the appellant was that he was “pretty sure.” It progressed to being definite (“Bingo, he is the man”) when the hair on the person depicted in another photo was transposed to that of the appellant. The need for a strong comment, it was submitted, was increased by the circumstance that his sighting was of a man whom he saw for a few moments, and who was a passenger in a moving motor vehicle; and by the further fact that he gave conflicting responses to the accuracy of the FACE images that were reproduced in the Daily Telegraph article.115 These were matters properly to be taken into account, but the risks of misidentification concerned were, to my mind, sufficiently pointed out in the general directions, and in the specific directions that were given in relation to this witness.116 The matters identified above were the subject of grounds 1 and 2, and to a substantial degree they overlapped, being concerned with submissions to the effect that the directions given in relation to the identification evidence were inaccurate or misleading, or failed sufficiently to identify weaknesses or inconsistencies in that evidence. Ground 3 was somewhat more comprehensive and was not confined to the summing up, it being submitted that his Honour failed generally to warn the jury as to the dangers involved in identification evidence. 117 The need for appropriate directions as to those dangers, which included a warning that there is a special need for caution, and an explanation of the reasons for that caution as well as an application of the warning to the facts of any given case is well established. It is reflected in SS 116, and 165(1) of the Evidence Act 1995, as well as in the decisions in Alexander (1981) 145 CLR 395, Domican (1992) 173 CLR 555, Bruno (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 7 July 1997) and Clarke (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 31 October 1997).118 The complaint made in this regard essentially involved a submission that the observations made, during the course of the evidence, and later in the summing up, concerning the topic of identification, were so phrased as to suggest that his Honour was discharging an obligation resting upon him, merely as a matter of form, without lending his authority to the caution required. 119 In particular this was said to arise from the statement that he was “merely discharging” a duty that rested upon him as a Judge in drawing relevant matters to attention. It was also said to arise from an observation, in the summing up, along the lines that he was “in a sense, indirectly inviting the jury consideration to the precautions” to which he planned to turn when dealing with the identification witnesses; and from the observation, relevant to the witnesses Soravia, Benitez and Roussos, that he was giving the directions not only because it was “requisite” that he do so, but also in recognition that the jury may accept the evidence of identification by Soravia and by Benitez, or by them both, and convict on that evidence alone. 120 When the passages identified are read in full, however, it can be seen that the submission concerning the asserted failure of his Honour to lend his own weight to the caution, is totally misconceived. 121 A detailed direction on identification evidence was given at the conclusion of Mr. Soravia’s evidence, an important stage of the trial which no doubt led his Honour to open the subject with the jury. It needs to be extracted in full, since once it is read in context it becomes immediately obvious how groundless this submission is. His Honour said: “Members of the jury, at the end of the trial I indicated to you last week it will be my duty to give you certain directions of law. One of the matters I would need to speak to you about at the end of the trial is identification evidence. As you were told at the very outset of these proceedings, a critical issue for you to determine will be whether or not you accept beyond reasonable doubt that this accused David Zammit was the killer of Mrs Soravia. 
     
      
       
        I am not at present seeking to comment upon Alex Soravia’s evidence directly, in the sense that I am not suggesting to you that you would accept it or not. Clearly in the end if will be your task to decide whether or not you were satisfied on all of the evidence, that the accused has been appropriately identified. However, I am required to give you a caution which I would need to repeat at the end of the proceedings that there is a special need for caution on the part of the jury before accepting identification evidence. 
        
        I repeat, I am not making any suggestion to you one way or the other but I am bringing to your attention the need for special caution. These observations are made by Judges because it is generally accepted that the experience of Courts ought to be shared with persons such as yourselves who may be brought on one occasion to make determinations about a matter such as identification. 
        
        These observations occurred to me as things that I should draw to your attention in that context. You would have understood that a witness making an identification may be honest and accurate but may be wrong. This may have happened to you or to me. I repeat, I am not suggesting to you whether the evidence of Alex Soravia is right or wrong. That is one of the matters you would have to deliberate upon. I am merely telling you that you should understand the precautions I am giving to you. You would take into account, in weighing the evidence of the shortness of opportunity and the circumstance in which the identification was made. 
        
        As I expect is obvious to you, it would appear that Alex Soravia is quite confident of his identification and as I say it will be for you in substance to come to a conclusion as to whether he is correct or not, on the whole of the evidence in this case, including his testimony. But you will take into account the opportunity and the circumstances in which observations could be made. 
        
        You would bear in mind a stranger is being identified: That is, a person who you do not know. You might in your own experience of life realise that you recognise, for example a member of your family, quite easily. But somebody you saw for a brief time you might not recognise so easily. In other words depending upon the circumstance and the dramatic nature of the occasion, it may have indelibly impressed upon you. I am not suggesting one way or the other. I am merely drawing to your attention some matters that you should take into account in your assessment. 
        
        You know that the identification about which evidence has been given took place after the viewing of a video and you would take into account after the arrest, there may  
       not 
        (sic) be some expectation that a person, at least thought by police, to have been responsible for this crime, would be on the video tape. 
        
        On the other hand as the evidence is before you Alex Soravia said he was merely brought into the room and, although he expected he might be undertaking some sort of identification process, he was merely told to look at all these pictures once and then to stop the policeman if there was something that had triggered his attention. 
        
        It is of course a matter for you what assessment you make, if you accept that evidence or you deny it. Once again I say nothing I said to you about this is intended to hint to you that I have any view one way or the other about this matter. I am merely discharging, amongst other things, a statutory obligation for every Judge, where identification evidence has been admitted, to inform the jury that there is a special need for caution before you accept that identification evidence, and I should speak to you about the reasons for that caution; that is what I have been doing in the context of the remarks I make to you at the moment. I do it now, for two reasons: One, because you are well aware in the beginning and until the end of this case, identification is a central issue that you will be called upon to determine and I should say to you what I have said here and now, whilst the evidence is fresh in your memory that that is not intended to either enhance it, or depreciate it. 
        
        I am merely discharging my duty in drawing these matters to your attention. The reason is, in your absence I would have been asked so to do. So it seemed to me reasonable to respond to that request. What I have said to you, you should bear in mind through the case, this need for caution. At the end of the trial I will need to repeat what I said to you perhaps in more elaborate terms, having regard to what other evidence, if any, emerges in the course of the trial. 
        
        I do not think I shall delay matters any further. I draw those matters to your attention. I say it for the last occasion now; I am not making any comment one way or the other but I am certainly not seeking to influence you one way or the other, except to the extent I am telling you there is a need for caution when you are dealing with identification matters. You may well appreciate that without my saying so but it is thought by the law, and by Parliament, that a Judge in these circumstances should have something along the lines of what I said to you, to so say.” 
       
      
    122 The word “not” italicised above may reflect a transcription error, or a slip of the tongue. If the latter, it is clear from the context that it would not have caused any misunderstanding.123 The reference to the “indirect invitation” in the summing up needs to be read in the context that it related to the group of witnesses who were in the general vicinity of the shooting, and who gave oral descriptions of the man they had seen. What his Honour said in this regard was: “I am, in a sense, indirectly inviting you to give consideration to the precautions to which I will turn in relation to that group of witnesses, but I remind you that no one of them, that is the people in and about Lackey Street and so forth, with the exception of the three I return to, purports to directly identify this accused.”124 The “three” were Soravia, Benitez and Roussos. When read fairly this was an entirely appropriate direction, which was favourable to the appellant, in that it underlined the fact that even though none of this “group” gave evidence that amounted to a direct identification, it was still necessary to apply the caution to so much of the oral descriptions they provided as might point to the appellant.125 I turn next to the passage in which his Honour made reference to giving the directions not only because it was “requisite” that he do so, but also because of the recognition that the jury might accept the evidence of Messrs. Soravia and/or Benitez. This passage needs similarly to be understood in its full context. It is set out earlier in these reasons (para 79).126 I am quite unable to accept the argument that the reference to the direction being “requisite” suggests that it was given as a matter of form, and not because it was considered to be appropriate; or that his Honour was dissociating himself from the warning. The contrary message appears to me to have been conveyed, particularly having regard to the fact that his Honour said that the “exhortation for caution” was given because “it was appropriate” for a warning to be given that the evidence may be unreliable. 127 So far from being inappropriate and dangerous to isolate the evidence of Messrs. Soravia and Benitez, as was submitted, it seems to me entirely appropriate for his Honour to have done so, since it was only their evidence that could qualify as having involved a direct identification from the video, in accordance with the principles discussed in Pitkin. 128 The final submission made in this regard is that his Honour overstated the position in favour of the Crown, in so far as this passage made mention of a “recognition that you (the jury) may accept the evidence of positive identification by Alexander Soravia and by Eugene Benitez or by them both and you could convict on that evidence alone”. This cannot be fairly read, as Counsel submitted on the appeal, as a direction that, as a matter of law, the jury could convict on the evidence of Mr. Benitez alone. 129 Obviously, more was required, as the jury had first to find that the person Benitez saw in the car was the man whom the other witnesses saw running from the deceased’s vehicle after the fatal shot was fired. That was obviously the case, and it was made clear by the observation two paragraphs later which was in the following terms: “Eugene Benitez says it was definitely the accused. Again I say that as a comprehensive way of pointing to the conclusion that if you accept the evidence that the killer was the passenger in the get-away car then it was that passenger that Eugene Benitez identified.” 
     
      
       
       This flagged unequivocally for the jury that his identification depended upon the jury finding that the passenger he saw was the person who had fired the fatal shot and had then run from the vehicle of the deceased.  
       
      
    130 As I have observed previously, the appellant was represented by very experienced Senior Counsel at the trial, who saw no fault with the directions. What has been attempted here is a trawling through of the summing up for isolated passages, which simply do not support the criticisms now sought to be raised, when read fairly and in context. This Court has firmly discouraged any such practice: Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183; Bollen (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 25 March 1998) and PAH (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 18 December 1998131 The role of trial Counsel to properly identify matters of complaint, and the advantages that such Counsel possesses over Counsel called in for an appeal, by reason of his or her greater familiarity with the climate and nuances of the trial, cannot be overlooked. As Hayne J observed in HG (1999) HCA 2, the trial and verdict are “not merely stopping places on the path to appeal”. See also Sharman v Evans (1976-7) 138 CLR 563 at 565. 132 Counsel have a positive obligation to raise matters of possible error: Checconi (1988)34 A Crim R 160 at 162; Nelson (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 23 May 1996) at risk of the leave required by r 4, Criminal Appeal Rules to raise points not taken at trial, being refused, absent error going to the root of the proceedings or a real risk of a miscarriage of justice being shown: Tripodina and Cooke (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 24 August 1998).133 I am satisfied in this case that the summing up was balanced, fair and comprehensive, so far as it dealt with the central issue of identification. No error going to the root of the proceedings was shown nor was there any risk of a miscarriage of justice arising in relation to it. Having regard to its relevance to ground 12, and to the fact that detailed argument was heard in relation to the matter, I would grant leave but find that this ground was not made out. Ground 4 - Identification parade declined134 The appellant submitted that, in the manner in which his Honour dealt with the refusal of the appellant to participate in an identification parade, an inference unfavourable to his case was invited. What his Honour said in this regard needs to be read in full. It was as follows: “It is the evidence, and it is unchallenged evidence, that the accused declined to participate in an identification parade. He cannot be forced against his will to participate and it is his legal right not to do so. He is not to be penalised for exercising his rights. It is no different in substance from the situation with which I am sure you are familiar by now that when the police were interviewing suspects or persons even in this case they commenced by saying “You do not have to answer any questions unless you wish but if you do so” and so forth. The important thing about that caution, as it is called, is they are saying you do not have to answer questions. If somebody declines to answer they are merely taking up the offer and it is not to be held against him. They are exercising their legal right. So it is if asked to participate in an identification parade a person may exercise their legal right not to participate in that and may not be penalised with that. When that happens as it has in this case, where an accused declined to participate in an identification parade he can hardly complain about one not being held. His refusal to participate does not prove he is guilty. You must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he is the same person who committed the offences before you would be entitled to convict.”135 The particular complaint made has two aspects. First, it was submitted that the reference to the non-availability of “force” to compel participation, carried with it the suggestion that this was the reason the appellant declined to participate in an identification parade, and that notwithstanding his right to take that course, he ought not to have taken it. Secondly, it was submitted that, linking the concepts of refusal to participate and guilt, in the penultimate sentence, ran into the very danger which needed to be avoided. 136 This submission fails. It invites a tortuous and wholly artificial interpretation of the direction which, fairly for the appellant, made it clear that his refusal to participate in the identification parade did not imply, and could not be used as an admission of guilt, and spelled out the reasons why that was so. Nowhere was there any suggestion that the appellant acted inappropriately in exercising his right, or that he should be regarded critically for doing so. I would refuse leave under r4 to argue this ground, which was not taken at the trial. Ground 5 137 This ground related to an observation made by his Honour towards the end of the summary of the evidence called in the Crown case, which drew upon a line from “Iolanthe”. The passage was in the following terms: “Some of you may be familiar with the Judge’s song from Gilbert & Sullivan where he sings that he will “never throw dust in a juryman’s eye, said I to myself said I”. What I am saying to you is that you have got to be careful that you do not get any dust in your eyes. I am not suggesting that anybody has been throwing it at you. What I am suggesting and emphasising to you is that you keep your focus upon what you and I have sworn here to do, namely try the issues raised by the indictment and it may well be that you think that some witnesses have been less than candid or that there are things that you don’t know but they only become relevant if they touch upon your judgment upon the essential issue.”138 It was submitted that as this observation was made shortly before his Honour turned to a summary of the defence case, and immediately before his Honour reminded the jury of the appellant’s response when confronted with the allegation that he had been party to the murder, it risked being understood as a suggestion that the appellant was trying to throw dust in their eyes. Further, it was submitted that the words were capable of being regarded by the jury as an exhortation to be persuaded by the prosecution case of identification by the two key witnesses, and to ignore the conflicting evidence and submissions of the defence.139 This submission is baseless. A fair reading of the passage invites the contrary of the message suggested. Its purpose was to encourage the jury to focus on the central issue, and it was said in the context of the Crown case, and in particular in the context of the observations made by his Honour in relation to the Instint Window Tinting witnesses. 140 Moreover, before his Honour dealt with the exchange between police and the appellant, he flagged that he was moving on to a new topic by the words “Can I turn from saying these things to mention some matters about the evidence given by police officers”. Several matters were then dealt with before his Honour came to the defence case. 141 There is no sound reason for supposing that the jury carried over to that segment of the summing up, some impression that his Honour had implicitly warned them to beware that the defence was throwing dust in their eyes. Indeed, his Honour expressly said that he was doing no such thing. Trial Counsel saw no danger in the observation. I see none and I would refuse leave under r.4 to argue this ground. Ground 6142 In the course of his unsworn statement, the appellant said that he had been in gaol when the Newtown sightings by Mr. Roussos allegedly occurred, and as a consequence he could not have been the man Mr. Roussos saw. His Honour gave the jury a direction concerning this portion of his statement, in the following terms: “There is a matter arising out of the accused’s statement that I should make the subject of particular reference to you. You have heard the accused tell you that he was in gaol. Now there is a danger about which I must warn you and that is the danger that such evidence will set off in your mind the following prohibited line of reasoning: 
     
      
       
        ‘The accused has been in gaol and is a person of bad character. Crimes are more often committed by the bad than the good; therefore the accused is likely to be guilty of the crime with which he is charged.’ 
        
         
          I should tell you, a jury is never permitted to use such knowledge for the purpose of concluding that an accused person is guilty of the crime with which he is charged simply because he is the sort of person who would be likely to commit a crime. As I say, that is a prohibited line of reasoning and my firm direction to you is that you must not allow it to enter your deliberations.” 
         
        
       
      
    143 It was submitted that this direction gave rise to a risk of a miscarriage of Justice in that it was suggestive of a line of reasoning which might not otherwise have occurred to the jury, and risked planting in their minds an impression that the appellant was in fact a person of bad character. Once again, this involves a tortured reading of the passage. Moreover, it ignores the ability of the jury to think for itself. Almost certainly the appellant’s disclosure of having been in gaol, irrespective of the reason for it, drew their attention to the possibility that he was a person of bad character. The direction did no more than head off, for his benefit, any improper use of a matter that had been raised by him and to rule out the line of reasoning that is prohibited. It has become customary in other areas requiring warnings, to give some explanation of the reason for the direction. To do so gives it content, and makes it understandable, thereby overcoming the risk that it will be dismissed as a bare piece of advice.144 Trial Counsel saw no problem with the direction. I see none. On the contrary, the direction was a fair and proper direction directed to redressing any risk that the disclosure may have been used inappropriately. I would refuse leave under r.4 to rely on this ground. Grounds 7 and 8145 These grounds relate to a response that the witness Benitez gave to a question in the course of his evidence in chief. It emerged somewhat unexpectedly, and without encouragement on the part of the Crown Prosecutor, in the course of the following question and answer: “Q. When you watched the video what did you see? 
     
      
       
        A. A series of videos, of I suppose, criminals.” 
       
      
    146 Counsel sought a discharge of the jury in their absence, at the next adjournment, on the basis that the answer compounded the suggestion, otherwise available from the fact that an identification procedure was undertaken, that the appellant was known to the police. The application was refused, upon the basis that any unfairness could be redressed by a suitably firm direction to the jury. 147 In that regard, it was proper for his Honour to consider, in the light of the matter complained of, the atmosphere of the trial, and any direction that could be given, whether it was necessary to discharge the jury in the interests of ensuring a fair trial. In weighing up that matter, it was appropriate for his Honour to take into account the circumstance that the photographs used were not the traditional “mug shots”, and that the evidence later to be led would show that they came from the police information unit.148 The direction given was in the following terms: “Members of the jury, before we resume this morning there is one matter I might say something to you about. You might recall late yesterday afternoon Mr. Benitez was asked a question about watching the video that was shown to him by police and he said he saw ‘a series of videos of, I suppose, criminals’. I should say something to you about this. The police when they need to put together a series of people who look similar have many sources upon which they can draw and Mr. Benitez’s supposition is not necessarily correct. One thing that it is important I should speak to you about is the circumstance that will emerge in due course and that is one of the photographs, and I think you will get evidence there were 20 on the series, was that of the accused. It is common ground in this case that before the photographs were shown Mr. Zammit was one of a number of suspects and there are many ways that the police have of getting photographs of people and no inference should be drawn by you that he was previously adversely known to the police simply because they had his photograph. There are many sources from which police can get photographs. Mr. Benitez told you what he supposed and I am merely saying to you that he can suppose if he wishes but you shouldn’t draw any undue inference for the reasons I have explained to you.”149 There was no complaint in relation to this direction, and it was in my view a sufficient response to the matter raised. In particular, it was made clear to the jury that they were not entitled to assume, from the answer, that the appellant was adversely known to police. There is no reason to suppose that thereafter, in a lengthy trial, in which careful and detailed directions on identification were given, that the chance observation of the witness retained any significance, or that the jury ignored the direction given. In any event, later in his own statement, the appellant disclosed circumstances that inevitably indicated that he had been known to police.150 The case was not one, in my view, where there was the high degree of need to discharge the jury by reason of the risk of unfairness contemplated in Knape (1965) VR 469 or in Vaitas (1981) 4 A Crim R 238. 151 For these reasons I am unpersuaded that the discretion miscarried, or that this ground has been made good. Grounds 9 and 10152 These grounds were abandoned. Ground 11153 This ground relates to the admission into evidence, over objection, of two photographs of the victim, the prejudicial effect of which, it was submitted, outweighed their probative value. The photographs tendered were close ups of the wound to the left cheek of the deceased. They were not the more graphic photographs of the kind taken during post mortem forensic examination, in respect of which a discretion commonly needs to be exercised to ensure that they do have a probative value which exceeds the prejudicial effect of any emotional reaction they might engender.154 Their purpose was to show how deliberate the action of the gunman was, a matter going to proof of his state of mind, as well as to show how close his face must have been to Alexander Soravia when he leaned into the car with the weapon in his hand.155 In those circumstances, they had a probative value which was real, and which exceeded any prejudice which if it arose at all, from these two photographs was to my mind insignificant. 156 The sensitivity of jurors to photographs can too easily be overstated. I can see no reason why a degree of robustness should not be extended in this regard. Nor can I see why the tender of selected photographs, so long as they have a probative value, (O’Sullivan and Mackie (1975) 13 SASR 68 at 74/75) should be regarded as other than another step in the course of a trial in which the fact of violent death is patent for all: Green  (1939) 61 CLR 167 at 172; Jeffrey (1967) VR 467 at 473 and Ames (1964-5) NSWR 1489. 157 The direction which his Honour gave was sufficient to maintain a proper balance. It was as follows: “HIS HONOUR : Members of the jury, the issue in this case as you have known from the very outset is whether or not the Crown can prove that the accused was the perpetrator of the killing and the robbery, therefore you should look at the photographs in a calm deliberate and dispassionate fashion. I have ruled that it is appropriate that you should see these photographs in order that you make the determination in the context of the reality of what happened, but you should bear in mind that you shouldn’t use any emotion -.”158 There is no reason to suppose that the jury failed to take account of this direction. Moreover, the case was not one in which a large number of graphic photographs were tendered solely for their emotional effect or prejudicial value. Accordingly, I am of the view that the exercise of discretion did not miscarry. This ground has not been made out. Ground 12159 Under this ground the appellant addressed an argument under S 6(1) Criminal Appeal Act to the effect that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable, or could not be supported, having regard to the evidence. The relevant test for this ground is that stated in M (1994) 181 CLR 487 and Jones (1997) 191 CLR 439, namely whether this Court, after its own independent assessment of the nature and quality of the evidence, reaches the conclusion that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant.160 In undertaking this exercise it is appropriate for the Court to respect the advantage that the jury, which is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, had in seeing and hearing the evidence, (Chidiac at 443-4, 453 and 462) and M at 493, where that is capable of resolving any doubt experienced by the Court. Otherwise, as was said in M at 494: “Where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the Court will be one which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.”161 The matters said to lead to this result were as follows: 
     
      
       
       (i) the conflicts and weaknesses that it was submitted existed in the identification evidence; 
        
       (ii) the evidence of the identification witnesses particularly Mr. Roussos, which it was submitted, positively indicated that the appellant was not the offender; 
        
       (iii) the alibi evidence; 
        
       (iv) the offer by Anas of an allegedly “false alibi” to the effect that his motorbike remained outside the Instint Window Tinting premises on the day of the shooting, and that he received a parking ticket for the bike that morning. 
       
      
    162 I am not persuaded, after an independent assessment of the evidence, that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt. 163 In dealing with this ground of appeal it is proper to take into account that the accused did not give sworn evidence: Blade (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales 1 May 1991).164 More importantly, however, there was a core consistency in the descriptions given which did not exclude the appellant as the gunman, and positive identification evidence by two persons, one of whom was best placed of all to observe, and have impressed in his mind, the facial features of the gunman. Neither was shaken, and the jury were well placed to assess their demeanour and credibility.165 Furthermore, the appellant was a person who the Crown was able to show had some association with events that could be linked to the offences. The jury were entitled to find beyond reasonable doubt that the Toyota Corolla which normally was left at the premises of Instint Window Tinting was the get away vehicle. The jury were also entitled to find that it was the vehicle to which the gunman returned. Not only were there eyewitnesses to the route he took, but there were physical links to the vehicle, including the fact that it went missing on the day of the robbery from Instint Window Tinting where Anas and the appellant were seen. Additionally, several witnesses at the scene recalled sufficient of its licence plate letters and numerals, or noticed physical signs in relation to the exhaust pipe and tampering with the part of the licence plate as to provide a positive match. 166 Anas was a man with whom the appellant associated, and he had made inquiries of the console operator at the service station before the shooting and robbery, which were highly incriminatory.167 Although these other circumstances would have been insufficient to support a case against the appellant, without the identification evidence, they provided some general support for the Crown case. In particular they excluded an argument that the appellant was a person for whom no possible connection with any aspect of the offence could be shown, or that his identification was wholly a matter of chance.168 The jury were also entitled to reject the alibi evidence offered on his behalf, in view of the criminal antecedents of his alibi witnesses; the wholly unremarkable events that they purported to recall associated with this day; the inability of some of the persons said by the neighbour (Andrew Rice) to have been in his company, to recall seeing him; the evidence of the appellant’s probation officer, which did not fit in with the appellant’s evidence as to his departure from his home at 1.30pm; and the evidence of the persons associated with Instint Window Tinting who placed him at those premises during the morning. If this evidence was rejected as constituting a false alibi, as the jury were entitled to do, then it served to strengthen the Crown case.169 Finally, the “alibi” of Anas concerning the presence of the motorbike outside Instint Window Tinting was of little probative value so far as the defence case was concerned. It said nothing as to Anas’ location, let alone the location of the appellant at the critical time. In any event the appellant could not derive any assistance from a false alibi (if it were such) offered by a suspect co-offender, or by his flight, (if that was what his departure for Greece was), in circumstances where the Crown case was, that there were two persons involved in the crimes charged, of whom one was Anas.170 The first leg of this submission is, accordingly, not made good.171 It was also submitted that the case was one that attracted S 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act by reason of the asserted errors or inadequacies in the summing up, by reason of an unprompted “in court” identification by the witness Keegan when he referred to the hair of the man he saw at the scene as being “longer than it is now,” and by reason of Benitez’ observation that he “supposed” the pictures shown to him on the video were those of criminals.172 The so called in Court identification depended upon a single chance remark, which was equally capable of being understood as nothing more than a statement that the hair of the man he saw on the day of the shooting was longer than that of the appellant as he appeared in Court. The evidence fell far short of an in Court identification, and no risk of a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by it. The remaining matters have already been dealt with, and for the reasons earlier expressed, I am unpersuaded that this aspect of the submission has been made good. 173 Accordingly, I would propose that the appeal be dismissed and that the conviction and sentence be confirmed.

     WOOD CJ at CL BARR J GREG JAMES J Tuesday, 1 June 1999 
     
     REGINA v Alan James CRAMPTON 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    2   BARR J: The appellant appeals against a conviction entered in the District Court following his trial by jury. He was charged with two counts of committing an act of indecency with a boy named Neil Douglas McAlister, one count of indecently assaulting him and two counts of indecently assaulting a second boy, David John Lansley. The appellant was convicted of the first count but the jury were unable to agree about the others. 
     
      
    3   The appellant was a school teacher who taught children with learning disabilities. The complainants were two of his pupils. 
     
      
    4   The first count concerned an incident in which the appellant masturbated himself in the presence of Mr McAlister. 
     
      
    5   The second count concerned an incident in which the appellant was said to have exposed his erect penis to Mr McAlister and placed a plastic object over it. Mr Lansley also was present. 
     
      
    6   The basis of the third count was an incident in which the appellant was said to have required Mr McAlister to masturbate him. Mr Lansley also was present. 
     
      
    7   The fourth count asserted that the appellant exposed his penis to Mr Lansley, required him to expose his penis and touched his penis. Mr McAlister also was present. 
     
      
    8   The final count asserted that the appellant rubbed himself against Mr Lansley and handled his penis. Mr McAlister also was present. 
     
      
    9   According to the complainants, the events relied on for the first, second, fourth and fifth counts took place in a storeroom which led off the classroom in which the appellant taught his pupils.  
     
      
    10   The incident the subject of the first count happened after the appellant called Mr McAlister from the classroom to the storeroom and closed the storeroom door. After the incident was over, Mr McAlister returned to the classroom and continued with the lesson as normal. The second incident happened when the appellant called Mr McAlister and Mr Lansley into the storeroom and closed the door behind the three of them. After the act of indecency that then took place, Mr McAlister and Mr Lansley ran out of the storeroom into the classroom. 
     
      
    11   Although the evidence was not entirely clear, it appears that there was a class in progress at the time of each of the alleged incidents relied on for the four counts I have mentioned. 
     
      
    12   The appellant gave evidence and denied the acts alleged. He said that when he used the storeroom he never closed the door. 
     
      
    13   The school attended by the complainants was a normal primary school, but the class of which they were members was specially set up in 1978 to teach selected pupils who had learning difficulties. 
     
      
    14   Judging by a photograph which was received into evidence, there were thirteen pupils in the class. 
     
      
    15   The various acts of the appellant were said to have taken place within various periods of time particularised in the indictment, the earliest of which began on 1 March 1978 and the last of which ended on 31 December 1979. However, it became apparent during the trial that the appellant did not teach either of the complainants after 1978 and that if any incident happened it must have been during that year. 
     
      
    16   Mr McAlister made no complaint until 1997. As a result of what he then said, Mr Lansley was approached by the police and it was not until after that event that he made any complaint. 
     
      
    17   The failure of the complainants to complain for a long time resulted in a trial which commenced about twenty years after the alleged events. The appellant was thereby deprived of a significant opportunity to have his solicitor make proper enquiries into the facts and prepare a defence. An issue arose at the trial whether the appellant ever closed the storeroom door while a class was in progress. If the event relied on by the Crown for the second count took place and Mr McAlister and Mr Lansley ran out of the storeroom into the class, that was a matter about which pupils might have had some recollection if approached within a reasonable time thereafter. Again, if it never happened, the lack of recollection might have assisted the appellant, since it was a matter likely to be remembered if true. Opportunities to enquire into matters like these were lost after twenty years. 
     
      
    18   Three members of the class were called to give evidence. It is not necessary to deal with the detail of it and sufficient to say that none remembered any matter of significance. Those three were presumably the only members of the class who could be identified and traced. 
     
      
    19   The first ground of appeal complained about the manner in which the trial judge directed the jury about the failure of the complainants to complain. Her Honour directed the jury that the failure of either complainant to complain might be considered as suggesting that he should be disbelieved and that that was a matter that they had to consider carefully. Her Honour told the jury that the failure to complain did not necessarily indicate that the events related did not happen and dealt with the reasons why young boys like these complainants might not complain. 
     
      
    20   Her Honour then dealt with the resulting disadvantage to the appellant, referring to failure of memory and loss of opportunity to gather evidence in his defence. 
     
      
    21   It was submitted that these directions were inadequate because the jury were not also told that by reason of those disadvantages they should exercise caution and scrutinise the evidence of the complainants with great care. Reference was made to R v Johnston Court of Criminal Appeal 31 July 1998 unreported; Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79; Jones v The Queen (1997) 149 ALR 598 and R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12. 
     
      
    22   Of course, nothing in the cases cited requires a trial judge to use any particular form of words to bring home to the jury the need for caution and careful examination of the evidence, and the question raised by the first ground is whether her Honour, looking at the whole of the summing up, effectively did so. 
     
      
    23   Because the complainants were members of the special class her Honour gave the jury this special warning - 
     
      
       
        
        You are brought into this court as members of the community to apply your knowledge and commonsense about life; about the way people are and how they might recount events, particularly events of a long time ago; how accurate or inaccurate you might expect people to be in their recollection of events. Really, memory has several aspects does it not? First of all it is how well observation was made at the time the events occurred. You have to look in the context of a situation like this, at the fact that the complainants were children at the time and the view children have of events a the time they occur. You have to look at their capacity to retain those events, the is, were the events of a nature that they would tend to stay in the memory and have done so. You have to look at their capacity to recount them. These assessments always must be made in the context of the experience and capacities of a particular witness. For example, both the complainants here were in a class for slow learners … It is a matter for your assessment but you may not think them particularly sophisticated as adults or particularly articulate. You are going to look carefully at the evidence they gave, each of them individually, at the evidence they gave both in chief and under cross-examination. 
        
       
      
    24   Her Honour told the jury that the evidence of each complainant was vital. At the commencement of the summing up her Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
        It is also opportune at this point to remind you that the vital evidence in this trial is the evidence of the two complainants. That is, of Neil McAllister and David Lansley. It is, of course, now a little time since you heard from them, so that in making an assessment of their evidence it will be necessary for you to take yourselves back and think about the impression that each of those young men made upon you in the witness box when they gave their evidence. Because it is on the evidence of each of them individually, looking individually at the counts relating to them, that you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
      
    25   Her Honour elsewhere told the jury that they could not find the appellant guilty of any count concerning Mr McAlister unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr McAlister’s evidence was essentially reliable. 
     
      
    26   A peculiar feature of the trial was that although in his evidence about the second and third counts Mr McAlister said that Mr Lansley was present, no evidence was adduced from Mr Lansley about those events. Similarly, Mr McAlister gave no evidence about the events giving rise to the fourth and fifth counts, notwithstanding that Mr Lansley said that he was present. As a consequence, her Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
        As is common in cases of sexual misconduct there is no corroboration. Each of the two complainants g[a]ve evidence that the other was present on a particular occasion by you will be aware that they were not asked about their presence on those particular occasions. The Crown is relying in each case on the evidence of the particular complainant. It does not seek to rely upon the other complainant to give supporting evidence. So that you are left with, and have the evidence of the recollection of the particular complainant in relation to the particular count without any supporting evidence or corroboration from the other complainant, even where that other complainant is said to have been present. So it brings you back to being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt only on the evidence of the particular complainant. 
        
       
      
    27   Even so, it was submitted, it was not enough that the jury were told, in whatever words should be used, to be careful about relying on the evidence of Mr McAlister. They should also have been told at the same time that they were being given that warning because of the difficulties the delay had given the appellant in preparing his defence. 
     
      
    28   Whilst it is correct to say that the direction about the need to look carefully at the evidence of the complainants was separated from the direction explaining how delay had produced difficulties for the appellant, I do not think that it follows that the jury would not have understood that delay and its consequences were a reason for them to be careful. The principal passages to which I have referred appear in four consecutive pages of the transcript of her Honour’s summing up, so the two relevant concepts were dealt with closely in time. 
     
      
    29   This was a compact summing up that contained several appropriate warnings. It seems to me that the combination of observations, directions and warnings was sufficient in the context of the trial to give the jury a firm understanding that they were obliged to consider very carefully the evidence of each complainant and why. Looking at the summing up over all, I think that it was fair. 
     
      
    30   I think that this ground of appeal should fail. 
     
      
    31   The second ground of appeal asserts that her Honour failed properly to direct the jury about inferences that they might have drawn from the failure of the Crown Prosecutor to ask Mr Lansley about the events which Mr McAlister had described and which formed the basis of the second count. Mr McAlister had told the jury that when he placed the object over his penis he described it as a “dick stretcher”. 
     
      
    32   Her Honour gave the jury the direction which I have set out above to the effect that neither complainant corroborated the other. 
     
      
    33   It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the jury were entitled to infer that if Mr Lansley had been asked about the events the subject of the second count, any evidence he might have given would not have assisted the Crown. It was further submitted that the jury would have been entitled to infer that Mr Lansley had not simply forgotten the incident, so striking were the facts. 
     
      
    34   It was submitted that the directions in fact given by her Honour would have left the jury with the impression that there was nothing surprising about the failure of the Crown to ask Mr Lansley about the matter and that the Crown had decided not to call evidence which it could have called. 
     
      
    35   As appears from what I have already said, the jury were repeatedly told that Mr Lansley’s evidence did not support Mr McAlister’s. In the circumstances it is difficult to know how the jury could have used the additional direction contended for if it had been given. Indeed, counsel for the appellant in this court had difficulty formulating the directions that he contended might have been appropriate in the light of the relevant authorities. The inference, supposing the jury decided to draw it, would have been of no more assistance to the appellant than the fact, which the jury knew, that Mr Lansley’s evidence did not assist the Crown on the second count. 
     
      
    36   There is no reason in my opinion for supposing that the jury would, because of the directions given, have thought that the Crown did have evidence but had decided not to call it. The jury knew that they had to decide the matter on the evidence before them. 
     
      
    37   In my opinion the additional direction contended for was unnecessary, and this ground of appeal should fail. 
     
      
    38   The final ground of appeal complains that the trial judge, in directing the jury to look at each count separately, failed to direct them that they were entitled to take into account in considering any count any reasonable doubt that they entertained in respect of any other count relating to the same complainant. 
     
      
    39   Her Honour told the jury a number of times that they had to deal separately with the counts, for example - 
     
      
       
        
        … it is on the evidence of each of them individually, looking individually at the counts relating to them, that you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. 
         
        The other matter which I want to emphasise at this stage is the fact that there are really five separate counts. Five separate trials. It is important that you look at each of these matters separately. You could not, for example, go to the first count, look at the facts relating to that first count and say, “We are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty of that count and accordingly therefore he must be guilty of all the others”. You cannot do that. You must take the facts which relate to each complaint and to each separate issue and deal with those separately. 
        
       
      
    40   It was submitted that these and other directions were inadequate and that it was also necessary to make clear to the jury that they were not required to consider each count completely separately from the other counts and that they ought to have been directed that if they had a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant in relation to one count, they were entitled to take into account that doubt and its implications for the credibility of the complainant concerned when considering any other count relating to the same complainant. 
     
      
    41   No such direction was requested at the trial, and the appellant needs leave to argue this ground. 
     
      
    42   Trial counsel for the appellant swore an affidavit, which was read on the appeal, stating that it was not for any tactical reason that the direction was not asked for. 
     
      
    43   It seems to me that if such a direction had been given it would have been necessary, in order to secure a fair trial for the Crown, to balance it with a direction dealing with the consequences for other counts concerning either complainant of a finding of guilt on any count concerning that complainant. Such a direction would have had to be made with some care, of course, particularly to avoid cutting across the direction her Honour gave warning the jury that they must not engage in propensity reasoning. 
     
      
    44   I doubt whether two such additional directions would have materially improved matters for the appellant, and they would have made a clear summing up more complicated. 
     
      
    45   In dealing with directions requiring a jury to deal separately with each of several counts in an indictment, Gleeson CJ said in R v Mitchell, Court of Criminal Appeal 5 April 1995 unreported - 
     
      
       
        
        The directions given about considering the charges separately and returning separate verdicts are standard directions given in any case where there is more than one charge against an accused person. They are not inconsistent with the possibility that in reaching their separate verdicts the jury may consider the totality of the evidence in the case as relevant to each charge. 
        
       
      
    46   I would refuse leave to appeal on this ground. 
     
      
    47   I would dismiss the appeal.

     2  
     HIDDEN J 
     : The applicant, Reginald George Roberts, awaits trial in the District Court on charges of publishing a false statement with intent to obtain money (s178BB of the  
     Crimes Act  
     1900) and stealing a motor vehicle (s154AA). He applied for a permanent stay of the proceedings before Backhouse DCJ, who refused the application. He seeks leave to appeal against that decision, pursuant to s5F of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act  
     1912. 
      
     3  
     The first charge alleges that in September 1990 at Nowra the applicant made a false insurance claim on the basis that a Kenworth truck had been stolen, when in fact it had not. The second charge alleges that he stole a Commodore sedan at Lithgow in February 1992. The Crown case is founded primarily upon evidence that in mid-1994 a Kenworth truck and a Commodore sedan were found in the possession of the applicant at premises in South Australia. It is alleged that the truck is the same vehicle which the applicant had claimed was stolen in 1990, and the Commodore is the vehicle which was stolen in 1992. For those propositions the Crown relies upon expert evidence. 
      
     4  
     Both vehicles were examined by Constable Peter McKenzie of the South Australia Police Technical Services Branch, whose training included the examination of motor vehicles. As to the Kenworth truck, he found that the engine number on the Caterpillar engine had been obliterated, as had the chassis number on the front right chassis rail. When he examined the identification plate (or compliance plate) attached to the right-hand side fire wall, he found that an attempt had been made to remove the chassis number originally stamped on that plate and another number had been stamped over it. 
      
     5  
     He removed the identification plate from the vehicle for microscopic examination. He was able to determine that the chassis number originally stamped on the plate was 406382, which proved to be the chassis number of the vehicle which the applicant had reported as stolen. Also found at the applicant’s premises in 1994 was a set of steel marking stamps for the impression of numbers onto metal, and the constable was able to report that several of those stamps had been used to insert the false chassis number on the identification plate. 
      
     6  
     As to the Commodore sedan, he found that the original compliance and vehicle identification plates had been removed and plates from a similar model vehicle had been attached. The engine number on the left side of the engine block had been obliterated and the chassis number, located on the top left side of the dashboard behind the front windscreen, had been concealed or removed. However, he was able to find a vehicle identification number on a broadcast sheet under the carpet on the passenger’s side and also behind the front left headlight. That number, 503029, was found to belong to the vehicle stolen at Lithgow. 
      
     7  
     In an initial report, Constable McKenzie noted that both vehicles had been reported stolen and recommended that they be retained. Nevertheless, they were disposed of later in 1994 and, inexplicably, it appears that neither of them can now be traced. It is primarily this fact which gave rise to the application for a permanent stay. Evidence was led before Backhouse DCJ of the process of identification of a Kenworth truck, to which I now turn. I shall deal with the Commodore sedan later. 
      
     8  
     Mr Alan Stead, National Service Manager of Kenworth Trucks, gave evidence. He explained that the company’s trucks are custom built and that most of their components, including, for example, transmission and axles, have their own serial numbers. For each truck comprehensive documentation setting out its components, known as a “bill of material”, is prepared, and the company keeps microfiche records of them. He said that, to identify a particular vehicle, one would have to check not only the chassis number and engine number but also the serial numbers of all the major components.  
      
     9  
     He saw the chassis number as a very important reference, describing it as “our bible”. However, he explained that, if the chassis number were discernible only from the identification plate, it would not provide reliable identification of the vehicle as the plate could have been removed from another truck. We received in evidence the transcript of Constable McKenzie’s evidence at the committal proceedings, although it is not clear whether this material was before her Honour. There, the constable had said that his identification of the truck was entirely dependent upon the identification plate, and the plate appeared to have been riveted on to the fire wall after the new numbers had been punched onto it. Of course, this does not necessarily mean that the plate had come from another truck: it could have been removed from that truck and been replaced after the attempt to alter the chassis number. 
      
     10  
     Mr Stead went on to explain that the various component parts could be transferred from one truck to another. As he put it, “Kenworth trucks are a meccano set, anything can be changed around on it”. Hence the need to check all the parts bearing serial numbers to ensure a reliable identification of a vehicle. Her Honour also had an affidavit of Mr Raymond Cool, who was experienced in the recovery and repossession of trucks over a lengthy period. That affidavit was not before us, but its effect was summarised in her Honour’s reasons in this way:  
      
      In effect he stated the only way to identify a truck is to examine the totality of it; every item taken together identifies the truck. …It is too simplistic to look at major components. 
      
     11  
     Accordingly, argued counsel for the applicant, Constable McKenzie’s examination of the truck was inadequate and, as the vehicle cannot now be located, it is not possible to conduct the sort of detailed examination recommended by Mr Stead and Mr Cool. The applicant cannot have a fair trial, it was said, because he has been deprived of the opportunity to establish that the truck found in his possession is not the one which he had reported stolen. It was pointed out that it is the behaviour of the prosecution authorities which has put him in this position. 
      
     12  
     The Crown prosecutor submitted that the result of any further examination of the truck is purely a matter of speculation. He also relied on the apparent strength of the Crown case. It would be a remarkable coincidence, he said, for the identification plate from the vehicle which the applicant reported stolen to have later found its way on to the vehicle found in his possession. He emphasised the significance of the fact that steel marking stamps found at the applicant’s premises had been used to stamp a false chassis number on that plate. 
      
     13  
     Her Honour accepted that the Crown case is a strong one, adopting a submission by the Crown prosecutor “that while the accused has no onus whatsoever the fact of the matter is that without some explanation, if that is all the jury has then it seems impossible to envisage them concluding that it wasn’t the same vehicle”. However, this was not her only reason for refusing the application. She commented upon the seriousness of the alleged offences and the public interest in the prosecution of people suspected of crimes of that kind. Further, she did not consider that the applicant’s loss of an opportunity to examine the truck resulted in such unfairness as to warrant the permanent stay of the proceedings. She was of the opinion that “the procedures and discretions available to a trial judge” would be sufficient to remedy any unfairness. Her Honour was guided by the principles enunciated by Mason CJ in  
     Jago v District Court (NSW)  
     (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 30ff and, in particular, the Chief Justice’s observation (at 34) that a permanent stay should be ordered “only in an extreme case…”. 
      
     14  
     No evidence was led about the assembly of Holden Commodores (which, presumably, are mass produced). Nevertheless, the same submission was made as to the charge relating to the Commodore, that is, that the applicant was unable to have it more thoroughly examined. That argument met the same fate. It seems that the application was based also on the delay since the applicant’s arrest, but that was not pressed as an independent basis for a permanent stay. Nor was it in this Court. 
      
     15  
     Before us, senior counsel for the applicant submitted that her Honour’s discretion had miscarried. As to the charge involving the truck, he argued that her Honour based her decision that there was no unfairness warranting a stay purely upon her finding that the evidence was sufficient to warrant a verdict of guilty. Reference was also made to the passage from the judgment, quoted above, in which her Honour said that it seemed impossible to envisage the jury “concluding that it wasn’t the same vehicle”. This was said to have reversed the burden of proof, the true question for the jury being whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the same vehicle. Clearly, that is so but, reading the passage as a whole, I am satisfied that this was a slip of the tongue and it does not persuade me that this Court should intervene. 
      
     16  
     Her Honour was called upon to make a discretionary judgment, and I can detect no error in her approach to the matter. It is true that she referred to the strength of the Crown case but, as I have said, that was not the only foundation for her conclusion. She dealt appropriately with the potential unfairness to the applicant, having regard to the public interest in the fairness of trials, on the one hand, and the prosecution of persons charged with serious offences, on the other. 
      
     17  
     For the same reasons, it cannot be said that her Honour’s discretion miscarried in relation to the charge concerning the Commodore. Indeed, senior counsel for the applicant realistically conceded that, as to that charge, he was on much weaker ground.  
      
     18  
     Certainly, it is regrettable that the Kenworth truck was not examined more thoroughly and that both vehicles were not retained, although whether further examination of either of them would have assisted the defence case will never be known. No doubt, the loss of that opportunity will be the subject of comment by counsel for the applicant at his trial and will found an argument that the evidence is inadequate to identify the vehicles (or, at least, the truck). At the end of the day, however, this is one of a number of cases in which the unavailability of evidence does not warrant the grant of a permanent stay: see  
     R v Tolmie  
     (CCA unreported, 7 December 1994) and the cases referred to at p5 of the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL. 
      
     19  
     I would propose that leave to appeal be granted, given the unusual circumstances of the case, but that the appeal be dismissed.

     JUDGMENT 
      
     20  
     SMART AJ 
     : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the refusal of the District Court to stay permanently the hearing of two charges against him, firstly, that at Nowra about 28 September 1990, with intent to obtain money, he published a statement in an insurance claim that motor vehicle UUJ601 (a Kenworth prime mover with South Australian Registration) had been stolen, which was false in a material particular in that to his knowledge it had not been stolen. The second charge alleged that at Lithgow on 20 February 1992 he stole a 1991 Holden Commodore SS sedan AAF 48Y (NSW registration) the property of Neil and Emmery Timlin. 
      
     21  
     In 1994 the applicant was living in South Australia. About 19 May 1994 consequent upon complaints made to the South Australian Police they seized four vehicles under the applicant’s control. The applicant was arrested that day in relation to the two subject charges and on other allegations. On 23 May 1994 Constable P R McKenzie, a police vehicle examiner, examined a Holden Commodore. On 24 May 1994 he examined a red and white Kenworth prime mover and took a number of photographs. He also examined the two other vehicles seized from Roberts. On 20 June 1994 Constable McKenzie made a brief report of his examination of each of the four vehicles. As to the Kenworth prime mover and the Holden Commodore he noted the salient features and concluded that the Kenworth and the Commodore appeared to have been stolen. He suggested that they should be retained. 
      
     22  
     On 1 July 1994 the applicant was again arrested in relation to the subject charges. On 5 July 1994 pursuant to an extradition order he was brought in custody from South Australia to New South Wales. On 19 July 1994 Constable McKenzie carried out examinations on three sets of steel marking stamps which had been found in premises associated with the applicant. He said that steel marking stamps numbered 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 from one of the sets were used to produce the re-stamped numbers on the compliance plate of the truck.  
      
     23  
     Sometime prior to 17 August 1994 the police brief was served and included Constable McKenzie’s brief report of 20 June 1994. The police are unable to say when the detailed statements of 8 August 1994 prepared by Constable McKenzie were served. As to the Kenworth prime mover Constable McKenzie stated that the original chassis number had been ground off from the chassis rail in an attempt to hide the identity of the vehicle, that the engine number on the engine block had been obscured by using a tool to punch small depressions over the number and making the area appear similar to the cast surface on the remainder of the engine block and that an attempt had been made to obscure the original chassis number stamped into an identification plate attached to the fire wall and another number had been stamped over the top of the original in an attempt to re-identify the prime mover. The stamps used were those found in the applicant’s possession. 
      
     24  
     While Constable P R McKenzie was aware that other tests could be done, he regarded those done as sufficient. Constable McKenzie’s identification of the “new” stamps on the identification plate as having come from stamps in the applicant’s possession was telling. The applicant was in difficulty explaining how a red and white Kenworth prime mover with the chassis and engine numbers obscured and a compliance plate with the same chassis number on the compliance plate as that of the Kenworth prime mover which he reported stolen in 1990 and with numbers superimposed on the plate with stamps found in his premises came to be in his possession in May 1994. 
      
     25  
     The applicant sought to overcome these problems by evidence as to the frequent replacement of parts in prime movers, their individual nature and construction and the inspections which could have been done, for example, obtaining the individual numbers on axles and the transmission. 
      
     26  
     As to the Commodore, Constable McKenzie reported that there had been an attempt to change its identity by removing the original compliance and vehicle identification plates and attaching plates from a similar Commodore, by obscuring the original engine number by using a tool to punch holes in the engine number pad and by covering or removing the chassis number located behind the windscreen. Constable McKenzie located a vehicle identification number on a broadcast sheet under the carpet on the passenger’s side of the vehicle and on a metal plate behind the front left head light. The number on the sheet and the plate was identical. It was also the chassis number of the Commodore reported stolen at Lithgow on 20 February 1992. There was a photograph of the broadcast sheet but not of the metal plate behind the front left headlights. 
      
     27  
     It was common ground that neither the Kenworth prime mover nor the Commodore were returned to the applicant. We were told that the insurer which had met the applicant’s claim on the Kenworth prime mover asserted its entitlement to the prime mover seized in 1994 and obtained it. It was sold in November 1994. The applicant has not commenced any proceedings against the insurer nor taken any steps to recover the prime mover or damages in lieu of the prime mover. The only suggested explanation was that criminal proceedings were pending. 
      
     28  
     The information as to the Commodore was even more sketchy. We were told that it went to somebody other than the applicant. The insurer probably asserted a claim to it and it was probably sold. The applicant has not commenced proceedings against the insurer. 
      
     29  
     The committal proceedings were heard between 20 and 22 March 1995. On the latter date the applicant was committed for trial. The applicant did not seek to have the vehicle examined at any stage before or during or at the conclusion of the committal proceedings. On 7 September 1995 the matter was fixed for trial on 24 June 1996. That trial date was vacated on 13 May 1996. On 26 June 1997 the trial was fixed to begin on 5 January 1998 but that date was subsequently vacated. On 4 December 1997 the trial was fixed to commence on 29 September 1998. Until early August 1998 the applicant had been represented by Peter Ash and Associates, Solicitors, Sydney. On 13 August 1998 the applicant instructed his present solicitors to act for him in these proceedings. On 4 September 1998 the applicant’s present solicitors asked when and where they could have the prime mover and the Commodore examined. They were told by the Crown that neither vehicle could be located.  
      
     30  
     A Kenworth prime mover is likely to have a substantial value and the Commodore is likely to have more than a minimal value. The persons apparently entitled to the vehicles could not be expected to wait some years to obtain them. The commercial loss would be appreciable especially as the prices of most vehicles tend to decrease as they age. Nor could the police be expected to hold the vehicles for some years on the off chance that the applicant may wish to examine them. I have some difficulty with the proposition that an accused does not have to act in a timely way. Any examination should be held within a reasonable time. Once the applicant received the Crown brief with Constable McKenzie’s report he knew what was being alleged. The statements made the position even clearer. Having taken no steps to request an examination until early September 1998 the applicant is in some difficulty complaining about not being able to examine the vehicles. That is a delay of four years. An accused should not proceed on the basis that the use of assets of others will be frozen until a trial is held, especially where they have a substantial value. If he wishes to have tests or inspections carried out they should be done with reasonable promptitude. Delays in criminal trials in New South Wales are well and widely known. 
      
     31  
     For the proposed earlier trials it was apparently not considered necessary or desirable to have the vehicles inspected. When the delay in the request to have the vehicles examined is coupled with the lack of action by the applicant to recover either vehicle or damages in lieu thereof, the complaint that the applicant has been deprived of the opportunity of a fair trial lacks substance. The applicant cannot complain of self inflicted losses. The applicant does appear to have been experienced in dealing with motor vehicles. 
      
     32  
     I add two comments. The fact that items such as vehicles cannot sensibly be retained until trial means that the prosecution’s inspections should be thorough. It is also desirable for a record to be kept of where the goods (including vehicles) are, that is to whom they have been sold and where they are being kept. This may pose practical difficulties once the person to whom the police have delivered the goods disposes of them. 
      
     33  
     The applicant relied heavily on the evidence of Mr Alan Stead, National Service Manager of Kenworth Trucks. His evidence was to this effect. The company’s trucks are custom built and most of the major components have their own serial numbers. For each truck a “bill of material” is prepared setting out its components and the company keeps microfiche records of them. The chassis number was an important reference but if it was discernible only from a removable plate (such as an identification plate) it was of much reduced value. To identify a particular vehicle it was necessary to check the chassis number and the serial numbers of all major components. The various components can readily be transferred from one truck to another. 
      
     34  
     Constable McKenzie was dependent on the identification plate which appeared to have been riveted onto the fire wall of the vehicle after the new numbers had been punched onto it. That had to be taken in conjunction with the evidence as to the set of stamps in the applicant’s possession. 
      
     35  
     The evidence of Mr Raymond Cool, who was experienced in the recovery and repossession of trucks over a lengthy period was to the effect that the only way to identify a truck is to examine every item and that it was too simplistic to look at major components. In my view much must depend on what the examination conducted and the other evidence reveals. 
      
     36  
     The applicant complained that he could not have a fair trial because the inspection of Constable McKenzie was not sufficiently comprehensive and he could no longer have the vehicle examined. He had lost the opportunity to show or at least raise a reasonable doubt that the truck found in his possession was not the one which he had reported stolen. He contended that this was the fault of the prosecution in not retaining the truck. I see no fault on the part of the prosecution authorities in releasing the truck. As earlier mentioned, the fault lay mainlywith the applicant for not having a timely examination of the vehicle. 
      
     37  
     The applicant contended that if the Crown case on the present materials appeared to be a strong one that underlined the need for the applicant to have the vehicle examined. 
      
     38  
     The judge seems to have decided the application on these grounds 
      
      (a) there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury which could infer that the truck reported missing in 1990 was that seized in 1994 and that if the evidence remained as it was the jury would so infer. 
      
       
        (b) the alleged offences were serious and there is the public interest in those committing serious offences being prosecuted 
        
        (c) this was not an “extreme case” where a permanent stay should be granted. The procedures and discretions available to a trial judge would be sufficient to cure any unfairness or prejudice to the accused that may arise in the trial. The loss of the opportunity to have the truck examined on the applicant’s behalf did not result in such unfairness as to warrant a stay. It was unknown what a further inspection of the truck might disclose. Even if it appeared from the serial numbers that components had come from diverse places, perhaps emanating from different repair work or shops, there was still sufficient for the jury to infer that it was the same truck in 1990 and 1994. 
       
      
     39  
     It was open to the judge to take this view. She could have taken an even stronger view based on the lack of action by the applicant to recover the vehicle and damages and his failure to request an examination at a much earlier date. 
      
     40  
     The applicant criticised this sentence in the judge’s reasons: 
      
      “I also accept his [the Crown Prosecutor’s] submission that while the accused has no onus whatsoever the fact of the matter is that without some explanation, if that is all the jury has then it seems impossible to envisage them concluding that it wasn’t the same vehicle.” 
      
     41  
     It was submitted that the judge had mis-stated the onus of proof, the true question being whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the same. The judge was not purporting to make a comprehensive statement of the law. She was accepting a factual comment made by the Crown which used the double negative. The words “impossible to envisage them concluding that it wasn’t the same vehicle” mean when put in positive terms that it is hard to envisage the jury concluding that the 1994 vehicle was other than the 1990 vehicle. I do not think that the particular form of words used is, in the context, of any consequence. 
      
     42  
     The applicant’s case as to the Commodore was significantly weaker than its case as to the truck. It was not suggested that Commodore vehicles are custom built The number found on each of the broadcast sheet and on a metal plate behind the front left head were identical. That number was the same as the last 6 digits of the chassis number of the stolen vehicle. There is no sufficient basis for the grant of a stay of the court proceedings based on the Commodore. 
      
     43  
     The judge did not err in the exercise of her discretion. I would go further. In my opinion the decision which she reached was correct. 
      
     44  
     The application for leave to appeal should be granted. The appeal should be dismissed.

     BARR J McINERNEY AJ Wednesday, 26 May 1999 
     
     REGINA v Matthew Donald STAHL 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   BARR J: The applicant, Matthew Donald Stahl, seeks leave to appeal from a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 9 April 1998. Acting Judge Nader of Queen’s Counsel convicted the applicant of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon and imposed a sentence of penal servitude for five years, comprising a minimum term of three years commencing on 20 January 1998 and expiring on 19 January 2001 and an additional term of two years. In sentencing the applicant, his Honour took into account under the provisions of s 21 Criminal Procedure Act an offence of creating a public mischief. 
     
      
    2   On 19 January 1998, the applicant hailed a taxi driven by Mr David Woodward. He directed the driver to a certain, place in Broadmeadow where he had parked his car. When the taxi stopped, the applicant took out a knife and put it to Mr Woodward’s throat, demanding his car key, his wallet and his takings. Having robbed Mr Woodward of those things, he ran to his car and got away. Later on he reported his car stolen to the police station. That act constituted the offence which his Honour took into account. On the following day police went to his house and found clothing like that worn by the robber. The applicant directed the police to a place at Broadmeadow where his car was parked. In it were Mr Woodward’s coin dispenser and the knife which had been used in the attack. The applicant was taken to the Newcastle Police Station and made full formal admissions. He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. 
     
      
    3   In a careful and detailed judgment, his Honour reviewed the facts and the personal history of the applicant. He noted that the applicant had been injured in a road accident in 1989 and again in 1992. His Honour noted that he suffered from epilepsy and needed medicine to control seizures. His Honour had before him a psychiatric report of Dr Lambeth dated 17 December 1997 and apparently used by the applicant in a Court application for compensation arising out of the 1989 accident. His Honour accepted that the applicant suffered from major depression at the time of that report. His Honour also had before him the report of a psychologist, Mr J T Holland. His Honour concluded that the applicant suffered significant pain and disability, with the need to maintain a regime of medication, which was probably going to last the rest of his life. 
     
      
    4   However, his Honour did not accept that there was any causal connection between those conditions and the commission of the crime, which his Honour found took place because the applicant wanted to get money to spend on heroin, to which he was addicted. 
     
      
    5   After some hesitation, his Honour accepted that the applicant was remorseful. His Honour paid regard to the applicant’s early confessions and co-operation with the police and early plea of guilty. 
     
      
    6   The applicant has put written submissions before the Court and has made short oral submissions to supplement them. He refers to the psychiatric report of Dr Lambeth. He reminds the Court that he suffers from epilepsy and says that he also suffers from bipolar disease. He makes mention of the drugs that he has to take. He submits that whereas he was addicted to heroin, he has stopped using the drug whilst he has been in gaol and has undergone counselling in that connection. He has progressed well in courses in the gaol and has completed his Higher School Certificate. 
     
      
    7   He says that he is ashamed and very sorry for what he did to Mr Woodward. He says that it would not have happened but for his drug problem. He makes reference to his early school leaving and work history. He refers to some of his experiences in prison. 
     
      
    8   Other than matters which have occurred since the date of sentence, all the matters referred to in the applicant’s submissions were before his Honour and most of them were in terms referred to by his Honour. It is not permissible for the Court, in deciding whether the sentence imposed by his Honour fell outside his proper range of sentencing discretion, to take into account events that have happened since. 
     
      
    9   It is important to note, the applicant, while in gaol, has come to grips with his heroin addiction and forsworn any further involvement with the drug. His report may be accepted as demonstrating that the period of penal servitude ordered by his Honour is having good effect. 
     
      
    10   The applicant refers the Court to R v Davies, an unreported decision of this Court of 1 December 1995. A man convicted of holding up a service station with a kitchen knife appealed against a sentence of imprisonment of five years three months. His sentence was reduced to three years six months. However, each case is different and one case does not demonstrate the limits of a sentencing Judge’s discretion. There are many cases of armed robbery in which sentences have been imposed well in excess of the one considered appropriate in that case. 
     
      
    11   A more useful case, I think, is R v Henry, Court of Criminal Appeal 12 May 1999, where it was said to be appropriate in cases like the present to impose a sentence between four and five years full term. 
     
      
    12   It has not been shown that his Honour made any error of principle or that the sentence imposed by his Honour fell outside the range of his sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    13   I would refuse leave to appeal. 
     
      
    14   McINERNEY AJ: I agree. 
     
      
    15   BARR J: The order of the Court is as I have proposed.

     JAMES J BARR J CARRUTHERS AJ Tuesday, 18 May 1999 
     
     REGINA v Edward Joseph Curtis HOULTON 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   JAMES J: I will call upon Barr J to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2   BARR J: This is an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act against an order made by his Honour Judge Bell in the District Court on 12 August 1998 refusing a permanent stay of proceedings on an indictment charging the applicant with eighty-five counts of fraudulent misappropriation. The acts constituting the offences are said to have been committed between August 1989 and September 1992, when the applicant was practising as a solicitor. The total sum involved exceeds $400,000. 
     
      
    3   His Honour’s order was an interlocutory judgment or order for the purposes of s 5F, but since his Honour has not certified that it is a proper one for determination on appeal the applicant may not proceed with the appeal without the leave of this Court. Leave will be granted only where the decision the subject of the application is attended by sufficient doubt as to warrant the matter being argued on appeal, or where the interests of justice otherwise require the intervention of the Court at the interlocutory stage. R v Carter, Court of Criminal Appeal, 5 September 1995, unreported; R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633; R v Matovski (1989) 14 NSWLR 720. 
     
      
    4   The principles to be applied in an application for a permanent stay of proceedings may be found in Jago v District Court (1989) 169 CLR 123 and Walton v Gardiner (1992-1993) 177 CLR 378. The summary of Deane J in Jago v District Court at 60 will suffice for present purposes. His Honour there said: 
     
      
       
        
        An order that proceedings be permanently stayed will only be justified in the exceptional cases which I have indicated, namely, where it appears that the effect of the unreasonable delay is, in all the circumstances, that any subsequent trial will necessarily be an unfair one or that the continuation of the proceedings would be so unfairly oppressive that it would constitute an abuse of process. 
        
       
      
    5   The broad history of this matter may be summarised as follows. In August 1994 the applicant was charged. On 20 October 1994 he was committed to the District Court for trial. On 3 April 1995 a draft indictment was served. On 26 February 1996 the applicant was arraigned at Coffs Harbour and pleaded not guilty to the charges. On 20 May 1996 the trial was due to commence at Coffs Harbour but a misunderstanding had occurred about whether the trial should be by jury or by judge alone. The Crown required a trial by jury but the hearing time had apparently been estimated as appropriate for a judge alone trial. It appears as though the Court had insufficient time to hear the trial. As well, the applicant served medical evidence on the Crown, some of which was fresh, disclosing an intended defence of non-insane automatism. The trial date was vacated. The revised estimate was up to one month of hearing time. 
     
      
    6   The trial was fixed to commence on 21 July 1997 but in May 1997 the fixture was vacated because it was realised that there would be insufficient time to hear the trial at the forthcoming sittings. This is unfortunate because a special request had previously been made by counsel for the applicant on the occasion of the vacation of the first hearing date that a special fixture be arranged. 
     
      
    7   On 23 June 1997 the applicant wrote a letter to the Attorney-General raising a number of matters, particularly the applicant’s financial condition and the fact that he had been advised that his grant of legal aid was about to be terminated. The letter was treated as a no bill application and in a reply dated 4 November 1997 the Director of Public Prosecutions informed the applicant that it was intended to proceed with the trial. Insofar as that circumstance delayed the setting down of a hearing, therefore, there was a delay of a little over five months. 
     
      
    8   On 18 May 1998 there was a third trial date. In view of the estimated hearing time, namely about a month, and of the risk that there might be insufficient time for the case to be heard at Coffs Harbour in ordinary sittings, a judge made a special visit to that city intending to hear the matter, no matter how long it took. Unfortunately, the fixture had to be vacated, this time by consent, because of new material which emerged in a report of a psychiatrist, Dr Rickarby, bearing on the health of the applicant and his ability to cope with a trial. 
     
      
    9   Judge Bell heard the application which resulted in the order against which leave is now sought to appeal on 11 August 1998 and delivered judgment on the following day. He received an affidavit from the applicant, who was cross-examined. Documents were tendered, including a statement of facts. Some of the documents have been put before this Court and the Court has a transcript of the evidence and a copy of his Honour’s reasons for judgment. 
     
      
    10   As appears from his Honour’s reasons for judgment, the applicant’s principal grounds in support of the application were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (1) notwithstanding the age of the matter, the applicant still did not know how many witnesses the Crown intended to call at the trial; 
       
       
      (2) the passage of time had substantially interfered with his ability to adduce evidence at the trial, particularly evidence as to his state of health and the drugs he was taking at the times set forth in the indictment; 
       
       
      (3) Dr Rickarby thought that the applicant was suffering from a major depression with pathological grief at the time of the matters set forth in the indictment and that he could not represent himself at trial; 
       
       
      (4) although the applicant had a grant of legal aid, it was a condition that he pay to the Legal Aid Commission a contribution of $2000. He could not afford to pay any such sum. In his affidavit he swore that his income was $334 per week and his expenditure $335 per week. So he was effectively without legal representation. 
       
       
      (5) the delay had exacerbated the applicant’s serious health problems. 
       
      
    11   Having heard the evidence and the arguments on both sides, his Honour came to a number of conclusions, which may be summarised thus: 
     
      
       
      (1) The matter had never been left in abeyance and the applicant had not been inconvenienced by court procedures, which included the holding of several call-overs which the applicant had decided not to attend. 
       
       
      (2) Ever since the charges were laid the applicant had been aware of the state of the proceedings and although he had protested to the Attorney-General about delay, among other things, he had never complained to the Court or applied for a special fixture or for an expedited hearing. 
       
       
      (3) There was no factual basis for the claim made by the applicant in his affidavit that during 1996 and 1997 he believed that the Crown did not intend to proceed with the charges. The frequency of call-overs demonstrated the contrary. 
       
       
      (4) Allowance had to be made for the complexity of the case as a whole and the number of witnesses who would have to be called, necessitating a time frame longer than normal. 
       
       
      (5) The applicant had not been advised with precision which witnesses the Crown intended to call, but there were about one hundred, the estimated number having been increased from the original thirty-nine about six months before the hearing before his Honour. 
       
       
      (6) From the beginning of the prosecution the applicant had conceded having committed the acts relied on by the Crown but, as his Honour put the matter, “challenged the mens rea elements of the offences.” That fact was not properly appreciated by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which had been “reprehensively inefficient” in taking some three and a half years to obtain a relevant psychiatric report. 
       
       
      (7) Even though the nature of the defence had never changed, the Crown had decided to call one hundred witnesses instead of the original thirty-nine. The increase was not explained by the medical report served. This was a matter about which the applicant was entitled to complain. 
       
       
      (8) His Honour did not accept the claim by the applicant to have had difficulty in obtaining evidence since there was no evidence of any attempt to investigate the availability of evidence. 
       
       
      (9) Although criminal proceedings would produce stress, his Honour did not accept that the applicant’s health would be endangered. His Honour referred to the extent to which the applicant had taken on onerous responsibilities and commitments in community life and work. 
       
       
      (10) The applicant’s mental health would not be endangered by the continuation of the prosecution. 
       
       
      (11) His Honour did not accept the evidence of the applicant about the claimed excess of expenditure over income. His Honour found that the applicant had the capacity further to explore with the Manager of the Legal Aid Commission the means of paying the contribution and that he had available the financial resources to do so. Although it might take some time to achieve such a thing, the appointment of a fixed trial date in 1999 could be arranged to accommodate it. 
       
       
      (12) Notwithstanding the existence of the prejudice that his Honour found the applicant had suffered, he would not be deprived of a fair trial. His Honour concluded that there was no basis for regarding the continuation of the proceedings as unfairly and unjustifiably oppressive. 
       
      
    12   The grounds the applicant will argue if granted leave to appeal are that his Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the following matters: 
     
      
       
       (a) the nature and extent of the various delays bringing him to trial; 
       
       
       (b) the past and present medical condition of the applicant and the impact of delays upon his health; 
       
       
       (c) the difficulty in obtaining competent legal representation for the trial; and 
       
       
       (d) the prejudice to the applicant because of continuing doubt as to the number of prosecution witnesses, the identity of further prosecution witnesses, obtaining evidence in support of his defence, the date of trial, the availability of legal representation through legal aid, and the ability to continue in his employment. 
       
      
    13   Speaking to the application for leave to appeal, counsel for the applicant sought to demonstrate that his Honour had made findings of fact which were not supported by the evidence and had taken into account extraneous matter. At p 13 of his judgment, his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        There is no reasonable basis upon which Mr Houlton can justify his assumption during 1996 to 1997 as stated in par 15 of his affidavit that ‘the Crown did not intend to proceed.’ There is no evidence upon which such an assumption could be based. Indeed, the frequency of the ongoing call-overs demonstrated quite the contrary. 
        
       
      
    14   The Court’s attention was drawn to a submission made by the Crown Prosecutor before his Honour, to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        Your Honour, in my respectful submission, that is a matter that can readily be solved, when the matter has been determined, and when the trial date has been appropriately fixed, and then your Honour the focus will, on all people involved in the case, go to, ‘Let’s get this case on the road, who are the witnesses, what are the charges, what are the documents that we require, who do we want’ all of these things can then be attended to, your Honour. I’m not being critical of anybody, don’t misunderstand me, your Honour, but there has been, perhaps, a lack of will to get on with dealing with the nuts and bolts of the case, up to this point of time, for the very simple reason, your Honour, that people didn’t know whether they were going to run the trial or not. 
        
       
      
    15   This last part of the Crown Prosecutor’s submission was said to justify the belief, contrary to his Honour’s finding, that there was a reasonable apprehension that the trial was not going to continue. I think that what the Crown Prosecutor must have been referring to was the occasion late in 1997 when the applicant’s letter to the Attorney-General came to be dealt with by the Director of Public Prosecutions as a no bill application. In my opinion, insofar as what the Crown Prosecutor said qualifies his Honour’s finding, it does not vitiate his Honour’s judgment. 
     
      
    16   The next finding of fact attacked was his Honour’s statement that through the entire time since the charges were laid the applicant had been aware of the proceedings and although he protested to the Attorney-General’s Department about, inter alia, delay, he made no complaints within the court system or an application for a special fixture or expedited hearing. It was pointed out that the applicant had written a letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 6 March 1997 complaining about the lack of progress in the matter and asking whether it might have been decided that the matter should not proceed. The applicant also wrote the letter of 23 June 1997 to the Attorney-General, to which I have already referred. 
     
      
    17   I do not see the existence of these letters leading to the conclusion that his Honour was not entitled to make the finding of fact under attack, and I note that earlier in his judgment his Honour noted that counsel for the applicant had applied on the occasion of the first adjournment for the making a special fixture. I think this attack on his Honour’s finding of fact fails. 
     
      
    18   The next fact attacked was this. At p 15 of his Honour’s judgment he said: 
     
      
       
        
        Undoubtedly any criminal proceeding will be productive of stress for those the subject of it. In terms of Mr Houlton’s physical condition, there is no evidence that his health is endangered by the continuation of the prosecution. Indeed, the extent to which the applicant has stated he has taken on onerous responsibilities and commitments in relation to his involvement in community housing does, prima facie, demonstrate he has physical capacity and reserves of a significant order. 
        
       
      
    19   It was put to the Court that that conclusion was unfavourable in view of statements made in the report of Dr Rickarby dated 30 May 1995, a copy of which was before his Honour, and of a report of Dr Delaforce, a psychiatrist qualified by the Crown, dated 22 May 1998. In part of his report Dr Rickarby said that the applicant’s medical condition was quite serious and of bad prognosis. He had the major risk factors for myocardial infarction and stroke: major hypertension requiring closely monitored treatment, hyperlipidaemia (that is, familial elevated cholesterol or other blood lipids), previous heart attack, his smoking fifteen or more cigarettes a day, and age. 
     
      
    20   Dr Delaforce said this at p 7 of his report: 
     
      
       
        
        He has had considerable problems with his physical health and continues to require treatment for his ulcer and high blood pressure. They are medical conditions that can deteriorate with increasing and prolonged stress. During a trial his medical health would need to be closely monitored, even if he had adequate legal representation, and more frequently if he did not. Even if he was legally represented he may have acute stomach pain and/or vomiting because of the ulcer or, and much less likely, an acute complication of this high blood pressure temporarily affecting his mental functioning or something more serious such as a stroke. Such risks would be more likely if he was to represent himself. 
        
       
      
    21   His Honour took those matters into account no doubt. One of the matters his Honour would have had in mind was the age of the report of Dr Rickarby, combined with the evidence of the comparatively onerous and strenuous activities which the applicant had since undertaken. I think that his Honour in all the circumstances was entitled to come to the view that he did and I think that this attack on his Honour’s finding of fact fails. 
     
      
    22   Then it was said his Honour took into account extraneous matters. It was said that his Honour should have weighed the applicant’s capacity to meet the legal aid contribution by reference to his income rather than by making reference, as his Honour did, to the cost which would be required to fund a trial by privately-funded counsel. 
     
      
    23   I think that there is no substance in this submission. His Honour clearly had in mind the income of the applicant and made particular reference to it and his Honour was well aware that the contribution required was $2000, that substantial work towards the preparation and conduct of the trial could be done if he contributed as much as $1000, and that even that might be done by instalments. 
     
      
    24   Then his Honour was said to have erred in his remark that this case bears no relation to the case of R v Nicholson, an unreported decision of this Court, judgment in which was delivered on 22 July 1998. In my opinion, it matters not whether this case is like Nicholson or not. That is a question on which opinions may differ. A proper approach requires the identification of the principles to be applied and their application to the facts of this case. 
     
      
    25   In my opinion, these various attacks on his Honour’s findings fail. 
     
      
    26   I conclude that this is a case the outstanding features of which are that there has been substantial delay. Some has been the responsibility of the court system and some has occurred because of the emergence of events close to the intended trial dates. The length of the delay is particularly regrettable and this case, in my opinion, calls for the kind of special management it was given for the first time in 1998. It is indeed unfortunate that on that occasion the date had to be vacated a third time. 
     
      
    27   Even so, his Honour was correct in concluding that the delay did not prejudice the applicant in the conduct of his defence. 
     
      
    28   This Court has now been informed that the Crown intends to call only the thirty-nine witnesses originally intended. 
     
      
    29   It appears to me that his Honour’s decision not to stay proceedings on the indictment fell within the bounds of his discretion. In my opinion, the appeal would be unlikely to succeed if the proposed grounds were permitted to be argued. 
     
      
    30   I would refuse leave to appeal. 
     
      
    31   JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of Barr J. 
     
      
    32   CARRUTHERS AJ: I also agree. I would merely add that I respectfully endorse what his Honour has said, that this case calls for special case management. If this case management does not occur, one can only fear that this case may well develop into a blot on the escutcheon of the criminal justice system in this State. 
     
      
    33   I agree with the orders proposed by Barr J. 
     
      
    34   JAMES J: The order of the Court will be as proposed by Barr J. Leave to appeal is refused.

     BARR J GREG JAMES J CARRUTHERS AJ Tuesday, 18 May 1999 
     
     REGINA v Malcolm Thomas GREEN 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1 BARR J: The applicant, Malcolm Thomas Green, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him after his conviction by a jury of manslaughter.2 The facts may be summarised as follows. On 19 May 1993 the applicant was a 22 year old single man. He had had an unhappy childhood. His father used to beat his mother and sexually assaulted his sisters. He witnessed the beatings of his mother and was told by his mother about his father’s conduct towards his sisters. When he was 10 years old the matters came to a head and were reported to the police. The applicant’s father left or was expelled from the family. As a result the applicant hated his father.3 Between 1985 and 1992 the applicant was convicted of twelve offences, principally concerning theft and the cultivation and use of illegal drugs. He served three short prison sentences. Two of his convictions were for assault.4 The deceased was a 36 year old single man who lived with his mother. He and the applicant had been friends for about six years at the time of the events giving rise to the charge. Their relationship was a close but not a sexual one, and the applicant came to rely on the deceased for friendship and regarded him as a substitute for the father he had lost early in his life. He trusted him and valued his advice.5 On the night of the killing, 19 May 1993, the deceased’s mother was absent from Mudgee and the deceased invited the applicant to his house for dinner. Both men drank a good deal of alcohol. After dinner they watched television and the deceased asked the applicant to stay the night. The deceased told the applicant that he could sleep in his, the deceased’s, bedroom and that the deceased would use his mother’s room.6 In his account to the police, the applicant said that he went to bed and that after a while the deceased entered the room and slid into the bed beside him, naked, and started touching him. The applicant pushed him away and protested. The deceased persisted, however, grabbing the applicant with both arms. The struggle intensified as the deceased tried to touch the applicant’s private parts and the applicant began hitting him.7 The applicant told the police that he continued to hit the deceased whilst he was on the bed, that the deceased rolled off the bed and that he noticed some poultry shears lying on the bedroom floor. He grabbed the shears and stabbed the deceased in the back.8 The objective evidence of injury to the body of the deceased shows that the attack could only be described as ferocious. There were ten stab wounds to the back of the chest. On the left side, one of them passed through the left shoulder blade. Another passed through the seventh rib on the left side and from there into lung tissue, having a minimum depth of four inches. On the right side there were six stab wounds, three of which entered the right chest cavity. Two passed between the fourth and fifth ribs on the right and all three passed into the tissue of the right lung.9 Dr Duflou, a forensic pathologist, described an additional sixteen injuries on the surface of the body which he said were caused by a blunt object. They included a transverse fracture through both anterior cranial fossae. The fracture extended from one side of the head to the other and Dr Duflou described it as almost a hinge fracture of the skull. The nose and cheekbones were fractured. The second and third ribs on the left and the second rib on the right were fractured. There was bruising and haemorrhaging of the brain, including deep bleeding.10 Dr Duflou first expressed the opinion that a heavy weapon would have been required to inflict the blunt injuries, but later conceded that it was possible that they could have been caused by a fist. That is what his Honour found.11 About two hours later, having tried to clean up some of the blood, the applicant telephoned his brother-in-law and asked him to come and get him. When his brother-in-law complied, he asked him to drive him to the police station. The police station was unattended, so the applicant telephoned the Dubbo police station. A message was sent out and a patrolling police officer attended. The applicant told the officer that he had killed the deceased because, as he said, “He tried to root me”. He said that he knew he had done the wrong thing but that the deceased had done worse to him. He said that he had just snapped.12 Later on he was formally interviewed and confirmed hitting the deceased whilst he was on the bed and stabbing him whilst he was on the floor. When he was asked whether he wanted to say anything else about the matter, he said that he tried to take it (which must, I think, mean the deceased’s approach) as a funny joke, and continued - 
     
      
       
        
         
         but in relation to what my father had done to four of my sisters, it forced me to open more than I could bear. It hasn’t changed the fact to what happened to my family, but I couldn’t stop myself or control myself what went through me. 
         
        
       
      
    13 The applicant pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown proceeded with the charge of murder and manslaughter was left to the jury on two possible bases, namely provocation and unlawful and dangerous act. Because of the way the trial was conducted, only the former basis was really available and his Honour expressed himself satisfied in due course that provocation was the basis of the verdict.14 This was the applicant’s second trial. At his first trial his plea and the Crown’s attitude had been the same and he had been convicted of murder. In due course that verdict was set aside by the High Court of Australia, which ordered the new trial.15 The applicant was held in custody, bail refused, between the time of his arrest on 20 May 1993 and 22 December 1997, shortly after the order for the new trial. After that he was allowed bail until his conviction, a period of nine months eleven days.16 His Honour imposed a sentence of penal servitude of ten years and six months, comprising a minimum term of eight years commencing on 20 May 1993, and an additional term of two years six months, expiring on 19 November 2003.17 The first ground of appeal related to the time which elapsed between the deceased’s provocative act and the applicant’s unlawful response. Counsel referred to a passage from the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Alexander (1994) 78 A Crim R 141 at 144 in which his Honour observed that a survey of cases and other material showed, for sentencing purposes, that three particular matters had been taken into account in provocation manslaughter cases. They were the degree of provocation offered or alternatively the extent of the loss of self control suffered, the time between the provocation and the loss of self control and the degree of violence or aggression displayed by the prisoner.18 It was submitted that his Honour had failed altogether to take into account the second of those matters, a consideration of the time which elapsed between the provocative act and the unlawful response.19 In fact his Honour referred in terms to the passage to which I have referred from the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL and immediately thereafter dealt with the first and the third matters mentioned in it. Then his Honour said this -  
     
      
       
        
         
         … there was almost a complete loss of self control, probably, as submitted by (defence counsel), over a short period of time. 
         
        
       
      
    20 It was submitted that his Honour was there referring only to the duration of the attack by the applicant on the deceased and not to the time which elapsed before the commencement of the attack.21 Even if that were so, I think that it would make no difference. His Honour’s summary of the events, in support of which the evidence was all one way, showed that his Honour dealt with the matter upon a finding that the applicant’s response followed immediately upon the deceased’s approach.22 There is no substance in this ground.23 It was next submitted that general deterrence had a limited role to play in sentencing in cases like the present, where death resulted from an immediate reaction to unexpected provocation. It was also submitted that his Honour had overlooked certain subjective factors and some criticism was made of an observation his Honour made about the lack of assistance, in determining a proper sentence, available from a consideration of sentences imposed in other cases of manslaughter. However, I think that these grounds are really subsumed in the principal submission made on behalf of the applicant, namely that by reference to all the objective and subjective features and to whatever assistance can be obtained from a consideration of other sentences in manslaughter cases, the very length of the sentence imposed is too great.24 Determining a proper sentence for manslaughter is notoriously difficult. Some assistance may be received from a consideration of the facts of other cases and the sentences imposed therein, but those cases do not determine an inflexible range of available sentences or reduce the maximum penalty applicable to a case which falls into the worst category of cases, namely 25 years’ penal servitude.25 Since the applicant spent a little over nine months of the minimum term on bail, the sentence may be regarded for practical purposes as being of nine years nine months, comprising a minimum term of seven years three months and an additional term of two years six months.26 Counsel referred to a number of decided cases, including those contained in the schedules to the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Alexander in order to show that those in which sentences were greater or close to the one appealed from were imposed in much worse cases overall, so as to support a submission that the sentence was outside the available range.27 In R v Morabito (1992) 62 A Crim R 82, where there was a sentence of ten years and six months, there was only a small loss of self control and no immediate precipitating event. The appellant carried out a great deal of planning and deception, motivated partly by a desire to continue with an extra-marital affair, and incited her lover to kill her husband. On the other hand, there were features favouring a lenient sentence which are not present in this case, namely that the deceased’s provocation comprised an accumulation of violent and degrading conduct over many years, including the use of force against family members, degrading sexual practices and sexual inference with the children. The case report does not suggest that the appellant had any criminal history.28 In R v Panozzo, Court of Criminal Appeal 25 March 1993 unreported, there was a sentence of nine years. There was a plea of not guilty but the only issue raised at the trial was provocation. The killing was a particularly violent one, done in the presence of two young children. The prisoner had a predisposition towards violence.29 In R v Pavia, Court of Criminal Appeal 9 December 1994 unreported, a sentence of twelve years was reduced on appeal to ten years. The appellant killed his homosexual lover in a violent attack, which apparently grew out of a series of arguments and fights that they had had. The appellant was a man of prior good character.30 In R v Isaacs (1997) 90 A Crim R 587 there was an effective sentence of ten years two months. The deceased was a violent man who had previously threatened the appellant with a rifle. The atmosphere between them and other occupants of the premises where they lived was tense. There was no immediate trigger for the appellant’s unlawful act and he went and woke the deceased whilst he was asleep and beat him to death with a dowel. The appellant was a man of prior good character.31 There were several other cases to which the attention of the Court was referred as well, but I do not think it necessary to refer to them individually. All or virtually all of them involved sentences less, some far less, than the one appealed against.32 The comparison of the sentences in each of the cases to which I have referred and the similarities and dissimilarities in the facts which gave rise to those sentences illustrate the difficulties faced not only by a trial judge in determining a proper sentence but by an appellant who seeks by reference to such cases to demonstrate that the sentence imposed was outside the available range of sentencing discretion. To my mind, the principal features of the present case were that the provocation offered, though unwelcome and uninvited, was not of the most serious kind, that the applicant’s response was of a remarkably violent and frenzied kind, that the applicant was a young man who already had a fairly bad criminal record, that he immediately owned up to the killing and made full confession to the police, that he entered an early and consistent plea of guilty of manslaughter and that he had taken steps in gaol towards rehabilitating himself. Overall, the offence was a serious one of its kind and called for a substantial sentence.33 The sentence was imposed by a highly experienced trial judge. It has not been suggested that his Honour mistook any of the facts.34 I do not think that the sentence has been shown, by reference to the cases or independently of them, to have exceeded his Honour’s proper range of sentencing discretion.35 I would grant leave to appeal against the sentence but would dismiss the appeal.IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL

    36 I have had the advantage of being provided with the draft judgment of Barr, J. I agree with the conclusion that he reaches and the order that he proposes.37 I have nothing to add in relation to the first ground. As to the submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive, ie., exceeded the appropriate range available for the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion, I should add a little more to what has already been said.38 Sentencing involves a synthesis of considerations and the application of policy such as to achieve an appropriate balance in any given case. It is therefore only when the sentence is such as to be outside the range which embraces those appropriate considerations as balanced in the light of the proper application of policy that an appeal will lie.39 For my own part, I may not have agreed with the sentence of the learned sentencing judge. That is not the point. When this court comes to deciding a range, it does so in the light of the views of those judges which comprise the instant bench, the views of this court as differently constituted and the views of sentencing judges generally. For me to assert a personal view would be wrong unless it were a differing view as to the range and as to that, I make the same observation as was made by Mahoney, JA. in Buckley & Anor v. Bennell Design & Constructions Pty. Limited & Anor [1977] 1 NSWLR 110 at 126, when he said:- 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""The matter is one which it is appropriate that, for this court, should be dealt with finally. To press a contrary view, if not 'a confession of failure to convince one's judicial colleagues', would be at least inappropriate.""

     REGINA v. KEVIN JOHN STEWART 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   DUNFORD, J: I will ask Greg James, J. to give the first judgment. 
    2   GREG JAMES, J: On 18 June 1998 the appellant was convicted by his Honour Judge Freeman in the District Court of New South Wales on two counts of aggravated break and enter offences after guilty verdicts returned by a jury. The first count included an allegation of intent to commit a felony, the second an allegation that the break and enter was coupled with actual stealing. The appellant was sentenced on each count to a minimum term of 12 months penal servitude to commence on 11 January 1999 and to expire on 10 January 2000, and an additional term of three years to commence on 11 January 2000 and to expire on 10 January 2003. His Honour also dealt with the prisoner in respect of the breach of certain recognisances imposing a fixed term of six months expiring on 10 January 1999. 
    3   The appellant appeals against his conviction on the sole ground that ""the jury verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory"". At this hearing the ground was described as asserting that the verdicts were unreasonable and not in accordance with the evidence. Thus, it is submitted, acquittal should be entered. The ground is expressed this way by way of reference to the criteria in s.6(1) and (2) of the Criminal Appeal Act, no doubt in deference to what has been said in this court in Regina v. Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53 by the Chief Justice at paragraphs 43-44. 
    4   The written submissions provided by the appellant's counsel describe that ground by reference to what appears in M v. The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494:- 
     
      
       
       ""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, or is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence."" 
       
      
    5   The submissions also refer to Jones v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439; Fleming v. The Queen [1998] HCA 68 and Gipp v. The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 1012.  
    6   The appellant's contentions here are that there was an absence of identification of the appellant by the victim and there was positive evidence given by persons, albeit with an involvement either in the offence or with that group of people involved in the offence, that, although a person nicknamed ""John-Boy"" was the offender, it was not the appellant who committed the offence and he was not ""John-Boy"". Therefore, it is said, the evidence of the one witness who admitted to being highly intoxicated at the time and who identified the appellant as both the offender and ""John-Boy"" ought to have been rejected by the jury. 
    7   In Gipp (supra), Gaudron, J. (at paragraphs 17 and 18), McHugh and Hayne, JJ. (at paragraph 49) and subsequently Kirby, J. (at paragraph 128) refer to the well-settled test to be applied where it is contended the jury ought not to have convicted, adverting either expressly or implicitly to the necessity to make full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury. When the appeal court embarks on an examination of the evidence, it does so cognisant of the advantages enjoyed by the jury, particularly on matters of credibility in the oral presentation of the witnesses' evidence, a matter traditionally and peculiarly for the jury. 
    8   I have reviewed the evidence admissible against the appellant. I summarise it concisely. Mr. Maley said he was asleep in his store, known as The Colosseum, on 21 October when, before midnight, a man kicked open the door and entered the premises saying, ""Mr. Maley, Mr. Maley, I come for your money, where is your money?"" and then left. At about 3.00 am the door burst open and the same person entered, saying, ""I've come for your money, where do you keep your money?"" Thereafter, a number of other persons entered. When Mr. Maley was lying on the floor his pockets were searched and keys taken. One of the intruders had a knife. They wanted to know where he kept his money and took $10. One was a young girl, who attempted to make him sign a bank withdrawal form. A knife was held to his face and his co-operation demanded. Other things were taken. 
    9   Ms. Parnis gave evidence in the Crown case that early in the evening she had been visited by various persons, including Shane Blackecki, ""John-Boy"", Zoran and Zoran's girlfriend Melissa. With those persons I have named, and on an initial approach to Mr. Maley's store, she said, ""John-Boy"" kicked in the door, went in and came back out. Stephen Rayner, she said, was present when this happened. She said that later that night she had entered Mr. Maley's store with five members of the group with whom she had been associating that evening, one of which was ""John-Boy"". On that occasion one of the group had held a knife at Mr. Maley's throat and they left taking a number of items. She had been convicted for her part in the events.  
    10   In her original statement to the police she had not mentioned ""John-Boy"" because, so she said, she was scared. She said she had not seen ""John-Boy"" since and asserted he was not in court. But on her account the person ""John-Boy"" who had twice entered the premises was the person who had been with her then, who had been at her place and who had been seen by Stephen Rayner to make the first entry. 
    11   Daniel Hudson in his evidence referred to having also met with the group. He knew ""John-Boy"" as Kevin John Stewart. He had learnt of this name since these events but had not known that person well prior to the night, had not seen him since, and did not see him in court. He denied any knowledge of the man in the dock, asserted he was not ""John-Boy"" nor part of the group. 
    12   Peta-Maree Turner-Mann saw ""John-Boy"" in the company of Shane Blackecki at Ms. Parnis' home that evening. She did not know his real name but had known him for two years. She denied seeing him in court. 
    13   The appellant admitted to police that his name was Kevin John Stewart and that he was known by the name of ""John Boy"". He agreed he knew a Zoran Krstevski and the name of Zoran's girlfriend could be Melissa. In the ERISP he apparently agreed he knew Stephen Rayner. He denied knowing any of the other persons. 
    14   Stephen Rayner gave evidence that he had known the appellant for approximately 15 years from primary school. The appellant's nickname was ""John-Boy"". He identified the appellant in court as the person he knew had that nickname. He gave evidence that on the night of 21 October 1996 he was in company with the appellant and a person called Blackecki and they went to some girl's house above the shop. There he was introduced to a girl by the name of Rachel; that a group, the nicknames of which were given but which included Blackecki, ""John-Boy"", Rachel and himself went to premises that were plainly Mr. Maley's store; ""John-Boy"" kicked the door open; a couple of people ""from what I can remember 'John-Boy' and Blackecki and someone else"" went in, ""they just went in and came out again"". Someone referred to security coming and they left. Thereafter, he and another man split from the group.  
    15   His identification of the appellant was challenged as mistaken. He was rigorously cross-examined. He accepted that he was ""heaps drunk"", having consumed 30 throwdowns between lunchtime and leading up to the incident. In his words, he was ""close to legless"". He could not remember how the people were dressed or their hair cuts. He was first asked to remember the events about 18 months later. The cross-examination concluded:- 
     
      
      
       
       ""Q. Well bearing in mind your state of intoxication, being legless and all, or near legless, I am sorry, and what you told us about your lack of ability to remember details of what they were wearing, what time it was, hairstyles, who else went in the premises, can you be sure it was John-Boy who went in the premises? A. Not really."" 
       
      
    16   In these circumstances, it is submitted that it is a case in which the jury should have had a reasonable doubt as to the identification of the appellant and that the appeal should be upheld on the basis that the appellate court would experience a doubt which the jury ought also to have experienced in the sense described in the passage from M v. The Queen set out above. 
    17   Not withstanding the skilful and succinct submissions, both orally and in writing by Mr. Cavanagh for the appellant, I am in no such doubt nor do I consider that, bearing in mind the advantage that the jury had in observing the witnesses, it was not open to them, in the sense of reasonably available to them, to reject the evidence that the appellant was not ""John-Boy"" and not the offender who entered the premises twice. To put the matter more directly, I do not consider it was incumbent on the jury to accept that evidence, particularly having regard to the assistance furnished to the jury in the summing-up, which drew attention to their entitlement to accept or reject such portions of the evidence of the witnesses as might seem to them proper and also directed them that they could not infer the contrary of a statement in evidence merely because they rejected it. 
    18   In my view, there was ample evidence that the appellant was and was known as ""John-Boy"". Mr. Rayner's evidence of knowledge of the appellant, even though he was drunk on the occasion, was unlikely to be mistaken and was capable of being regarded as compelling by the jury. 
    19   In the light of the appellant's admissions of his own nickname and associates, the evidence that it was ""John-Boy"" who entered on both and the second occasion, the evidence was such overall that I do not consider there is a significant possibility that an innocent person had been convicted. I do not consider that the jury should not have found the appellant guilty on both counts. 
    20   I would therefore propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
    21   DUNFORD, J: I agree. 
    22   SMART, AJ: I also agree.  
    23   DUNFORD, J: The order of the court will therefore be that the appeal be dismissed.

       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
     
     
     1 SMART AJ:  
     Hakija Sinanovic has applied for leave to appeal against interlocutory orders made by Shillington DCJ on 21 August 1998, Blanch DCCJ on 18 September 1998, Graham DCJ on 10 December 1998 and Mahoney DCJ on 1 April 1999. 
      
     2 In 1998 the applicant stood charged on two indictments, each containing two counts. One indictment charged that he on 14 July 1995 dishonestly obtained for himself a valuable thing, namely, a cheque for $7000 by deception by representing that Brazilian cruzeiros were the current legal tender of Brazil and as such were able to be exchanged for other currencies.  
      
     3 The second count alleged that between 13 July 1995 and 18 July 1995 the applicant dishonestly obtained a cheque for $1000 and a cheque for $4000 by deception by a representation to the same effect. 
      
     4 The other indictment alleged that on 11 December 1995 the applicant dishonestly obtained a diamond ring by deception by representing that he would that day deposit into the bank account of Stefano Designer Jewellery Pty Limited a cheque for $27,000. 
      
     5 The applicant was charged in the alternative that between 11 December 1995 and 12 January 1996 being the bailee of a diamond ring, the property of Stefano Designer Jewellery Pty Limited, did fraudulently convert that property to his own use. 
      
     6 The applicant stood trial on the latter indictment relating to the diamond ring commencing in January 1999 and was convicted. An appeal against conviction and sentence is pending. 
      
     7 The trial on the other indictment, which was to follow, was not reached. That trial is now listed to begin on 21 June 1999. 
      
     8 Mrs Sinanovic, who has appeared in this Court to urge the case on behalf of the appellant, has furnished a detailed chronology. Her approach was to suggest that there had been an abuse of process from an early stage beginning with the refusal of a magistrate to require a witness to attend to give oral evidence pursuant to s.48E of the Justices Acts, 1902. That abuse, she contends, was continued on 5 September 1997 when Shillington DCJ proceeded with the indictment of her husband, notwithstanding that there was pending before the Administrative Law Division of this Court, a challenge to the Magistrate's ruling. This point lacks substance. 
      
     9 Mrs Sinanovic has traced the history of the matter so far as she regards it as relevant to these proceedings. She has submitted that nobody has stopped the abuse of process. She has also emphasised that she has a comprehensive knowledge of all her husband's matters, and that no one else has such knowledge. 
      
     10 It was apparent from the lengthy submissions which she has addressed to this Court that her knowledge of her husband's matters, including what he might wish to put in defence and what could be put in defence, is extensive. 
      
     11 Mrs Sinanovic has complained that the prosecuting authorities have not complied with various recommendations made by judges of the District Court. She has further complained that the access granted to her by the Corrective Services Department, not by way of contact visits but by way of legal visits to her husband in gaol, has been unduly and unfairly restricted to such an extent that the applicant has been deprived of the opportunity of putting his case fully and fairly. She has stressed the course taken by Brennan CJ in the High Court and Hunt CJ at CL in this Court, in making strong recommendations as to the granting of legal access. Those senior judges were concerned that the applicant should not be disadvantaged by the failure to be able to put his case fully and that there were substantial reasons why he needed the assistance of his wife. 
      
     12 Those reasons include, amongst other things, not only her comprehensive knowledge, but also his stated inability to read and write English so that he is in considerable difficulty responding to requests for written instructions. It would also deprive him of the opportunity of going through the necessary documents in matters which are quite wide ranging.  
      
     13 Whilst Mrs Sinanovic has dealt with the history of the matter at length, what I have summarised is sufficient for the purposes of the applications before this Court. It is appropriate to turn to the four applications that are made to this Court for leave to appeal. 
      
     14 On 21 August 1998 Shillington DCJ dismissed an application seeking an order that the applicant remain in custody in Sydney on the basis that the Court had no power to direct where the applicant should be held in custody. The applicant was then due to stand trial on 2 November 1998 and wanted to remain in Sydney to prepare for that trial. He asserted that he needed a place where he could work effectively and consult with his wife. The applicant told the judge that he could not read and write and required the assistance of his wife to go through all the papers. The applicant's solicitor, who happened to be present in court, but not appearing for the applicant on that occasion, told the Court that the applicant was not happy with the proposed arrangements for communicating his instructions to her. The applicant and his wife regarded the charges as involving matters of some complexity.  
      
     15 The Crown has informed this Court that the applicant has remained in custody in Sydney from 4 June 1998 to date. The applicant and his wife recall him being sent to and from Junee on a number of occasions and were unable to confirm that date. But as I understood it from them, since at least Christmas 1998 he has been in custody in Sydney. The probabilities are that the departmental records are correct and that, despite talk of moving the applicant to Junee, he has not in fact been moved there from Sydney since June 1998.  
      
     16 Neither the District Court nor this Court has power to direct where a person is to be held, or to control the legal access which is to be granted to him.  
      
     17 On 18 September 1998 Blanch DCCJ dismissed for the same reason a second application. 
      
     18 A trial date of 2 November 1998 was vacated and the trials were scheduled to commence on 4 January 1999. On 10 December 1998 Graham DCJ dismissed an application that the applicant's trials scheduled to commence on 4 January 1999 be stayed as an abuse of process. It was intended that the two trials be run sequentially. 
      
     19 The application came before Graham DCJ on 20 November 1998 when the judge spent some time listening to the applicant and his wife and endeavouring to sort the matter out. On 10 December 1998 Graham DCJ spent considerable time hearing the application. The transcript extends over 34 pages and there was documentary material which required and received the judge's attention. The judge delivered a judgment of eight pages. 
      
     20 The applicant's recorded submissions were quite lengthy. Graham DCJ gave careful consideration to the matters raised, including some documents being unavailable. The judge thought, correctly, that none of the problems which were raised, either alone or in combination, warranted the granting of a stay. He gave directions as to the provision of documents to the applicant. 
      
     21 In late March 1999, after the applicant had been sentenced on the diamond ring offence, application was made by the applicant to  
     ""move the Court to a hearing in respect of (1) Abuse of human rights and (2) Abuse of process."" 
      
     22 On that application, which was heard on 1 April, 1999 Mr Sinanovic appeared for himself. We have been told that he had no affidavit in support, and that Judge Mahoney declined to allow him to give oral evidence. It seems that the applicant had been told that he was about to be moved to Junee and that at the hearing attention was directed to the applicant being kept in Sydney until his trial commenced on the currency matters on 21 June 1999. The Department of Corrective Services was proposing to move the applicant to Junee on 24 April 1999.  
      
     23 It seems that the applicant told the judge he wanted to be able to remain in Sydney so he could have many visits from his wife so she could read to him the multitude of documents to be considered in preparing for his trial. The judge found it hard to accept that the applicant was unable to read and understand what had been written in English. The judge noted that in the past six months the applicant had had 51 legal visitations. Mr Sinanovic gave an explanation about these to this Court. The judge thought that the period from 1 to 24 April gave the applicant's solicitors adequate time to consult with him at Long Bay or Silverwater. The judge ruled that the allegations of abuse of human rights and an abuse of process, involved an over statement of the position. No stay was granted.  
      
     24 In this Court complaint was made as to the judge's refusal to allow the applicant to give oral evidence and his alleged failure to listen fully to the claim of abuse of process. The applications filed have not necessarily been couched in terms in respect of which legal relief could be given. It was not made clear in the motion filed before Mahoney DCJ that a stay was being sought.  
      
     25 In the written submissions of Mrs Sinanovic, the grounds of appeal have been stated or summarised thus: "" 
     Abuse of process, equality and discrimination; common law right not to be tried unfairly; adequate time and facilities to prepare; denial of natural justice.""  
      
     26 The applicant's wife asserts on his behalf that he is presently in custody as a result of wrongly being found guilty of a number of offences by gross miscarriages of justice. He has appealed against all convictions. She has complained that the trial listed to start on 4 January 1999, and actually starting on 6 January 1999, was forced on in circumstances where the applicant had insufficient knowledge of the Crown brief, and his case had not been thoroughly prepared. 
      
     27 As the trial on the diamond ring matters has been concluded, it is not appropriate, or indeed open to this Court, to make any orders in relation to that matter on these applications. The background that I have narrated only bears upon the forthcoming trial.  
      
      28 In her written submissions the applicant's wife has summarised the matters upon which she relies, thus: 
      
       
        
         
         ""1. He is in custody. 
          
          
         2. His place of classification is Junee Correctional Centre. 
          
          
         3. All his matters are in Sydney. 
          
          
         4. He cannot read or write in English. 
          
          
         5. He has been denied his common right to time and facilities to prepare for his trial and other court matters, including appeals. 
          
          
         6. His position before the Court is crippled. 
          
          
         7. He is discriminated and faces prejudice because of his handicap (cannot read or write English). 
          
          
         8. He is refused to be listened to (bias from certain judicial officers). 
          
          
         9. He faces courts not having any knowledge of contents of documentation thus denying his 'natural justice'. 
          
          
         10. All his court procedures have been 'abuses of process'. 
          
          
         11. He has been refused legal access to Mrs M A Sinanovic who has been legally assisting and representing the appellant and has knowledge of the fine details of all the appellant's court matters. 
          
          
         12. The DPP always fails to comply with the rules and orders in respect of producing all relevant documentation with proper adequate notice to the appellant in respect of his trials."" 
         
        
       
       
      
     29 Mrs Sinanovic has elaborated upon those submissions in oral argument relevant to the forthcoming trial. She has asserted that her right to legal access was terminated on the transfer of her husband to the MMTC Long Bay complex shortly after September 1998. Since that date she has only had contact visits. Two contact visits a week are allowed and papers and documents may not be taken on those contact visits. If she has legal access, then an area having some privacy is provided, as well as a table and chairs, and she and her husband can work through and prepare for the forthcoming trial. 
      
     30 Mrs Sinanovic has also complained about any move to Junee. On 14 May 1999, in a further application to the District Court, Woods DCJ noted: 
      
       
        
         
         ""1. Accused should be kept in custody in Sydney pending trial on 21 June 1999 so legal preparation for his defence may proceed. If the preparation of his case is made impractical the trial date may be jeopardised. 
          
          
         2. Solicitors and counsel are properly briefed at the trial. They are the persons who should confer with him. 
          
          
         3. It is likely that if the accused changes solicitors or counsel he would lose legal aid. If this occurred it should not be a basis for adjournment of the trial."" 
         
        
       
       
      
     31 I should also have recorded that there was an application heard before Armitage DCJ on 30 April 1999.  
      
     32 It is important that the applicant's wife have legal visits to the applicant and I would experience disquiet if that did not happen. It may lead to the trial on 21 June 1999 not proceeding. This is not a case in which the applicant should be restricted to contact with his legal advisers. We were reminded of the practicalities of legal aid and that only a very limited number of conferences are allowed in the sense that only a limited number are paid for. This would seem to be a case where the conferences needed might be extensive, and there is substance in the view that to obtain a fair trial, that is one in which the applicant's case is thoroughly and fully prepared, his wife needs to have legal access.  
      
     33 I do not think that this Court should accede to the request to treat these applications as applications to this Court for a stay of the proceedings. For my part I think that leave to appeal should be refused in respect of each of the applications. However, if the applicant is not able to prepare sufficiently thoroughly for his trial, and I doubt that he can do that without the assistance of his wife, then an adjournment would have to be granted and, if the refusal of access persists, it may be that the District Court would have to entertain an application for a stay.  
      
     34 The formal order which I would propose in each matter is that leave to appeal be refused. More important are the comments which have been made as to the future conduct in respect of the forthcoming trial. 
      
     35 LEVINE J 
     : I agree with the orders proposed by Smart AJ and with his comments as to the further conduct of this matter. 
      
     36 I, for myself, add that it could hardly be necessary to state that it is desirable in everyone's and every institution's interest that finality be reached in proceedings involving the applicant. It also should be remarked that nothing should imperil the fair trial listed to be heard by anything failed to be done by authorities or, indeed, anything done or failed to be done by those who represent the interests of the applicant. 
      
     37 GREG JAMES J 
     : I agree with the orders proposed. I agree with the reasons given by Smart AJ. I endorse the comments and adopt them. I adopt the comments also of Levine J presiding. I would emphasise that it is in the community's interests that this trial be permitted to proceed without impediment. 
      
     38 LEVINE J 
     : The orders of the Court will therefore be as proposed by Smart AJ.

    19 MAY 1999 
     
     R v Jean Vincent Didier GOVINDEN 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    DUNFORD J. This is a Crown appeal on the ground of inadequacy against the sentences imposed on the respondent following his pleas of guilty to charges of accessory after the fact to armed robbery and robbery in company, both contrary to section 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, which provides for maximum penalties of 14 years and 20 years penal servitude respectively.2    In respect of the charge of accessory after the fact to armed robbery, and taking into account a further matter on a Form 2 of possess a shortened firearm, her Honour Judge Ainslie-Wallace deferred entering a conviction, on the respondent entering into a recognisance himself in the sum of $500 to be of good behaviour for two years with provision for supervision and psychotherapy.3    On the charge of robbery in company, her Honour sentenced the respondent to 200 hours community service, of which 50 hours was to be spent at an attendance centre. The sentences were imposed on 8 December 1998 and the Director's Notice of Appeal was signed on 22 December and served personally on the respondent on 23 December.4    The facts giving rise to the two matters may be shortly stated as follows. On 14 March 1998 one Yann Legrand robbed a Pizza Hut takeaway store at Woodcroft using a shortened firearm. He was questioned, arrested and charged with armed robbery on 27 March and in the course of the interview he made full admissions and revealed that the firearm used in the offence had been left by him at the respondent's residence. Police attended with a search warrant, the weapon was recovered, and consequently the respondent attended Blacktown Police Station in company with his father. 5    He made full admissions and was arrested and charged with the first offence. He admitted in particular that he had been minding the gun for Yann Legrand, as the latter was worried that his parents or the police might find out, that he knew the gun had been used in the robbery, that robbery was an offence, and that the gun was illegal. He was released on bail.6    On 16 April 1998 at about 8.50 pm he went with three juveniles, Ricky Pass, Tony Issa and Mathew Bonney, to the vicinity of the Dost Market Food Store at Blacktown. Issa and Bonney remained in Bonney's vehicle whilst Pass and the respondent entered the store wearing balaclavas over their heads. Issa carried a replica pistol (actually a toy water pistol) and the respondent a sports bag. They approached the co-owner of the business, a Mr Izci, and Pass produced the replica pistol and demanded that Mr Izci give them money, whereupon the respondent held the bag open to receive it. Ultimately, they decamped with approximately $3,000. They ran out of the shop and down a laneway to the waiting vehicle, and Bonney drove them from the scene.7    Subsequently, Bonney was arrested and interviewed. He described the person who accompanied Pass to the shop, whose name he did not know. The respondent attended Blacktown Police Station in company with his solicitor and declined to answer questions but agreed to participate in an identification parade, at which Bonney subsequently identified him. 8    He was again interviewed and again declined to answer any questions and was again charged. The respondent gave evidence at the sentence proceedings that he received no payment for the accessory offence and only $40 for the armed robbery offence.9    He further said that in relation to the latter offence he had been telephoned by Ricky Pass, whom he knew from school and who had asked him if he was interested in doing an armed robbery, to which he had replied ""No"". Pass phoned back later and invited the respondent to play pool with a few friends. He agreed to do this, but said that when he arrived at Pass' home Pass again suggested doing a robbery and the respondent, in the company of Issa and Bonney, agreed.10    The respondent was born on 4 September 1979 and was accordingly aged approximately 18 years at the time of the commission of the two offences, and is now aged 19 years. He was born in Mauritius and came to Australia in 1988. His father teaches English as a second language at a high school and his mother is a high school teacher/librarian. He has an older sister and a younger brother and the evidence was that he lives in a stable family environment.11    In junior high school he was apparently a good student and an excellent basketball player, but in Year 10, in 1995, he sustained an injury to his left knee necessitating a knee reconstruction in October 1995, which brought an end to his prospects of any future career or enjoyment of basketball. At about this time the family moved house and the respondent changed schools for Year 11.12    During Year 11 he was introduced to drugs, apparently marijuana, which he began to use in an experimental fashion at weekend parties, but it escalated to smoking on a daily basis and in addition his use of marijuana was partly to alleviate his depression at not being able to play basketball. This drug use led to truanting and it affected his grades at school.13    During Year 12 he spoke to the school counsellor, was referred for drug counselling, and he ceased using marijuana in mid to late 1997. But by this time he was behind in his studies and he did not sit for his Higher School Certificate at the end of Year 12 in 1997 because he felt he had not studied enough.14    At the beginning of 1998 he again changed schools, with a view to repeating Year 12. As a new boy in a new school he was in a situation of making new friends. Unfortunately, he seems to have chosen the wrong ones. It was his association with new acquaintances at the new school that led to his involvement in these offences.15    Following his arrest in March 1998 for the accessory offence, he resumed using marijuana, but the evidence is that after the arrest for the robbery he has not used it.16    Particularly after his arrest he applied himself more enthusiastically to his studies and achieved good results in the half-yearly report in 1998. He topped the class in 2-Unit Mathematics in Society and Legal Studies. At the same time he was third out of a class of twenty in Modern History and fourth out of a class of forty-four in 2-Unit General English. He was also first out of two in French and third out of twenty-six in General Studies. However, the French result may be largely due to his background and the fact that I presume it was the primary language used at home.17    He gave evidence expressing his remorse for the offences, particularly for the trouble caused to his family and the trauma caused to the shopkeeper, and said he no longer associated with his co-offenders from either of the offences. His evidence was corroborated so far as is relevant by his father.18    Yann Legrand, the principal in the accessory offence, was dealt with by his Honour Judge Dodd in the District Court in respect of two armed robberies, including the one at the Pizza Hut at Woodcroft. In respect of each matter sentence was deferred on his entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of three years, the recognisance to be subject to certain conditions. 
    19    The other persons involved in the robbery of Mr Izci were dealt with in the Children's Court. Ricky Pass, the person who actually carried out the robbery with the respondent and carried the replica pistol, was ordered to perform 200 hours community service and ordered to participate in counselling. Issa was dealt with for receiving and conceal serious offence and was placed on a 12 months good behaviour bond. Bonney was sentenced as an accessory after the fact to armed robbery and placed on probation for 18 months.20    Although her Honour recognised the authorities to the effect that, except in the most exceptional circumstances, persons who commit armed robberies should receive sentences involving at least some period of full-time custody, she considered that in all the circumstances, having regard in particular to the respondent's excellent prospects of rehabilitation, that this was one of those exceptional cases and imposed the sentences to which I have referred.21    This Court has on many occasions emphasised the seriousness of the offence of armed robbery: R v Readman (1990) 47 A Crim R 181 at 184-5, an offence for which Parliament has prescribed a maximum penalty of twenty years. With these matters in mind, the Court has further said that, save in exceptional circumstances, persons who commit this offence must receive full-time custodial sentences: eg, R v Roberts (1994) 73 A Crim R 306, R v Maddocks (CCA - unreported - 25 November 1993), R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48.22    This principle has now been authoritatively restated by a Bench of five members of this Court in the guideline judgment of R v Henry and Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111, particularly at [113]. 23    A matter of particular concern in the present case is that the armed robbery in company offence was committed whilst the respondent was on bail for the accessory after the fact and the possess firearm offences, and the courts have said many times that persons who commit further offences whilst on bail, which is a form of conditional liberty, should receive ""severely deterrent"" sentences for such offences: R v Richards (1981) 2 NSWLR 464.24    Not only is it necessary to have regard to this principle of sentencing in the present case, but the commission of the armed robbery in company after being interviewed, charged and released on bail for the accessory offence, makes it very difficult to accept the submission that the armed robbery in company was a one-off incident committed at the prompting of others, possibly as a fresh experience or youthful prank, with a sense of bravado or risk-taking, the seriousness of which was not realised. After being charged with the first offence, this respondent must have realised that anything remotely resembling armed robbery was to be avoided at all costs and that involvement in such an enterprise could put his liberty at jeopardy.  
    25    Another aggravating factor in the offence was that the victim was particularly vulnerable, being the proprietor of a small general store doing business at night. R v Tocknell (CCA - unreported - 28 May 1998).26    On behalf of the Crown, our attention was drawn, firstly, to a number of what was said to be aggravating factors present in this case; namely, that the offence was planned and premeditated; the victim was particularly vulnerable, being the proprietor of a small general store; both robbers wore balaclavas; the proceeds of the robbery were substantial, being over $3000 and the offence was committed whilst on bail. I have already dealt with the vulnerability of the victim and the fact that the offences were committed whilst on bail.27    Although there was some degree of planning, as I suspect there must be for any armed robbery, it appears to have been cursory and only involving a matter of hours before it was carried out. The wearing of balaclavas or taking whatever money can be located are not really unusual features to armed robberies, but are factors which make the offence objectively serious in every case.28    In relation to the matters which the Judge found amounted to exceptional circumstances, there were the respondent's youth, his previous good character, his prospects of rehabilitation and the question of parity. Matters that were not specifically referred to in her Honour's Remarks on Sentencing but which were also relevant included the destruction of his sporting ability and his difficulty in coping with that, the change of school and the search for new friends in his new environment. There was convincing evidence of the respondent's prospects of rehabilitation, as demonstrated by his subsequent progress at school, progression to university and the various reports that were available before her Honour.29    I turn now to consider the other two matters of his youth and the question of parity with his co-offenders. It is well-recognised that in dealing with young offenders, questions of general deterrence are of less importance than in the case of older offenders and the rehabilitation of the offender is given a greater significance. This principle has recently been reaffirmed in R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [9 - 10], one of the cases dealt with at the time of the guideline judgment of R v Henry earlier referred to. See also R v Tocknell supra and R v Farah (CCA - unreported - 11 December 1998). But this respondent was aged 18½ when the offences were committed and the principle is more commonly applied to offenders younger than that, and it is not applied to offenders who commit crimes of the nature normally committed by adults, such as armed robbery: see R v Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 129 at 135 referred to in R v Tran at [10-11].  
    30    In Maddocks, a case which bears some similarity to the present case although the respondent was a couple of years older, the Court found that otherwise similar circumstances to this did not amount to the ""most exceptional"" circumstances which would justify a non-custodial sentence, although in the exercise of its discretion the Court decided not to interfere in view of the progress in rehabilitation that had been made since the respondent had been dealt with in the District Court. 
    31    Another important case in this regard is R v Lattouf (CCA - unreported - 12 December 1996) which was another armed robbery case. It was also a Crown appeal and the respondent was a single man aged nineteen residing with his family, which was described as warm and caring, and he had a good record of employment. 
    32    In giving judgment, Mahoney ACJ, reaffirmed the seriousness with which this Court treats armed robbery and he reiterated that it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that a non-custodial sentence will be imposed. 
    33    He pointed out that there is a public interest in the adoption and articulation of sentencing principles which will deter the commission of serious crime and punish those who commit it. But his Honour went on to refer to the paramount objective of achieving justice in the individual case and said at 7-8: 
     
      
       
       ""But, in addition, a sentencing process must be capable of discriminating between cases. There is, as I have said, a public interest in punishment. But if the desire to punish results in a person who would otherwise not become a confirmed criminal becoming such, that sentencing process is inconsistent with the public interest. It has to be recognised that imprisonment may convert a person who will not be a persistent criminal into one who is. Particularly this is so where the person to be sentenced is a first offender of a comparatively young age whose family circumstances are such that he may, with assistance, not become a criminal. It would be wrong to the individual and costly to the community not to attempt the rehabilitation of such a person."" 
       
      
      
    34    The appeal was dismissed, although the judgments of the different members of the Court reflected some variation in thinking as to how that result should be achieved. 
    35    Sentencing judges must be vigilant to ensure that they do not accept uncritically at face value all submissions to the effect that the person standing for sentence is ""at the cross-roads"", ""has seen the error of his ways"", ""is at a turning point in his life"", or ""has excellent prospects of rehabilitation."" Often such submissions have no justification in fact and are based on no more than wishful thinking, but there are exceptional cases where such submissions do have validity and the Court should be astute to recognise them. I believe this is such a case, even though, unlike Mr Lattouf, this respondent was not a first offender at the time of the commission of the more serious offence. 
    36    The other matter is the question of parity. These principles are not normally relevant to offenders who are dealt with under different regimes, as was the case here, the other offenders being dealt with in the Children's Court, but the sentences imposed on them are not, for that reason, entirely irrelevant: R v Broad (CCA - unreported - 13 March 1984) per Street CJ at 3. 
    37    However, when one looks at the sentences imposed on the other persons, one might see how this respondent, if sentenced to full-time custody, could be left with a justifiable sense of grievance: see Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301. True it is that he was older than Pass, and true it is, it was not his first offence and he was on bail for the earlier offence at the time, but he does not appear to have been the instigator of the offence and it is not therefore irrelevant, in my view, to have regard to the sentence imposed on Mr Pass.  
    38    The respondent was about a year older than his co-offenders, but they were classmates at school and, having recently moved to the new school, the respondent was seeking new friends. Notwithstanding that the others were dealt with in the Children's Court under a different regime, it would be, in my view, difficult to justify a full-time custodial sentence in an adult gaol for this respondent, when whoever was apparently the instigator of the offence received a non-custodial sentence.  
    39    There was a lot of material before her Honour indicating positive prospects of rehabilitation, and although the weapon was intended to, and no doubt did, strike fear and terror into the victim, it was only a replica and there was therefore no prospect of the victim suffering any sort of gunshot wound. 
    40    Notwithstanding that the applicant was on bail at the time, her Honour was confronted with the stark choice between permitting the respondent to proceed to university in circumstances where the evidence indicated he was unlikely to offend again, and sending him to gaol, which is commonly referred to as the ""university of crime"".  
    41    Although this is very much a borderline case, for these reasons I consider the case is within the ""most exceptional"" type of case where a full-time custodial sentence was not necessary. 
    42    I should say, however, that even accepting that a non full-time custodial sentence was appropriate, I still regard the sentence as excessively lenient. For myself, I see no reason why, if a non full-time custodial sentence was appropriate, that in lieu of a community service order he should not have been sentenced to a lengthy period of periodic detention - say up to three years. But, in all the circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the Crown does not press any increase in a non-custodial sentence, the main issue, full-time custody or not, having been resolved in favour of the respondent, and having regard to his progress since he was sentenced, as disclosed by the affidavits that have been filed in Court today, I consider that the Court should not otherwise vary the sentence but, in the exercise of its discretion, dismiss the Crown appeal, and I so propose. 
    43    GREG JAMES J: I agree, and I agree with the reasons given by the presiding Judge for the order he has proposed.  
    44    SMART AJ: I also agree. 
    45    DUNFORD J: The order will therefore be that the Crown appeal is dismissed.

     R v Frederick Alvin DELK 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1    SMART AJ: Frederick Alvin Delk appeals against his conviction of a charge, tried by a judge alone, that he, Delk, on 20 February 1998, did steal certain property, to wit, one platinum and diamond wristwatch, one platinum and diamond brooch, and one platinum, diamond and sapphire bracelet, the property of John T. Hinkley Pty Limited, from the person of Geoffrey Kenneth Goldthorp, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, immediately after the stealing, maliciously, did inflict actual bodily harm on Geoffrey Kenneth Goldthorp. 
    2    On 19th February 1998 the appellant visited the company’s shop at 172 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, and spent about 30 minutes there looking at pieces of jewellery. The company sold expensive jewellery. The door to the shop is kept locked and potential customers are admitted only after a member of the staff causes the door to open. On 19 February 1998 the appellant and a saleswoman negotiated a sale price of $183,000 for the three pieces of jewellery. 
    3    About 11.15 am on 20 February 1998 the appellant entered the shop and asked Mr Goldthorp, a salesman, if he could look at the pieces of jewellery again. The appellant was seated on a stool on one side of a glass counter. Mr Goldthorp retrieved the pieces from the window and placed them on a tray on the counter in front of the appellant. Mr Goldthorp remained standing. The appellant asked Mr Goldthorp for the weight of the stones. Mr Goldthorp went to obtain a certificate with the details, temporarily placing the pieces out of the appellant's reach as he did so. On obtaining the certificate he placed the pieces on the counter in front of the appellant. There was a short conversation. 
    4    The appellant while still seated and with Mr Goldthorp opposite him, and close to him, lunged across the counter and with one arm grabbed the pieces and pulled them towards his body. At the same time he leant over the counter and with his other arm reached for the key to release the door. Mr Goldthorp moved to the appellant's side of the counter and grabbed the appellant by the throat. During the ensuing struggle the appellant punched Mr Goldthorp about the forehead causing a number of injuries which constituted actual bodily harm. The appellant escaped from the shop but he was pursued and apprehended. The jewellery was recovered from his person. 
    5    At the trial there was no issue that the appellant had stolen the company's jewellery and that immediately after the theft the appellant had maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on Mr Goldthorp. The issue is whether the appellant had stolen the jewellery from the person of Mr Goldthorp. The appellant contended that the property had to be taken from the actual person of Mr Goldthorp and that it was not sufficient that it was taken from his immediate presence. The judge rejected the appellant's argument. 
    6    The appellant contended that the starting point should be s 95 of the Crimes Act 1900 which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
       (1) Whosoever robs or assaults with intent to rob any person, or steals any chattel, money or valuable security from the person of another in circumstances of aggravation, shall be liable to penal servitude for twenty years. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) In this section, ""circumstances of aggravation"" means circumstances that (immediately before, or at the time of, or immediately after the robbery, assault or larceny) involve anyone or more of the following: 
       
      
      
      . . . 
      
      
       
        (b) the alleged offender maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm on any person 
       
      
      . . . 
      
      
    7    Section 94(1) which deals with robbery without circumstances of aggravation is in similar terms to section 95(1) except that it does not refer to circumstances of aggravation and the maximum penalty is penal servitude for fourteen years. 
    8    The appellant contends that the ordinary and natural meaning of the words, ""steals from the person"" is that the items stolen must be held by the person, for example, a handbag or in a person's pocket or clothes, for example, a wallet in a pocket, or be worn by a person, for example, a ring or a necklace or an earring. 
    9    These are but examples on the appellant's approach. On his approach, if Mr Goldthorp held the brooch in his hand and so showed it to the appellant and he seized the brooch and made off, that would be stealing from the person. However, if Mr Goldthorp placed it on the counter or in a tray on the counter and stood beside the counter and the appellant seized the brooch and made off, that would not be stealing from the person, but stealing. On this approach, the offence committed would depend on whether Mr Goldthorp was holding the brooch or had placed it on the counter. That seems a little artificial. What would be the situation, for example, if Mr Goldthorp had held the tray with the pieces of jewellery and the appellant had seized them off the tray? 
    10    The appellant submitted that it was erroneous to apply the law developed in relation to robbery to the offence of stealing from the person. He contended that that offence had a different genesis and was designed to strike at different conduct. Violence was not involved in stealing from the person. 
    11    The major Australian authority is that of the Full Court of South Australia in Regina v Stewart and Ors [1929] SASR 500. That court embarked upon an historical review of the law of robbery and steal from the person at pages 502 to 505. 
    12    After reviewing the Statutes of 8 Eliz C 4, 48 Geo III, C 129, 7 and 8 Geo IV C 29, 7 Guil IV and 1 Vict 1 (1837) (which was adopted in South Australia (Ord 5 Vic No 14) and 24 and 25 Vic C 96 and the South Australian Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1870 Napier J, at 505, on behalf of the Court continued: 
     
      
       
       "" The plain effect of these Statutes, commencing with 48 Geo 111 C 129 is to deal with all larcenies from the person, whether committed openly or privily, and thus to close the gap between robbery and larceny from the person; later (in 1827) to deal with robbery and other larcenies from the person as one offence - i.e. for the purposes of punishment; and finally, to leave simple robbery and larceny from the person to stand in this way as one offence, while prescribing heavier punishment for aggravated forms of robbery. We see no reason why these words, ""from the person"" when used in these Statutes should not be expounded as the law had already expounded them for the purposes of the indictment for robbery, which had already been regarded as a form of larceny from the person aggravated by the circumstance of force or putting in fear... The evolution of the Statute law is opposed to any subtle distinction between the meaning of these words as they are used in the one context or the other."" 
       
      
      
    13    The Court upheld the ruling at the trial that for the purpose of the statutory offence of stealing from the person a taking in the person's presence was sufficient. In that case a bank teller was sorting notes on the counter in front of him when the accused entered the bank. The teller placed the notes on a shelf under the counter in front of him. One of the thieves took them. There was the same close presence and guarding as in the present case. Stewart has stood unchallenged for many years. 
    14    In Smith v Desmond [1965] AC 960 the House of Lords reviewed the law of robbery. At 993 Lord Pearce pointed out that in 1827 all the old Statutes dealing with theft, robbery and related matters were swept away and that in 1837 a more orderly and coherent attempt was made to define the sentences and ingredients of various crimes. He explained that robbery was an aggravated form of theft, adding an offence against the person to the offence of stealing, since the theft is carried out by using violence to the person from whose possession the goods are stolen or by putting him in fear of violence. Lord Pearce said at 993 to 994, 
     
      
       
       ""The simplest case of robbery is that where the property is stolen, by violence or putting in fear, from the actual person of the victim... Owing to the essentially personal nature of the crime, the indictment always used to allege that the goods were stolen 'a persona'. 
       
      
      
       
       Nevertheless, from early times the crime was constructively extended to cover cases where the goods were not actually stolen from the victim's person. The real nature of the crime, stealing by violence, was the same whether the goods were on the victim's person or in his presence."" 
       
      
      
    15    I interpolate that the crime of stealing from the person involves a personal confrontation and the potential for personal conflict and force or fear, particularly if the victim endeavours to stop the theft. In such circumstances it matters not whether the property stolen is on the person of the victim or in his immediate presence. It is unnecessary in this case to elaborate on what satisfies the requirement of the person's immediate presence. It certainly embraces a case such as this where the victim is standing beside the property and guarding it.16    At 996 Lord Pearce said:  
     
      
       
       ""In  
       Clements v State 
         
       the Supreme Court of Georgia held that there was sufficient taking in the presence of a man whose house was rifled and cash stolen from it while he was confined by force in a shed 15 yards from the house. The learned judge there said that ""all his property, so far as cases of this character are concerned, is, in contemplation of law, upon the person of the owner, which is, at the time of taking, in the immediate presence of the owner or is so near at hand, or stored in such a position, that at the time of taking, it is under the immediate personal protection of the owner."" He quoted from Bishop on the Criminal Law, Vol. 2 paras 1177, 1178. The meaning of this legal phrase is not that the taking must necessarily be from the actual contact of the body, but if it is from under the personal protection that will suffice. Within that doctrine the person may be deemed to protect all things belonging to the individual, within a distance not easily defined, over which the influence of the personal presence extends.""  
       
      
      
     I agree. 
      
    17    At 998 Lord Pearce remarked: 
     
      
       
       ""But the offence can only exist where the victim has sufficient care or personal possession of the goods to allow the Court to say that constructively the goods were taken in his presence."" 
       
      
      
    18    At 999 Lord Pearce stated that it was a question of degree for the jury to decide whether the victim of the violence was sufficiently the custodian of the stolen property, whether he had sufficient possession and care of it, to constitute the stealing as being in his presence. 
    19    The speech of Lord Morris also contains an illuminating historical review. At 979 he said: 
     
      
       
       ""There is little doubt that the writings and decisions in regard to robbery reveal a continuous and progressive process of definition."" 
       
      
      
    20    He traced that progression from early times when the offence of robbery was limited to cases where there was actual violence to a person and a forcible taking from the person to the present when actual violence is not necessary, and when it suffices if there is a putting in fear of violence by a threat of violence or by other means. He said, 
     
      
       
       ""Furthermore, the taking may not have been literally a taking from the person. It could be a taking of goods, against the will, either from the person of another or in his presence."" 
       
      
      
    21    I see no good reason why the offence of stealing from the person should not be similarly approached. The offence of stealing from the person fills what would otherwise be a gap in the law as it exists in New South Wales. The taking of goods from a person or from his immediate presence when he has sufficient possession and care of it invites a personal confrontation and steps in prevention which will often involve breaches of the peace in the struggle which ensues. 
    22    In the present case and, indeed, in Stewart, the taking was comparable to a taking from the person. The jewellery here in question was in the immediate and personal presence, care and protection of Mr Goldthorp and that suffices. 
    23    In the Queen v Foster (1995) 78 ACR 517 at 522 this Court followed Smith v Desmond and stated: 
     
      
       
       ""The essence of a robbery is that violence is done or threatened to the person of the owner or custodian who stands between the offender and the property stolen, in order to overcome that person's resistance and so to oblige him to part with the property; in other words, the victim must be compelled by force or fear to submit to the theft:  
         
       Smith v Desmond 
        [1965] AC 960 at 985-987, 997-998; (1965) 49 Cr App R 246 at 260-263, 275-276. It is not sufficient that the threat of violence is made after the property has been taken; both elements of the offence must coincide: Emery (1975) 11 SASR 169 at 173."" 
       
      
      
    24    It is important to pay particular attention to the history of the offence of steal from the person in New South Wales: 
     
     Act 46 Vic No 17 was stated to be an Act to consolidate and amend in certain respects the criminal law. Sections 90 and 91 provide: 
      
       
       ""90. Whosoever robs or assaults with intent to rob any person or steals any chattel money or valuable security from the person of another shall unless where a greater punishment is provided by this Act be liable to penal servitude for ten years. 
       
      
      
       
       91. Whosoever commits any such felony as is mentioned in the last preceding section and immediately before or at the time of or immediately after the commission thereof strikes or uses any other corporal violence to any person shall be liable to penal servitude for fourteen years. And if the person so offending thereby wounds any person he shall be liable to penal servitude for life."" 
       
      
      
    25    It will be seen that the offences of robbery, assault with intent to rob and steal from the person are dealt with together and the same maximum penalty is prescribed for each. These offences are seen as part of an overall scheme dealing with the graver thefts where there is violence or putting in fear or the potential for violence exist. The statutory scheme manifest in the 1883 Act was continued in the Crimes Act 1900 and is reflected in the current sections 94 and 95 of that Act. 
    26    It would be anomalous in such a statutory scheme, given the development of the concept of robbery, for the offence of steal from the person not to include a taking of goods in the possession, care, custodianship and immediate presence of the victim. 
    27    The English Larceny Act 1916 deals with stealing from the person separately from the offences of robbery and assault with intent to rob. The English Theft Act 1968 represents a major departure from previous statutory regimes. Caution must therefore be exercised when reference is made to the current English legislation. However, in New South Wales the history and the scheme of the legislation are clear. The judge was right. The appeal should be dismissed. 
    28    DUNFORD J:  I agree with the judgment of Smart AJ and with his Honour's reasons, and only wish to add this. R v Stewart [1929] SASR 500, which appears to be the only Australian authority in point, and which is based on legislation and a legislative history similar to that of New South Wales has stood now for almost 70 years, and in my view should be followed. Not only do I consider its reasoning to be correct, but such reasoning is consistent with the reasoning of the House of Lords in Smith v Desmond [1965] AC 960, a case dealing with a different but closely related topic. 
    29    It is also relevant, apart from the history, to look at the position of this offence in the Crimes Act 1900 in the context of the structure of that Act. Robbery and aggravated forms thereof are dealt with in ss 94 to 98, and it is within those sections that the offence charged in the present case is to be found. On the other hand, larceny, and the various aggravated forms of larceny, are dealt with extensively in ss 116 to 154B. This indicates, even apart from the history of the offence, that stealing from the person should be regarded as a variant of robbery, rather than as a variant of larceny. 
    30    Robbery is generally defined as “stealing from the person with violence or threat of violence.” Stealing from the person in s 94, it seems to me, can be defined as “robbery without violence or threat of violence”, but both offences involve the concept of stealing from the person and, when looked at in the context of the legislation, it seems to me that the phrase ""stealing from the person"" must have the same meaning in both contexts, that is, taking something that is on the person of the victim or in his presence and control. 
    31    GREG JAMES J: I agree with what has been said by both of their Honours. I have nothing for my part to add. 
    32    DUNFORD J: The order of the Court will therefore be appeal dismissed, conviction confirmed.

     60093/98 
     BARR J McINERNEY AJ Monday, 24 May 1999 
     
     REGINA v Mark William AUSTIN 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   BARR J: Mark William Austin seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 25 August 1997. On each of two counts of driving in a manner dangerous to the public occasioning grievous bodily harm, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for four years, comprising a minimum term of three years and an additional term of one year. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently and to commence on 13 February 1998. Upon each of two further counts for the same offence, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for twelve months commencing on 13 February 1998. The total effective sentence for the four offences was therefore one of four years imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of three years and an additional term of one year. 
     
      
    2   The attack made on the sentences is not on their total effective length but on the apportionment between the minimum and additional terms. It is submitted that his Honour should, within the confines of the four year total term, have allocated more time to the additional term and correspondingly less to the minimum term resulting in an earlier date upon which the applicant should become eligible to be released on parole. 
     
      
    3   The facts of the matter are as follows. On 25 December 1995 the applicant was the driver of a utility truck which was travelling south in Wallgrove Road, Eastern Creek. He carried a friend, Robert Fryer, as a passenger. A number of other cars were travelling south. The applicant's utility overtook one vehicle and then a second. The drivers of those vehicles estimated his speed at 120 kilometres per hour and 110 to 120 kilometres per hour respectively. He remained on the wrong side of the road before overtaking the first and the second of those vehicles and in doing so forced an oncoming vehicle off the road. Fortunately nobody was injured in that incident. 
     
      
    4   The utility then returned to the correct side of the road before pulling out over an unbroken separation line to overtake a third vehicle just before a left-hand bend. His speed was then estimated to be 150 kilometres per hour. 
     
      
    5   During that manoeuvre the applicant lost control of the utility, oversteered and caused it to fishtail and travel at an angle. It then veered sharply into the southbound lane again and continued off the road surface on to the gravel shoulder on the eastern side of the roadway. It continued along the shoulder until it veered sharply right across the roadway and into the northbound lane. It was by that stage quite out of control. It collided with a northbound car, somersaulted twice and came to rest on its wheels. 
     
      
    6   The speed limit in Wallgrove Road was ninety kilometres per hour. 
     
      
    7   Mr Fryer was very badly hurt. He was taken to Liverpool Hospital and placed under intensive care where he remained for four weeks. He initially had a glasco coma score of four and a CT scan showed a small hypodensity in the right inferior parietal region. His nasal bones were fractured and he had damage to the teeth. He ultimately lost all his teeth. 
     
      
    8   On his discharge from intensive care he was transferred to the brain injury unit. He demonstrated high level language impairment, tended to be verbose and demonstrated poor memory and poor new learning ability. He found it difficult to control his temper and his behaviour. 
     
      
    9   His physical condition improved but he continued to be unable to run because of unco-ordination. He had mild left sided weakness and a significant dysaesthesia and hypertomia on the left. 
     
      
    10   The last report available to his Honour showed that Mr Fryer had physical and cognitive attributes sufficient to perform manual and unskilled work but that his behavioural abnormalities and personality change precluded employment in the open market. He was thought unlikely to improve. 
     
      
    11   The driver of the northbound car was Mrs Debi Bryce. She too was very badly hurt. She was taken to intensive care at the Nepean Hospital. She had a closed head injury causing cranial nerve palsy, a fracture of the base of the skull, a compound fracture of the left knee requiring several operations during the course of which she contracted infection by Golden Staph, there were progressive significant degenerative changes. The left tibial plateau, the left humerus and wrist, the right wrist and olecranon were fractured. Two of the results were permanent deformity and scarring. 
     
      
    12   When the matter was before his Honour, Mrs Bryce was continuing to make progress but was found to have significant residual disabilities to the left arm and particularly the left leg. She would eventually need a total knee arthroplasty. Mrs Bryce had been an active sports woman but would never thereafter be more than a spectator. 
     
      
    13   The front seat passenger in Mrs Bryce's car was Julie Ann Bryce. She suffered fractures of the sternum, the left radius and the right radial head and suffered intensive seat belt bruising and abrasions. She spent four days in hospital. 
     
      
    14   A child, Amy Lee Bryce, was in the rear seat of Mrs Bryce's car. She received severe lacerations to the left groin requiring sutures and extensive bruising over the groin and a fractured pelvic bone. She spent six days in hospital. 
     
      
    15   The applicant was thirty-one years old at the time of the offences and thirty-three years old when sentenced. He had a criminal and traffic record which, as his Honour dispassionately observed, did not help him. His record is very bad. I will not detail the several offences of dishonesty. Between 1982 and 1997 he was dealt with in court or by traffic infringement notices sixteen times for offences arising out of the manner in which he drove a vehicle. Most were for speeding. On three occasions he exceeded the limit by more than thirty kilometres per hour, on one he exceeded it by more than forty-five kilometres per hour. There were three convictions for driving at a speed dangerous, in a manner dangerously and negligently. On several occasions he had been convicted of being an unlicensed driver or rider and otherwise behaving in an irresponsible way in connection with a motor vehicle. 
     
      
    16   The Probation and Parole Service furnished a pre-sentence report for his Honour's assistance. It summarised the applicant's extensive contact with that Service from July 1983, when he had been released to licence, until November 1990 when he had completed a Community Service Order. Over the seven-year-period he had been subject to supervisory recognisances and had been sentenced to two other Community Service Orders. 
     
      
    17   Although some reports prepared by the Service during the 1980s had been highly critical of the applicant's performance under supervision, he had appeared, as time went by, to make progress in some areas of his life so that towards the end of his involvement with the Service, comments about his performance had become more positive. A pre-sentence report prepared in June 1989 said that he appeared to be genuinely motivated to work and to wish to avoid future conflict with the law. It has to be said, unfortunately, that seven of the occasions upon which the applicant was dealt with because of the way he drove a vehicle, occurred after the date of that report. 
     
      
    18   Speaking about the offences and his driving generally, the applicant told the reporter that the accounts of the various witnesses did not reflect his perception of the collision. He admitted that he had had a number of traffic infringements but considered himself less fortunate than others in avoiding police detection on the roads. 
     
      
    19   The report commented favourably upon the applicant's work history and his attitude to work. The applicant was assessed as suitable for a community service order and for periodic detention. 
     
      
    20   His Honour drew attention to the maximum penalty applicable to each of the four counts, namely seven years imprisonment. His Honour considered that this case did not fall into the worst category of cases but it was, on its objective facts, a very very bad case. In my opinion this case did fall into the worst category of cases. 
     
      
    21   No criticism was made on appeal of his Honour's findings or remarks. It was put that the pre-sentence report, which I have summarised, implied that the applicant had benefited from prior supervision of that Service. Support was sought to be drawn from a remark by his Honour that the applicant had appeared to be settling down in recent times. As was noted in the pre-sentence report, the applicant's domestic circumstances have changed. He had separated from his former girlfriend and their daughter and had taken up life with a new partner. It was put that those changes provided strong grounds for an extended period of supervision and accordingly a longer additional term. 
     
      
    22   It does not appear evident to me that the applicant might need more than twelve months on parole to re-establish relations with his present partner and to achieve a proper relationship and arrangements with his former partner an child and to do the other things necessary to effect a proper entry once again into responsible community life. 
     
      
    23   It was put that the need was even greater bearing in mind what was described as a gap in the applicant's history of offences. As I have mentioned, there was no gap. The applicant's reversion to repeated speeding offences is a matter of considerable concern. 
     
      
    24   His Honour made no mention of any enquiry whether there existed circumstances which would justify an additional term which exceeded one-third of the minimum term for the purposes of s 5(2) of the Sentencing Act. There will be cases where the Court may infer from a sentencing judge's failure to mention such a matter that it has been overlooked. I would not draw such an inference in the present case. As I have said, none of the circumstances which have been put would seem to me to justify an additional term exceeding twelve months. 
     
      
    25   Secondly, I think that the objective seriousness of these offences call for the imposition of sentences which require the applicant to serve not less than three years full-time detention and I think that his Honour must have been of the same opinion. 
     
      
    26   I would refuse leave to appeal. 
     
      
    27   McINERNEY AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding judge and for the reasons he has advanced. 
     
      
    28   BARR J: The order of the Court therefore is as I have proposed.

     60081/98 
     BARR J McINERNEY AJ Monday, 24 May 1999 
     
     REGINA v Andrew Troy RUSHBY 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1   BARR J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Christie of Queen’s Counsel in the District Court. For the offence of having sexual intercourse without consent and in circumstances of aggravation, his Honour sentenced the applicant to penal servitude for eight years comprising a minimum term of five years and an additional term of three years. In imposing sentence, his Honour took into account under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act the offences of taking and driving a conveyance and driving whilst unlicensed. 
     
      
    2   The applicant, who was then aged eighteen years and ten months, and his co-offender Stephen Spence, then aged sixteen years and three months, met a thirteen year old girl at Liverpool. The three decided to steal a car. They did so and used it to spend some hours in the Liverpool area carrying out various activities. They then drove north along the Singleton Road but at a remote place many kilometres north of Colo, the vehicle broke down and they abandoned it in the early hours of the morning. They lit a fire and waited. When it was daylight they began to walk towards Windsor, intending to hitchhike. The applicant and the co-offender discussed raping the girl. She realised what was happening and began to walk faster trying to get away from them. They caught her up and the co-offender pushed her down at the side of the road and dragged her into rough bushland. The applicant assisted and the two dragged her between 100 and 150 metres to a secluded spot well away from the road.  
     
      
    3   The complainant was distressed, yelling and screaming. The co-offender ordered her to remove her clothes and threatened to strike her with a piece of wood if she did not do so. He had penile vaginal sexual intercourse with her and ejaculated. The applicant watched. The applicant then forced the complainant on to her hands and knees and had anal intercourse with her and ejaculated. When they had finished with her the two of them tore up her clothing and used it to tie her to a tree. They left her to her own devices and got a lift back to the Sydney metropolitan area. 
     
      
    4   The complainant managed to free herself and get help. Eventually she was taken to hospital and cared for. She suffered superficial injuries. 
     
      
    5   The applicant travelled to South Australia and was identified and extradited to New South Wales after being arrested on another charge. He immediately admitted his involvement in the offence and pleaded guilty before the Magistrate. 
     
      
    6   The co-offender was dealt with by his Honour Judge Graham on 12 March 1998. His Honour was furnished with a copy of Judge Christie’s remarks on the sentence of the applicant. Judge Graham sentenced the co-offender to penal servitude for six years, comprising a minimum term of three years and an additional term of three years, and in doing so took the same two offences into account. 
     
      
    7   The first ground of appeal asserts a disparity between the sentences of the applicant and the co-offender which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant. It was submitted that his Honour found that the co-offender was the instigator of the offences, that is that it was his idea that they take place. He also found that the part played by the applicant was not quite as aggressive as that of his co-offender. 
     
      
    8   Then it was submitted that the subjective features significantly favoured the applicant over the co-offender except for the fact that the co-offender was younger. 
     
      
    9   It was submitted that the co-offender’s criminal record was worse than the applicant’s. The co-offender had been convicted of seven offences of break, enter and steal, two of stealing, one of taking a car without consent, one of possessing house breaking implements, one of malicious damage and one of being an unlicensed driver. On the other hand, the applicant’s record consisted of five driving offences, one of resisting arrest, one of assaulting police, one of larceny, one of illegally using a motor vehicle and one of possessing implements to enter a motor vehicle. At the time of the offence the co-offender was serving the additional term of a control order imposed in the Children’s Court. 
     
      
    10   It was submitted that the applicant made full and candid admissions to the police whereas the co-offender made no admissions. The applicant was therefore entitled to a greater allowance for contrition.  
     
      
    11   It was submitted that the applicant pleaded guilty at the Local Court at the earliest opportunity whereas the co-offender pleaded guilty at a much later stage. 
     
      
    12   Most significantly, it was submitted, the applicant offered to give assistance to the police by giving evidence against the co-offender. The offer was significant and timely and there was a reasonable chance that it must have persuaded the co-offender to plead guilty, thereby sparing the complainant from having to give evidence at his trial. The information given to the police was truthful, accurate, reliable and complete. As a result of the undertaking, the applicant will have to spend his custody in protection. He told the sentencing judge he feared for his life because of threats made against him by the co-offender. 
     
      
    13   It was submitted that the sentencing judge had regarded the difference between the ages of the offenders as “marginal” and, notwithstanding that he was under eighteen years of age at the time of sentence, the co-offender had to be treated as an adult under the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act because the offence was a serious indictable offence. Accordingly, it was submitted that there was no available argument that the principle of parity did not apply. 
     
      
    14   It was submitted that despite all these matters the applicant had received a minimum term that was forty per cent greater and a total term that was twenty-five per cent greater than those received by his co-offender. In all the circumstances he had a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    15   As both sentencing judges realised, this offence was a very serious one indeed and their Honours delivered substantial and detailed remarks on sentence. Both made detailed findings of fact about the respective offenders. 
     
      
    16   As sometimes happens when co-offenders are sentenced by different judges, however, not all the findings of fact are consistent. This is no criticism of their Honours, who were obliged to find facts according to the evidence before them. It is appropriate to say, however, that it was most unfortunate that both matters were not dealt with by the same sentencing judge. 
     
      
    17   As will appear, some of the facts found by Judge Graham concerning the co-offender relating to relative criminality of the offenders and to their subjective features did not accord with the findings of Judge Christie about the applicant. That is a source of some difficulty for the applicant in this application. As he found the facts relating to the co-offender, Judge Graham made detailed reference to the remarks on sentence by Judge Christie. Although Judge Christie found in the applicant’s case that the co-offender was the “chief perpetrator” of the events in the sense that it was his idea that they happen and that the applicant did not play quite so aggressive a part as the co-offender, the corresponding findings were not made by Judge Graham. In fact, his Honour was not satisfied that the co-offender was the perpetrator and regarded their respective parts in the events as about equal. 
     
      
    18   There were four statutory aggravating features of the offence, namely that actual bodily harm was occasioned to the complainant, that threats were made, that the offence was committed in company and that the complainant was under the age of sixteen years. Although it was the co-offender who threatened to strike the complainant if she did not do their will, they were equally responsible for it. Each of the offenders was therefore responsible for the features the statute regards as aggravating the offence. 
     
      
    19   In addition there were two other features not mentioned by the statute which might properly be regarded as aggravating the part played by one or both the offenders. One was that the offenders tied up the complainant and left her in a remote place and the other was that one of the acts of sexual intercourse was anal intercourse. Both were responsible for the former feature but only the applicant for the latter. Judge Graham thought it an important distinguishing feature. It has to be said that it was a particularly revolting act carried out as part of an atrocious attack. 
     
      
    20   An available view of the objective facts therefore was that but for the act of anal intercourse, the part played by the two was about equal. Such a conclusion would not favour the applicant’s case. 
     
      
    21   Turning to the subjective features, it is correct to say, as counsel for the applicant has submitted, that the applicant had a more favourable record than the co-offender. It has to be said, however, as pointed out by Judge Graham, that neither of these offenders had been involved in any similar offence before and that was a significant matter in the sentencing of two young offenders. 
     
      
    22   The applicant correctly submits that the fact that the co-offender was serving the additional term of a control order was one of the facts making for a longer term for the co-offender. So was the fact that the applicant made full and candid admissions to the police compared with the co-offender who made none and pleaded guilty at a late stage, perhaps, though not certainly, after he heard that the applicant was prepared to give evidence against him. 
     
      
    23   The point is also well made that the applicant was entitled to a substantial discount, not available to the co-offender, for the assistance promised to the authorities in giving evidence against the co-offender. It has to be said, however, that the assistance was not of the kind likely to produce maximum discounts of the kind mentioned in R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243. In one sense the assistance was no more than an expression of a full working out of the applicant’s plea of guilty and his contrition. This was not a matter in which the applicant was able to assist the authorities in other criminal matters. 
     
      
    24   It seems to me that the outstanding difference between the two offenders, however, was their relative ages. The co-offender was only sixteen years three months of age at the time of the offence, two years seven months younger than the applicant. That age difference could not, in my opinion, accurately be described as marginal. It is large and significant. It was so regarded by Judge Graham and correctly so in my opinion. 
     
      
    25   The applicant relied on a statement of this Court in R v Bus, an unreported decision of 3 November 1995. In the judgment of the Chief Judge at Common Law, Hunt J, appears this passage: 
     
      
       
        
        In any event, it is obvious that the relevance of the principles stated in s 6 (of the Criminal Appeal Act) to each individual case depends to a very large extent upon the age of the particular offender and the nature of the particular offence committed. An offender almost eighteen years of age cannot be expected to be treated according to law substantially different to an offender just over eighteen years of age. In both cases, the youth of the offender remains very relevant. Rehabilitation plays a more important role and general deterrence a lesser role. But that principle is subject to the qualification that, where a youth conducts himself in the way an adult might conduct himself and commits a crime of considerable gravity, the function of the courts to protect the community requires deterrence and retribution to remain significant elements in sentencing. 
        
       
      
    26   As Judge Graham pointed out, this was a very serious offence, properly calling for a substantial sentence in order to deter others from offending in like manner. However, making due allowance for the statement of the Chief Judge at Common Law in Bus when offenders as young as the co-offender are being sentenced, although aspects of general deterrence and retribution are still significant, particularly when offences are as serious as this one, the Courts must give more weight to the question of rehabilitation than they do in the case of an older offender. There was here a very substantial disparity in chronological ages of the offenders and a corresponding disparity in their maturity. 
     
      
    27   Summarising the differences between the offenders, the most important matters favouring the applicant were his early plea of guilty, his contrition and his assistance to authorities and the fact that the co-offender was on parole. All things being equal, those facts would have produced a lower sentence for the applicant. 
     
      
    28   They have to be balanced against two features which seem to me to be overwhelming. They were that it was the applicant who was responsible for the anal intercourse and the significantly different basis upon which the co-offender was entitled to be sentenced, bearing in mind his tender age. 
     
      
    29   In my opinion in all the circumstances it cannot be said that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance about the differences between the sentences. 
     
      
    30   The second ground of appeal asserts that the sentence was manifestly excessive by comparison with sentencing statistics. His Honour first determined that a head sentence of the order of twelve to fourteen years would have been appropriate. It is submitted that a starting point of fourteen years would be manifestly excessive. However that may be, this Court does not know that his Honour began so high. His Honour might have begun at the lower end of that range which would not be manifestly excessive for an offence as serious as this one in my opinion. 
     
      
    31   His Honour was of the opinion that the offence did not fall into the worst category of offences of this kind although it was not far removed. I think it was almost in the worst category of cases. The fact there were four statutory aggravating features present when one would have justified conviction under s 61J of the Crimes Act and the presence of the two other aggravating features I have mentioned, made the offence a very serious one indeed. 
     
      
    32   It was said that the statistics showed this offence to be in the top thirty per cent of all offenders for this offence and that in view of the applicant’s age, his plea of guilty, his remorse, his admissions and the assistance he gave, such a position in the scale is not justified. 
     
      
    33   The figures do demonstrate that the sentence is high but not, in my opinion, that it is outside the proper range of sentencing discretion of his Honour. Reference might be made to R v Lewis, unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal of 14 December 1993. That was an appeal following a plea of guilty for a single offence under the same section. The applicant there committed violent and revolting acts on the victim, probably no more revolting than the ones in the present case. Absent from the case were the tender age of the complainant and the feature that the complainant was left to fend for herself in a remote part of the bush. A total sentence of eight years was there held to be within the range of sound sentencing discretion of the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    34   A single case does not draw the limits of a tariff, of course, but the case does demonstrate that the statistics to which our attention has been drawn do not themselves state the limits of sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    35   Although because of the seriousness of this matter I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    36   McINERNEY AJ: This matter, I must say, has caused me considerable concern. It again arises from the practice that seems to be common in the District Court of two separate judges sentencing persons involved in a common offence. This circumstance has been commented on unfavourably by this Court on many occasions but the practice seems to persist. 
     
      
    37   In the circumstances here it is not open to this Court to determine which findings of fact of either judge should be accepted in the circumstances here. 
     
      
    38   In the end, therefore, I agree with the orders proposed by the presiding judge having regard to the factual findings by his Honour Judge Graham and the two circumstances referred to by the presiding Judge. 
     
      
    39   BARR J: The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as I have proposed.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCRIMINAL DIVISIONSPERLING JWednesday 5 May 199970069/98 - Regina v Constantine GeorgiouJUDGMENT No 1HIS HONOUR:1 Constantine Georgiou and Bruce Malcolm Harrison are charged with the murder of Rick de Stoop, Sasha Milenkovic and Michael Kulakowski on 9 November 1997, and with the attempted murder or Robin April David on the same occasion. Mr Georgiou has applied for a separate trial.2 The three deceased and Mr David were all members of the Bandido Outlaw Motor Cycle Club, Mr Kulakowski being the Club’s National President and Mr Milenkovic being the Club’s Sergeant at Arms. Mr Georgiou was a current member of the Rebels Outlaw Motor Cycle Club. Mr Harrison was an associate of Mr Georgiou and a former member of that Club.3 The Crown case against the co-accused is as follows. Mr Georgiou and Mr Harrison acted in concert from beginning to end. They travelled to the Black Market Café in Mr Georgiou’s Porsche motor vehicle. The deceased were killed by gun shot wounds and Mr David was wounded by gun shot. The shooting took place in a basement area of the Café which is not open to the public. A Mr Culshaw, an off-duty doorman employed at the Café and a current member of the Rebels Outlaw Motor Cycle Club, obtained the keys to the basement from the bar attendant. The deceased, Mr Milenkovic, left the group of people he was with for a short time and, on returning, said to the deceased, Mr Kulakowski, that Mr Culshaw and Mr Georgiou wanted to have a meeting with them. The three deceased then left the people they were with and went towards the door to the basement. About five minutes later gunshots were heard from the basement. Mr Georgiou was seen running from the basement door, followed by Mr Harrison who was waving a gun. The two men ran from the Café and were seen running along the street. Mr Harrison was observed to have his right hand down the front of his trousers inside a long black overcoat as if concealing something. They ran to Mr Georgiou’s Porsche. Mr Georgiou entered the driver’s side and Mr Harrison the passenger’s side, and the vehicle was driven off. Police pursued the vehicle at high speed and then at a safer distance. In Crown Street, a metal object was seen to be thrown from the passenger window of the vehicle. It was recovered by the police and found to be a Smith & Wesson pistol. A Baretta pistol was also located nearby. Soon after, the Porsche was located in Hutchinson Lane, Surry Hills. Mr Harrison was seen walking away from the vehicle. He was apprehended, broke free, and was recaptured and handcuffed. Mr Georgiou was not present. A Mr Spanakakis (who is charged with being an accessory after the fact) and others obtained a ticket for Mr Georgiou to travel by sea to Japan on the vessel “Arafura”. On 3 February 1998 Mr Georgiou was apprehended on the vessel, carrying a stolen passport, a driver’s licence in a false name and a large amount of cash. He was arrested.4 The forensic evidence against Mr Harrison includes the following. Mr Harrison was found to have been shot in the left wrist. A pair of gloves found on the front seat of the Porsche were stained with blood which could not be excluded from having originated from him. DNA recovered from a .25 spent bullet, found on the floor of the basement near the deceased, Mr De Stoop, was very likely to be from Mr Harrison. DNA recovered from Mr Harrison’s footwear was very likely that of the deceased Mr De Stoop.5 Forensic evidence against Mr Georgiou includes the following. The Smith & Wesson pistol was purchased in 1990 and later given to Mr Georgiou. Photographs were found on Mr Georgiou’s premises depicting him and others holding pistols identical with the Smith & Wesson and Baretta pistols recovered in Crown Street. Premises depicted in those photographs were searched and a number of bullets and cartridges fired from the Smith & Wesson and Baretta pistols were recovered. Four cartridge cases recovered from the murder scene were fired from the Smith & Wesson pistol. Two damaged bullets recovered from the murder scene were fired from the same pistol. A bullet fragment was discharged from that pistol. A damaged copper bullet jacket and a damaged lead bullet core, discharged from the Smith & Wesson pistol, were recovered from the body of the deceased, Mr Kulakowski. 6 On 10 November 1997, the accused, Mr Harrison, participated in an electronically recorded interview with the police, attended by his barrister. Relevantly, Mr Harrison said that he was driven to the Café by Mr Georgiou in the Porsche, which was parked in a street near the Café at a point specified in a diagram drawn by Mr Harrison and annexed to the record of the interview. Mr Harrison went on to give the following account of events. When he arrived at the Cafe, Mr Harrison had been drinking and was drunk. Mr Harrison went to the toilets and then to the cloakroom area. He started taking off his jacket when his hand was hit violently. Mr Georgiou had been out of sight for only two minutes. Mr Harrison went out of the Club. He noticed that his hand was injured and saw blood coming from it. Mr Georgiou grabbed him by the elbow. Mr Georgiou walked him to the Porsche. Mr Harrison assumed that Mr Georgiou was going to take him to hospital. They got in the car, Mr Georgiou driving. Mr Georgiou was driving fast. He said they had to get Mr Harrison to hospital. Mr Harrison denied throwing anything out of the vehicle and said he did not recall Mr Georgiou doing so. He said he could not recall breaking free when he was apprehended by the police.7 At a joint trial, Mr Harrison will require the Crown to tender the electronic record of the police interview and the sketch plan showing where the Porsche was allegedly parked.8 Mr Georgiou has served a notice of alibi. The witness statements provided support his case that he was not at the Café at the relevant time. 9 The principles of criminal procedure relating to applications for a separate trial are clearly established by the authorities. Where the facts constituting the alleged offences have much in common, the interests of justice are best served by a joint trial. That is particularly so where the Crown case is that the accused were engaged in a common enterprise. On the other hand, there should be a separate trial if a joint trial would not be a fair trial. In Middis (27 March 1991, unreported), Hunt J specified the way in which these considerations are to be weighed, in a passage approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Baartman (6 October 1994, unreported) and Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66. He said: “Briefly, the relevant principles are that: 
     
      
       
        (1) Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and 
        
        (2) where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and 
        
        (3) where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material, a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.” 
       
      
    10 I am not persuaded that, in the present case, the evidence against the applicant is significantly weaker than that against his co-accused. Much of the evidence against Mr Georgiou and Mr Harrison will be the same, it being the Crown case that they acted in concert throughout. Some of the evidence, as I have indicated, will be different but it substantially the same case which the Crown will seek to prove against each of them. 11 The tender of the electronic record of Mr Harrison’s police interview would be prejudicial to Mr Georgiou. It has the potential to cast a shadow over Mr Georgiou’s denial that he was present at the Café and over his alibi evidence. That, however, is as far as the prejudice might go. This is not a case in which the co-accused implicates the applicant in the commission of the crime in an attempt to exculpate himself. Mr Harrison did not purport to know, in his interview, what Mr Georgiou was doing while he was out of Mr Harrison’s sight. Furthermore, the potential prejudice is capable of being specified in a straightforward way. A clear and unequivocal instruction to the jury could be formulated not to use the Harrison interview as evidence that Mr Georgiou was present at the Café or as evidence of anything done by him.12 I do not assume that juries invariably implement instructions of that kind. Such an assumption would preclude the grant of a separate trial in every case where evidence to be adduced against or in favour of a co-accused would be potentially prejudicial to the applicant. The confidence which one would have in such an instruction being followed will vary from case to case. Where, as in the present case, the potential prejudice is readily identifiable and can be made the subject of an appropriate instruction in a straightforward way, there is reason to expect that a jury would understand and follow the instruction. In such a case, there is no serious risk that the case against the applicant will be immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material.13 Having regard to these considerations, I am not satisfied that the applicant, Mr Georgiou, would suffer a positive injustice in a joint trial. The application should accordingly be refused.14 The order I make is that the application for a separate trial is dismissed.

     JUDGMENT - ON SENTENCE 
      
      
     
     
     HIS HONOUR:  
      
     Introduction 
    1 On 23 November 1998 Jay William Short, [“the prisoner”], was presented for trial in this Court and upon an indictment containing three counts.2 The first count charged that the prisoner, on 2 March 1997 at Lithgow, had murdered one Alison Marie Lewis. Such a crime contravenes section 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), [“the Act”], and attracts a statutory maximum penalty of penal servitude for the term of the offender’s natural life.3 The second count charged that the prisoner, on 2 March 1997 at Lithgow, had robbed one Melanie Spillane of certain of her property, namely a handbag containing money and other personal items, and that he had used, at that time, corporal violence on that victim. Such a crime contravenes section 95 of the Act and attracts a statutory maximum penalty of penal servitude for 20 years. Where the particular corporal violence results in an actual wounding of the victim, or in the actual inflicting upon the victim of grievous bodily harm, section 96 of the Act increases the statutory maximum penalty to one of penal servitude for 25 years. 4 In the case of Mrs. Spillane, the corporal violence allegedly used against her caused both wounding and grievous bodily harm; and the normal endorsement on the cover sheet of the indictment refers in fact to section 96 of the Act. The count actually charged is framed, however, in terms appropriate to section 95 of the Act; and I proceed for present purposes upon the footing that section 95, rather than section 96, is the correct point of statutory reference.5 The third count charged that the prisoner, on 2 March 1997 at Lithgow, had assaulted one Kerry Tonkin; had then beaten and otherwise ill-treated her; and had thereby occasioned to her actual bodily harm. Such a crime contravenes section 59 of the Act; and attracts a statutory maximum penalty of penal servitude for 5 years.6 To each of the three charges thus preferred against him the prisoner pleaded not guilty; and he was put, accordingly, upon trial by jury. That trial occupied the Court until 14 December 1998, on which day the jury returned verdicts finding the prisoner guilty as charged of all three of the offences nominated in the indictment.7 Proceedings on sentence were stood over to a date to be fixed; and were listed, eventually, for hearing on 19 March 1999. On that day evidence and submissions on sentence were received; and the Court took time to consider what action it would take.8 While sentence was thus reserved, the Crown applied to re-open the proceedings on sentence. This application came before the Court on 9 April 1999, and was granted for certain stated, and limited, purposes. 9 The re-opened proceedings on sentence came before the Court on 23 April 1999; and certain supplementary evidence and submissions on sentence were received. Once again, the Court took time to consider what it would do in the matter of sentence. 
     
     The Relevant Facts 
    10 Shortly after midnight on Saturday 1 March 1997, Miss Lewis, Miss Tonkin and another friend went together to a night club in Lithgow. There they met Mrs. Spillane. The group of young women enjoyed themselves at the night club until about 2.50 a.m. on the Sunday morning. There had been talk among the people in the group of walking to a nearby municipal pool and of there taking a swim. Miss Lewis left the night club at about 2.50 a.m. About 10 minutes later Miss Tonkin and Mrs. Spillane and another girlfriend left the night club. They went to the Lithgow Hotel; and then, having dropped off their friend at the hotel, Miss Tonkin and Mrs. Spillane began to walk back towards the night club, on their way to the swimming pool. Their route took them to the vicinity of an open area of public recreation space known as the Watsford Oval. The area was very dark; and the locality seems to have been practically deserted and fairly lonely. The two young women were carrying their shoes; and Mrs. Spillane was carrying her handbag around her neck.11 Suddenly, both young women were attacked from behind. Miss Tonkin felt something “across the back of my shoulders, like somebody had hit me or thrown something at me”. She heard, simultaneously, Mrs. Spillane cry out: “Who are you?”. Miss Tonkin thereupon ran off as quickly as she could. In effect, she circled the Watsford Oval, crying out for help; and she was found, eventually, by a taxi-driver whom Mrs. Spillane had managed to reach after having escaped from her assailant. 12 Mrs. Spillane’s own experience with her assailant was more prolonged. She described it as follows in her evidence: “Q. Just tell the Court what happened? 
     
      A. Someone hit me on the shoulder with something. I don’t know what it was at the time, and Kerrie ran.  
      
      Q. What happened to you? 
      
      A. He grabbed me by the hair, and pulled me towards the oval. 
      
      Q. Were you hit anywhere else? 
      
      A. On the head. 
      
      Q. Were you hit on the head, or the shoulder first? 
      
      A. The shoulder. 
      
      Q. After that you were hit on the head? 
      
      A. Once he had hold of me he started hitting into my head. 
      
      Q. He had hold of your head? 
      
      A. Yeah, my hair. 
      
      Q. How were you held? 
      
      A. I was hunched over, and he had hold of the back of my hair, and was just pulling me by the hair.  
      
      Q. In which direction? 
      
      A. Towards the oval. 
      
      Q. Pulling your head down? 
      
      A. Yes. 
      
      Q. Were you doing anything? Were you saying anything? 
      
      A. Screaming. I don’t really remember. 
      
      Q. You were screaming? 
      
      A. Yeah. 
      
      Q. As loud as you could? 
      
      A. Yep. 
      
      Q. Was anything said? 
      
      A. No, he just told me to ‘shut up’ many times. 
      
      Q. Sorry. 
      
      A. Many times. 
      
      Q. And pulling at you? 
      
      A. Yep. 
      
      Q. Did you have a glimpse of anyone?

     (Trial transcript 29 (43) - 31 (51) 
    13 The handbag that Mrs. Spillane had been carrying was pulled off her and over her head during the course of her struggle with her assailant. The bag contained at that time a small amount of money, probably no more than $10 or thereabouts; and some other personal items.14 Neither Miss Tonkin nor Mrs. Spillane could give any very precise description of their assailant.15 Miss Tonkin suffered, as a result of the assault upon her, a sore back. Mrs. Spillane suffered a nasty laceration to the back of her head. The laceration required some three stitches.16 Miss Lewis’ movements after she left the night club cannot be re-constructed in any detail. It seems clear that Miss Lewis left the night club shortly after the departure from the club of a young local man named Michael Doalman. They were acquainted, and they had spent time, but it would seem no great time, in each other’s company at the night club. According to Mr. Doalman’s evidence, Miss Lewis attempted to persuade him to go with her for a swim at the municipal pool, but he preferred to go home. She followed him as he walked away from the club; and both of them walked, hand in hand, towards a nearby hockey field. They made their way to the vicinity of a shed standing near the hockey field; lay down together on the grass; and had sexual intercourse. Thereafter, they went their separate and opposite ways: he towards his home; she towards the pool.17 When the attack upon Mrs. Spillane and Miss Tonkin became known, a search was made for Miss Lewis. As the search progressed through the Sunday morning, various blood-stained items of Miss Lewis’ clothing were discovered. Eventually, and a little after 2.30 p.m., her naked body was discovered. It was buried in a sand pit forming part of some recreational facilities. Other discarded items of Miss Lewis’ clothing were found nearby in bins. 18 Post-mortem examination established that Miss Lewis had died from ligature strangulation. Her body carried multiple traumatic injuries, including an injury which had been inflicted by “an object with a linear edge”, (trial transcript: Dr. Lawrence: 83(54) ), and with such force as to cause a perforation of the right ear-drum. There were, also, post-mortem drag marks on the body. 19 The Crown case against the prisoner on the charge of murder was based, putting the matter very simply and broadly, upon the basis of the combined effect of inculpatory admissions made to the investigating police and to other people; of inferences to be drawn from the finding of a pubic hair of the prisoner on Miss Lewis’ skirt; and of the finding in two separate locations of two pieces of a stick, one piece of which was able to be related to the injuries caused to Mrs. Spillane and Miss Tonkin; and the other piece of which was able to be related to the perforating injury to, and to the region of, Miss Lewis’ right ear.20 The accused’s case at trial can be summarised in the form of the following adaptation of my summing up notes: 
     
     1. He did not commit the murder; was not present when the murder was committed; and took no active part whatsoever in connection with the carrying out of the murder.  
      
     2. He was present at the beginning of what proved to be the chain of events culminating in the murder. But his only active involvement in that initial stage of events was to put his hand over Miss Lewis’ mouth in order to stop her from screaming out.  
      
     3. Thereafter he followed as she was led off by two men: one, a local man and a friend of the prisoner, named Aaron Martin; and the other a man known only as ‘the tattooed man’. He continued to follow until the group reached the place where the tattooed man began to slap Miss Lewis’ face. Disapproving of what was going on, and craving some form of drug-shot, he remonstrated briefly and ineffectually with the tattooed man, and then left that scene. 
      
      4. Thereafter he never saw Miss Lewis alive. When he returned to the relevant spot he found her dead, and in the condition described in his evidence. 
      
      5. Seeing that she was dead, he panicked and buried the body in the manner described by him in his evidence. Thereafter he disposed of Miss Lewis’ clothing, and the burial implements, also as described by him in his evidence. 
      
      6. When arrested by the police and interviewed, he made incriminating statements for the reasons that he feared that the police would bash him; that he was afraid of inculpating Aaron Martin and the unidentified tattooed man, with consequent risk to his own physical safety; and that he was attempting to buy time until he could see his solicitor.  
      
      7. He denies having made some of the apparently incriminating statements attributed to him by various of the witnesses.  
      
      8. He was, but in an exculpatory rather than an incriminating sense, the wrong person in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
    21 The man Aaron Martin to whom reference is made in the foregoing summary was called in the Crown case. His evidence was directed not so much at inculpating the prisoner, as in exculpating himself. It is, I think, clearly to be inferred from the verdict of the jury that the jury accepted to the required legal standard the substance of the evidence of Aaron Martin, and did not accept the substance of the contrary evidence of the prisoner. The Objective Gravity of the Offences of which the Prisoner has been found Guilty22 There is, I think, no need to dwell at length upon this topic. 23 Miss Lewis was a young woman aged some 19 years. She was done to death in the most cruel and wicked fashion. Her murder was, in purely objective terms, an appalling crime calling for uncompromising denunciation, and meriting severe punishment. 24 The offences committed against Miss Tonkin and Mrs. Spillane tend, in the nature of things, to be overshadowed by the brutal killing of Miss Lewis. Those other offences were, however, by no means trivial examples of their respective categories of crime. Had Miss Tonkin not been lucky enough to get away quickly from her assailant; had Mrs. Spillane not shown great tenacity and presence of mind in resisting her assailant; and had Mrs. Morrison, the taxi driver, not come upon the scene when she did; and had she not thereupon shown prompt and practical good sense in her own responses; the consequences for those two young women might have been much worse. The Relevant Subjective Features of the Prisoner’s Case25 Some of these features can be established simply and readily.26  First, the prisoner was born on 12 August 1975. He was aged, therefore, 21 years and some 7 months at the date of the offences of which he has been found guilty; and he is now aged 23 years and some 9 months. He is single. He has an ex-nuptial child aged about 16 months. 27 Secondly, the prisoner has criminal antecedents. Some of them have violent aspects, but nothing remotely approaching the lethal violence done to Miss Lewis; or equating in any real way to the particular type of personal violence done to Mrs. Spillane and to Miss Tonkin. 28 Thirdly, the prisoner has a seriously dysfunctional family and personal history. It is not necessary, I think, to go over that history in minute detail. Exhibits B, C, 1 and 2 on sentence present that detail in a completely clear and a readily accessible fashion. It suffices to say that the picture thus painted is a bleak and saddening one. The focus of that picture is sharpened, in my own view, by the evidence given in the sentence proceedings by the prisoner’s father. The content of that evidence, but more significantly the way in which it was given, seem to me to be eloquent of the reality of what is conveyed by the bare words of the documentary exhibits.29 Fourthly, there is in Exhibit 3 on sentence material in the nature of school reports, other personal certificates of achievement, and various personal references. This material suggests that the prisoner is not without worthwhile personal capacities, provided only that he is properly motivated to realise them. 30 It is not really possible to go with any confidence beyond the foregoing matters; and that for reasons appearing in two reports dated respectively 23 October 1998 and 22 January 1999, and prepared by Dr. Bruce Westmore, a well-recognised Forensic Psychologist.31 In the report of 23 October 1998 Dr. Westmore speaks in the following terms of the prisoner’s then mental state as he, Dr. Westmore, perceived it in the light of the examination which he conducted in connection with that report: “Mr. Short presented as a man who looked his stated years, he was pleasant and cooperative. He maintained good eye contact and he spoke spontaneously and expansively. There was some intensity to his affect but he was not unduly anxious I felt. He was not clinically depressed and there was no evidence of any psychotic features such as delusions or hallucinations. He presented as being of average intelligence, he certainly was an alert and attentive historian.”32 Later in this report, Dr. Westmore made the following observations concerning his diagnosis of the then psychiatric condition of the prisoner: “On psychiatric examination at this time there is no evidence that he is suffering from any form of mental illness and nothing in the history he provides of the event itself which would suggest mental illness played any role in the alleged offending behaviour. There is also no information to suggest he would have the defence of substantial impairment available to him on the history he currently provides.”33 In his later report dated 22 January 1999, Dr. Westmore describes as follows part of the exchanges that he had, in connection with the preparation of that report, with the prisoner: “I asked him what his thoughts were now about this matter and he said he hopes to get a re-trial. I asked him was he intending to appeal and he said yes. I asked him the basis of this but he could not say.  
     
      I asked Mr. Short was he maintaining his innocence in relation to the offending behaviour and he responded in the affirmative.” 
    34 Later in that same report, and with respect to his prognosis concerning the prisoner, Dr. Westmore says: “This man’s prognosis remains most uncertain, this because of the nature of the offences and his current position regarding the offences. By maintaining his innocence of the charges it is not possible to assess any feelings of regret and remorse he may have for his actions nor indeed to make any comments about his level of psychological insight and understanding into the processes which led up to the offending behaviour. To that extent his prognosis should be considered in a guarded fashion at this time.  
     
      It is likely he has a personality disorder with anti-social traits and he suffers substance abuse. He has little to no insight into this latter problem.” 
    35 Because of the barriers to which Dr. Westmore refers in his later report, it is very difficult to judge whether, as the Crown has submitted, the prisoner should be sentenced upon the basis that it can be found properly that the available evidence shows him to be psycopathic; and so, likely to repeat the extreme violence of the crimes of which he has been found guilty.36 Dr. Westmore was called to give evidence at the sentence proceedings. Part of that evidence was the following: “Q. He maintains, never mind for the moment whether correctly or not, that there was no offence? 
     
      A. That’s correct. 
      
      Q. Does that not then leave us in a situation where diagnosis, analysis and prognosis that might have been rational upon the basis of other premises simply becomes speculative because there is no given basis from which one can confidently argue it? Does that miss something or is that correct? 
      
      A. That is essentially correct. The problem is that we cannot understand this offence because he gives no history about it, so it is hard to understand this offence, even in the context of his personality, as we know it, with what we already know about it. We cannot understand how or why he committed this offence because he gives no history about it and that does make things like predicting future dangerousness very difficult.  
      
      Q. Well, impossible in truth? 
      
      A. Virtually it does, yes.” 
    37 And later: “Q. A person who gives way to base feelings, ……………., or feelings of cruelty to other human beings could, or is likely to, give way again in the future? 
     
      A. They may do. You need, probably, to answer the question fully, to understand the circumstances of how the first incident occurred. As I said earlier, the major problem we have here is that he is not acknowledging it. He is giving no account of his mental state at the time or what he did or why he did it, so it is very difficult to tell you, in Court, about things like his future risk of doing behaviour like this again. 
      
      HIS HONOUR: Q. In truth, it is impossible? 
      
      A. Yes, it is. 
      
      Q. All that one can say about it is that he has, upon the basis of a reliable and reliably conservative diagnosis, a personality disorder of some kind? 
      
      A. Yes.  
      
      Q. And, really, while he persists in denying that he had any involvement in any one of the three of these offences, and denied all three of them, that is just an impenetrable barrier to going, logically, any further forward? 
      
      A. Pretty much.” 
    38 I am not prepared to make such a finding as the Crown has submitted should be made. I think that the preponderance of the evidence, and in particular Dr. Westmore’s oral evidence, which I accept, is, on a fair view, to the contrary. 
     
     Should an Indeterminate Sentence be Imposed? 
    39 Section 19A of the Act is in the following terms: “(1) A person who commits the crime of murder is liable to penal servitude for life. 
     
      (2) A person sentenced to penal servitude for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person’s natural life. 
      
      (3) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 442 (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than penal servitude for life). 
      
      (4) This section applies to murder committed before or after the commencement of this section.” 
    40 In 1996, section 431B was added to the Act. So far as is at present material, it is there provided: “(1) A Court is to impose a sentence of penal servitude for life on a person who is convicted of murder, if the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.”41 The Attorney-General, in explaining this provision to Parliament, said: “The preservation of that discretion does no more than recognise the possibility that a murder, which, on its face, demonstrates an extreme degree of criminality, may nevertheless call for something less than life imprisonment. For this reason the discretion to impose less than life remains, although it is a discretion which cannot be lightly exercised in the face of the principle expressed in the Bill.”42 On 11 June 1998 I passed sentence in the matter of Regina v Gary Zane Glasby. On that occasion I expressed the following views: “It is obvious that the imprisonment of an offender for the term of his natural life is, to say the very least, a draconian punishment. The existence of such a penalty has excited strong, and sometimes passionate, responses from individual Judges. An especially powerful statement in that regard is that of Allen J in his Honour’s dissenting judgment in R v Baker (unreported, CCA 20 September 1995). His Honour says: 
     
      “In  
     Regina v Petroff  
     (unreported, 12 November 1991) Hunt CJ at CL said: 
      
       
        ‘In the Old Testament, in the second Book of Moses called Exodus, the author laid down the law concerning acts of violence in these terms: 
        
        “And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe” (Ch 21 vv 23-25) 
        
         
          It is, as I say, an understandable desire on the part of the victim or those whom he or she leaves behind to have the law of Moses applied. But we now live in a civilised community. Winston Churchill, during a debate in the (UK) House of Commons in 1910 said this: 
         
        
        “The mood and tempo of the public with regard to the treatment of crime and criminals is one of the most unfailing tests of the civilisation of any country.” 
        
         
          Those words admirably express the basi approach which a judge in a civilised country must take. 
         
        
        Section 19A of the  
       Crimes Act 
        1900 empowers this Court to sentence a person convicted of murder to penal servitude for life. That is what such sentence, if imposed, means. It means for life. It means that never can there be any hope of release. It means never, no matter how many decades go by, will the prison door be opened and the prisoner be allowed out again. It matters not whether he be sixty, seventy or survives to eighty. He is there for life. Such a sentence cannot lightly be imposed in any civilised society. 
        
        There are, of course, circumstances in which in a civilised society such a sentence may be called for. Such cases will be quite exceptional. But clearly they exist. The law so provides. It would be foolish in the extreme to attempt to give a list of the types of cases which would warrant the court taking this, the most extreme measure available to the law. Three, however, stand out in respect of murder. The first is the case of the professional killer, the person who cold-bloodedly assassinates others for gain. That is one category. Another is the case where the killer is so fundamentally psychotic that it could never be safe to release him back into the community. I may say that the evidence that that is so would, as far as I am concerned, need to be quite strong. The third is the case of an offender who embarks on such a course of criminality that nothing short of the knowledge that the most extreme punishment the law can give awaits him would deter him from continuing that course” [emphasis added].” 
       
      
    43 In Glasby  itself, I accepted the above statements of principle; and I took the view that they warranted the imposition in that particular case of an indeterminate life sentence. I took that view because, on the given facts of that case, the murder there in question had been a cold-blooded contract killing; and fell, therefore, within a category of murder such as was regarded, even upon a conservative judicial approach, as appropriate to attract the indeterminate sentence.44 Had I been persuaded in the present matter that there was credible evidence capable, if accepted, of establishing, to quote again the words of Allen J, that the prisoner “……is so fundamentally psychotic that it could never be safe to release him back into the community”, I would not have hesitated to impose the indeterminate life sentence. But, as I have earlier explained, I do not think that the evidence to hand can possibly support so grave a finding against the present prisoner. In saying so, I am not unmindful of the grief and anguish of the family of Miss Lewis. Their burden is a terrible one; and nothing that this Court can say or do can possibly wipe away that level of pain or make good that level of loss.45 Those considerations are powerful and they command rightly a proper respect and acknowledgment; but they are no substitute for concrete evidence sufficient to justify the draconian view that nothing short of an indeterminate life sentence will do justice in the case of the present prisoner. As I have earlier tried to explain, I do not think that the evidence is sufficient for that purpose.46 I regard it as self-evident that the present case calls for the imposition of a significant sentence of penal servitude; but I have not been persuaded that nothing short of an indeterminate life sentence will give proper weight to what is described in section 431B of the Act as “ ……… the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence ……….”. I can but reaffirm my conviction, expressed in other judgments on other occasions, that the proper maintenance of the rule of law requires, particularly in cases of the present kind, a need to keep carefully in mind that vindication is not the same thing as vindictiveness. 
     
     Conclusions as to Sentence 
    47 I have considered the various comparative materials that were placed before me by both counsel. Such materials are, as always, of broad, indicative value only. Those materials suggest to me, however, that such is the gravity of the crime committed against Miss Lewis, that a fair balance of the relevant objective and subjective factors in the prisoner’s particular case is justly measured by an aggregate sentence of penal servitude for 20 years. I consider that it should be divided between a minimum term of 16 years and an additional term of 4 years. I have considered the question of “special circumstances” of the kind contemplated by section 5 of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW). I think that it is possible to nominate various subjective features of the prisoner’s case that would be apt to fall within that description; but I am not persuaded that they point to any need for a period longer than 4 years as being necessary to provide for the proper rehabilitation of the prisoner back into the general community should the Serious Offenders Review Council consider that he is fit for such conditional release at the expiration of his minimum term. 48 Such an approach and, as well, the principle of totality, make it expedient, in my opinion, to deal with the offences committed against Mrs. Spillane and Miss Tonkin by the imposition, in each such case, of a fixed term of penal servitude. In the case of the offence committed against Mrs. Spillane, being the more serious of the two offences, I consider that the proper fixed term is one of 5 years. In the case of the offence committed against Miss Tonkin, I consider that the appropriate fixed term is one of 2 years.49 All sentences will date from 3 March 1997, the day upon which the prisoner first entered his present custody. 50 Jay William Short, in respect of the crime of murder of which you have been found guilty by the jury you are convicted. You are sentenced to penal servitude for 20 years. That sentence is apportioned between a minimum term of 16 years and an additional term of 4 years. The minimum term will commence on 3 March 1997 and will expire on 2 March 2013. The additional term will commence on 3 March 2013.51 In respect of the charge of robbery with corporal violence, you are convicted and sentenced to penal servitude for a fixed term of 5 years to commence on 3 March 1997 and to expire on 2 March 2002.52 In respect of the crime of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, you are convicted and sentenced to penal servitude for a fixed term of 2 years to commence on 3 March 1997 and expiring on 2 March 1999.

      REGINA v. NICOLAS BREHOI 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 BARR, J: I will ask Greg James, J. to give the first judgment.2 GREG JAMES, J: The applicant, who appears in this court on his own behalf, seeks an extension of time to appeal against his conviction on 4 August 1995 in the District Court of New South Wales on one count of supply a commercial quantity of heroin, and four counts of supply heroin. These counts, to which the applicant entered pleas of guilty, were contained in three indictments upon which the applicant was arraigned before her Honour Judge Karpin on 6 June 1995. The applicant was represented in respect of those pleas and in the subsequent sentencing proceedings by his solicitor. Her Honour expressly ascertained of the applicant whether he understood the course he was then taking. The applicant gave evidence on the plea, as he had on an earlier voir dire.3 On 29 May 1995 the applicant and a co-accused had been indicted on the first of those three indictments. That indictment contained two counts of supply heroin, one involving a commercial quantity. The applicant had pleaded not guilty to those two counts and prior to the trial commencing a voir dire examination had occurred on his objection to the admissibility of an ERISP conducted with him, in which it was said there were material admissions. The applicant was represented by Mr. S. Cook of counsel during the voir dire hearing.4 On 5 June 1995, after a lengthy hearing, her Honour ruled that the contents of the ERISP were admissible. The applicant contents her Honour erred in her determination of fact on the voir dire. It may be accepted it was in consequence of that ruling that the applicant entered the pleas of guilty to which I have earlier referred.5 The applicant was sentenced in respect of all the offences by her Honour to an effective total sentence of six and a half years imprisonment with a minimum term of four years and an additional term of two and a half years to commence on 2 December 1993. Thus, the minimum term has now long expired and the additional term has substantially expired.6 The applicant lodged an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the severity of his sentence. He says here that he wanted his lawyers to lodge a notice of appeal against conviction and sentence but the notice of appeal challenged sentence only. On the hearing of that application Mr. Vasta, solicitor, appeared to assist the applicant, and the applicant himself addressed submissions to the court, both oral and written.7 On 16 December 1966 the Court of Criminal Appeal refused leave for the applicant's sentence appeal. In the judgment at paragraph three the court adverted to the grounds of appeal in respect of sentence as filed, which contended her Honour failed to take into account:-  ""What is described as 'the fact' that the prisoner was assaulted by police. She did indeed refer to those allegations which were in part the subject of a voir dire hearing and she said that she disbelieved him.""8 Notwithstanding that Mr. Vasta addressed on the matter suggesting that her Honour had made an adverse finding on the voir dire relying, inter alia, on a report by the Ombudsman, the court concluded the trial judge had reached an independent conclusion on the evidence. Reference was made there, as it was here, to a witness who might have been called on the issue of the alleged assault, but the court concluded that the allegation had been thoroughly canvassed on the voir dire hearing and ""her Honour, not surprisingly, indicated she was not prepared to reopen that hearing"" when an attempt was made on the sentencing proceedings to re-agitate that question. The court concluded:- ""In the course of Mr. Vasta's remarks, and even more markedly in the course of what the prisoner said to us, it seemed to be inferred that his real complaint is that he was not guilty of these offences, that he was in fact collaborating with the police, that there was no intention to commit crimes, but the fact of the matter is that after that voir dire hearing in which he was represented by counsel, he formally pleaded guilty to all five counts and he was represented on the sentencing proceedings by his solicitor, the same solicitor who out of courtesy to the court and out of some sense of obligation to the prisoner as his former client, has attended here today. 
     
      I think there is no substance in the claim that her Honour failed to take any of those matters into account..."" 
    9 Thus, it appears that the Court of Criminal Appeal on the sentence application was concerned with the very matters which the applicant seeks to agitate now before us, and it is in that context that the applicant seeks an extension of time to appeal or seeks leave to appeal against his conviction for the reasons that he gives in his notice of application, in which he contends that ""the appeal was lodged in the 10 day period, it has been re-submitted now as civil proceedings relevant to this matter were only concluded in March 1998"". 10 Section 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act  provides:- ""(1) Any person convicted on indictment desiring to appeal to the court, or to obtain the leave of the court to appeal from any conviction, or sentence, shall give notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal, in such manner as may be prescribed, within 28 days of the date of such conviction or sentence.  
     
      (2) ... 
      
      (3) the court may, at any time, extend the time within which notice of appeal, or notice of an application for leave to appeal, is required to be given to the court."" 
    11 Notwithstanding the 10 day period referred to in the applicant's notice for extension, the period had been, since the amendment of 1991, the period now prevailing of 28 days.12 In support of the extension sought, the applicant contended in his notice of appeal that he had previously appealed the conviction and severity, but ""as only two judges were hearing the appeal, the judges decided and accordingly informed me that because there were only two judges they therefore could not hear the conviction side of the appeal"". ""This is no fault of mine."" I note at this point that neither the original notice of appeal, which is before us, nor the judgment on that appeal assists these contentions. 13 Thus, it appears that almost four years after the event, having received legal advice at the time and legal assistance subsequently, neither of which it is now sought to impugn, having brought an appeal in which the questions propounded were at least to some extent agitated, having pleaded guilty and thereby solemnly admitted all the legal ingredients of the originally charged offences, the applicant seeks an extension of time to challenge an interlocutory decision on admissibility for asserted error of fact or in exercising a discretion.14 It is not suggested that a wrong decision of law by her Honour overbore the applicant's will such as to vitiate the admissibility of his plea so that the admissions thereby made should fairly be allowed to be withdrawn. Nor is it suggested that the plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt or that there was an issuable question of guilt; that is, a real question to be tried. (See the discussion of the relevant test by Badgery-Parker, J., with whom Wood and Mathews, JJ. agreed, in Regina v. Davies (CCA, unreported 16 December 1993.)15 The onus to establish the integrity of the plea (rather than any possible defect of admissibility for matters of evidence that might be tendered in the Crown case) lies on the applicant. Such a burden will ordinarily, of course, be harder to discharge the longer any suggested matter impugning the integrity of the plea and known to the applicant is allowed to lie.16 In this case, what appears to have activated the present application, according to the grounds and submissions, is a finding in the applicant's favour by the Victims Compensation Tribunal. In my view, on an analysis of what her Honour said in her judgment on the voir dire and what appears in the papers provided by the applicant in the Victims Compensation Tribunal, there are no questions in common between the two such as to give rise to any question of inadmissibility, either at common law, in discretion, or under s.410 of the Crimes Act. 17 The Victims Compensation Tribunal held that the applicant was suffering from injuries but made no finding to suggest that those injuries were inflicted by police. Her Honour accepted that the applicant was suffering from injuries. She found no relevant illegality nor factual basis for the illegality asserted, nor such effect of the applicant's injuries as was continuing to operate at the time of the admission. 18 In the event that there was a sufficiently arguable case, in my view the court would consider granting an extension. The principles by which such a sufficiently arguable case should be examined have been set out in this court in Regina v. Unger (1977) 2 NSWLR 990. The finality of decisions is a principle to which Unger (supra) refers, and indeed that principle has also been adverted to in the cases involving discretion to permit withdrawal of a plea. See Regina v. Liberti (1991) 55 A. Crim R. 120. 19 There are in this case, in my view, insuperable impediments to this application. I am not of the view that any basis has been shown which might have enabled the overturning of the plea. I am not of the view that any error has been shown or even indicated in her Honour's determination on the voir dire. I am not of the view any adequate explanation has been offered for the delay and in that regard I am unable to accept that the applicant believed that the conviction appeal had been on foot, in the absence of any explanation from him as to his failure to prosecute any such conviction appeal in the interim, particularly in the light of what was said on the sentence appeal by the court then deciding that matter.20 In my view, the extension of time should be refused.21 BARR, J: I agree.22 SMART, AJ: I also agree.23 BARR, J: The order of the court is that the application for an extension of time within which the appellant may appeal against his conviction is refused.********

     REGINA v LJUBE VELEVSKI 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   GROVE J: After a trial extending almost two months, the appellant was convicted on four counts of murder. The victims were his wife Snezana, his daughter Zaklina aged six and his twin daughters Daniela and Dijana aged three and a half months. The appeal challenges conviction only, senior counsel for the appellant having indicated that it was not intended to pursue application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
    2   The appellant and the victims lived in a newly built residence at 10 Castle Court Berkeley, a suburb of Wollongong. As at June 1994 when the deaths occurred they had resided there for about 18 months. The other usual occupants of the house were Petre and Tasa Velevski, the appellant’s parents. It will not hinder clarity and avoid much repetition if various members of the family are referred to on occasions simply by their first names. A central, and the most prominent, issue at trial was whether the Crown had excluded any possibility that Snezana had killed the children and then committed suicide. No one contended, as obviously it could not be, that the three children were other than victims of murder. Throughout the trial the Crown case that the appellant was the perpetrator of the four killings was frequently referred to as murder/murder and the hypothesis that Snezana had killed the children and then herself as murder/suicide. It was useful terminology which I will adopt. At about 4pm on Monday 20 June 1994 Police Constables English and Gray responded to a message to call at the residence 10 Castle Court Berkeley. They found in the house the appellant, a niece of his (Dianna Nadjovski) and persons whom they described as two elderly females and two elderly males. One of the latter was the appellant’s father Petre. The appellant told police that he had not seen his wife and children since the previous night; that his wife had taken the children (into the bedroom) and locked the door. The ""privacy” locking device operated when a button on the inside was pressed. The door could be opened from the outside by the insertion of a flat projector into a rectangular slot on the outer door handle. A screwdriver, a “paddlepop” stick or similar would perform the function. The appellant denied knowledge of how to unlock the privacy device externally.  
    3   Constable English was able to peer through a gap at the bottom of the door and she saw bare legs of a human being apparently lying upon the floor. Attempts to force open the door without an implement were unsuccessful and Constable Gray and Petre went in search of a screwdriver. The appellant also left the doorway and returned with a hammer which he gave to Constable English. She used this to break through the door and she put her hand inside and released the lock by turning the inside handle.  
    4   The evidence included both video and still photographs of the scene which confronted the entrants. Within the room in a gap between a large double bed and a baby’s cot were the bodies of the four victims. They were stacked in a formation commencing with the bodies of the twin babies (each of whom was clothed in a sleeved and collared sleeping bag) face downwards directly on the floor; Zaklina’s body was over the twins with her upper portion resting across them and Snezana was prone above the bodies of her three children. Later, a knife was located near Zaklina’s face on top of the bodies of her sisters. One of Zaklina’s legs was raised in a stiffened fashion. In each case death had been caused by the individuals’ throat being cut. The knife found was capable of inflicting the various wounds and being the relevant weapon. 
    5   Upon questioning by police the appellant denied any complicity in the killings. The death scene and other surrounding circumstances provoked particular interest and some controversy among forensic pathologists and it will be necessary to elaborate evidence which they subsequently gave and this can conveniently be done when dealing with ground 6 which asserted that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
    6   In final form the grounds of appeal relied upon the appellant were as follows: 
     
      
       
       “1. His Honour erred in leaving the case to the jury. 
       
      
      
       
       2. His Honour erred in his direction in relation to circumstantial evidence. 
       
      
      
       
       3. His Honour erred in relation to his directions on lies. 
       
      
      
       
       4. His Honour erred in his directions in relation to onus of proof. 
       
      
      
       
       5. His Honour erred in not giving appropriate directions in relation to the use that the jury could make of the evidence of Petre Velevski.  
       
      
      
       
       6. The verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory.” 
       
      
    7   Ground 1 can be dealt with in the context of ground 6 and will not require separate reference.  
    8   Mr Buddin SC with Mr Haesler for the appellant (neither of whom appeared for the appellant at trial) submitted that grounds 2 and 4 “drew their colour” from each other and were considerably interdependent.  
    9   The first complaint in respect of those grounds referred to his Honour’s instructions to the jury concerning the drawing of inferences. His Honour had given this general direction:  
     
      
       
       “As ordinary citizens you are not expected or required to leave your commonsense behind, but you are expected to apply such ordinary commonsense to the evidence that you have heard and to your assessment of the witnesses and, just as you do in your ordinary everyday lives, it is open and proper for you to draw inferences from the direct evidence which you find established. 
        
        
       In other words, having heard the evidence, you may take the view that if certain facts are proved, well then, it follows naturally and logically from the facts that have been proved that other events occurred or that other facts are established. That does not mean, of course, that you can guess or speculate. There are some inferences that follow logically from the facts that have been proved directly whilst there are other ideas that would be pure guesswork or speculation. 
        
        
       As I say, you must not guess or speculate but it is proper for you to draw inferences which logically follow from the facts that you find proved in any other way.” 
       
      
    10   It was not suggested that this direction, couched as it was in terms customarily used was erroneous but it was complained that there was a requirement to link the direction specifically to the instant case. The submission however did not include an articulation of exactly what it was asserted that his Honour should have said. The jury had been told without objection that it seemed to his Honour that the only issue in the case (of which the jury was then and there told it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt) was whether it was the appellant who did the killings.  
    11   Other passages in the summing up which it is unnecessary to recite emphasized the necessity for a finding of guilt to be made beyond reasonable doubt and that such a finding necessarily excluded the possibility of innocence. Nothing said by his Honour to the jury appears to me to be inconsistent with authority, for example Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) 1983 153 CLR 521 and the cases cited particularly by Gibbs CJ and Mason J @ p 535-7, nor is there inconsistency with anything later said in cases such as Edwards v The Queen 1993 178 CLR 193. The argument contended that there was a lack of adequate assistance to the jury but such a submission cannot succeed in abstract and there was no description of the precise assistance said to be missing. I do not perceive any gap in his Honour’s directions to the jury. 
    12   A further complaint was the asserted failure to identify “some intermediate facts” which were indispensable to proof of the Crown case. The language of the submission had its genesis in statements such as those of Dawson J in Shepherd v The Queen 1990 170 CLR @ p 579 where he said that  
     
      
       
       “It may sometimes be necessary or desirable to identify those intermediate facts which constitute indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt.” 
       
      
      
     The intermediate facts were stated in this case to be that the Crown had to prove that the killing of Snezana was murder; that it was not suicide and, it had to establish the opportunity of the appellant (to perform the killings). These so described intermediate facts are no more than ingredients (even if one is expressed in negative language) of the central fact requiring proof namely that the appellant was the perpetrator. 
      
    13   The complaint in the ground concerning onus of proof was based upon this passage in the summing up: 
     
      
       
       “But before you can convict on circumstantial evidence you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the facts as found by you are inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is guilty. But that does not mean that you should consider each circumstance by itself and consider whether that circumstance is consistent with innocence, and then move on to the next circumstance. It is the combination and the totality of the circumstances that you find proved that you must look at and you must consider whether that combination and totality of circumstances is consistent with innocence. If it is, it is your duty to acquit. But if, having regard to the nature, the totality and the combination of circumstances, you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the circumstances are consistent only with guilt, then it is your duty to convict. 
       
      
      
       
       In the context of this case that means that you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killer could not have been Snezana Velevska, the murder suicide theory; that it could not have been Petre or Tasa Velevska, the only other persons in the house that evening, and could not have been someone from outside the house. 
       
      
      
       
       It has not been suggested it could have been some one from outside the house. Tasa is, we are told is infirm and partially crippled, and Petre has denied doing it. The defence case has been fought on the basis that it was, or could have been, Snezana who did it.” 
       
      
    14   It was argued that the expression “consistent with innocence” appearing twice in the above passage was, on first appearance suggestive and on second appearance effective, of reversing the onus of proof. I am unpersuaded that such a conclusion is fairly open. In context, his Honour was elaborating the meaning and application of his instructions concerning the appellant’s entitlement to be acquitted unless the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the facts were inconsistent with any other rational conclusion other than that the accused was guilty. 
    15   I would reject grounds 2 and 4. 
    16   In similar terminology to grounds 2 and 4, ground 3 simply made a general assertion of error. Specific matters were raised in submissions. Near the commencement of his charge to the jury, the learned trial judge gave conventional directions as to the use that might be made of the lies and they followed the broad lines of the contemplations offered in Reg v Lucas (Ruth) 1981 QB 720 in particular when referring to the motive for lying the expression “consciousness of guilt” was used. As recognized in Edwards v The Queen that expression may in some contexts be synonymous with admission of guilt. Further objection was taken to his Honour’s remarks about independent proof of falsehood. He had said: 
     
      
       
       “The fourth matter is that you must be satisfied that it was a lie, either because it is proved to be such by independent evidence which you accept, or because the accused has said something inconsistent with it - that is, he gives two inconsistent versions of one offence (sic - event?) in which case at least one of the versions must be false, or if the accused has admitted what he said was false.” 
       
      
    17   However he concluded this portion of his charge immediately following the extract above cited with this caution: 
     
      
       
       “But, bear this in mind, the accused is not charged with telling lies but with murder; and you must not convict him of murder simply because you find he told lies. Lies are only relevant in accordance with the principles I have just given you if they amount to circumstances which, along with other circumstances, satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that there is no other rational conclusion but that the accused is guilty.” 
       
      
    18   The terms of that direction would exclude any conception that the earlier use of the expression “consciousness of guilt” was intended to convey the sense “admission of guilt”. That meaning would not require the addition of other circumstances such as the jury were then told were necessary. Nor am I persuaded that the jury may have been led into error by what his Honour said about independent proof. At this stage of the summing up the guidance being given was significantly abstract and what was said on this issue needs to be understood and seen in the context of the whole summing up. Towards his conclusion his Honour gave the jury a summary focussed upon the crown reliance upon asserted lies in the particular case. It is apparent that the Crown Prosecutor had relied upon three instances, the first and third being statements about problems in the appellant’s marriage and his ignorance of how to manipulate the privacy locks in the house. The jury were explicitly directed that they would not take those matters into account at all and, by way of emphasis, his Honour remarked that the evidence in relation to the third instance showed that the appellant’s claim of ignorance concerning the locks may well have been the truth. 
    19   As to the remaining matter the jury were directed: 
     
      
       
       “The next matter that the Crown says was a lie that he told, was that he spent from 1pm to 6am in Zaklina’s room and that he slept from about 3 or 4pm until 6am the next morning. The Crown says that this is proved to be a lie firstly as a matter of common sense, sleeping for that long. There is Dr King’s evidence and the Crown says that there is Mr Petre Velevski’s statement in his first statement about him being out on the Sunday evening, if you are satisfied that that is established. 
       
      
      
       
       The Crown submits the reason for this lie, and you will remember I said you have to be satisfied that (a), that it was a lie and (b), that it related to a material matter and the Crown says that the reason for this lie is to give him a type of alibi that he was asleep and therefore he did not do it. On the other hand, in relation to that, it is submitted on behalf of the accused that the fact that he and his parents heard nothing proves that it must have been a murder caused by Snezana, and therefore there was nothing to hear, so it does not matter whether he was asleep or not. That is an issue of fact and you have to resolve that for yourselves.” 
       
      
    20   (Dr King was a neurologist who had specialist knowledge of sleep patterns and whose practice concerned persons suffering sleep disorders. He examined the appellant’s stated sleep patterns as conveyed to police in the course of various interviews. He testified that it was extremely unlikely that the appellant, if going to sleep between 1pm and 4 pm would sleep through until 6 am the following morning. The reference to “being out” on the Sunday evening is to the statement by Petre to police that the appellant had been out of Zaklina’s room on the Sunday evening. In testimony Petre repudiated this part of his statement to police.) 
    21   The use that the jury might make of this evidence was restricted (consistently with the earlier general direction) in these final observations relating to the Crown case on this topic: 
     
      
       
       “You will remember I told you the four matters that you must take into account in relation to lies and if you are satisfied there (was) a lie, the Crown does not suggest that that is an admission of guilt. The Crown puts it merely, if established, as one of the additional circumstances and the Crown submits that all those circumstances taken together, the combination and totality of the circumstances, will satisfy you that there is no other rational conclusion open than that the accused is guilty, notwithstanding any doubts which may otherwise have existed as a result of the medical and pathological evidence.” 
       
      
    22   It was submitted that the alleged inadequacy of directions on the issue of lies (and the significance in the minds of the jury) was manifest in a question received from them in the course of deliberation. 
    23   The question read: 
     
      
       
       “You directed on Wednesday that one of the three lies presented by the Crown was not proven as a matter of law. Does this preclude the jury from considering other evidence as lies and testing them appropriately against the three criteria; for example the issue of arguments in the house during the days before the killings.” 
       
      
    24   It was submitted that this should be viewed as revealing that two suggested lies of the three sought to be relied upon the Crown rather than only one were being considered by the jury. His Honour had said of the assertion concerning the state of the marriage that it “had not been proved to be a lie” and continued “I direct you as a matter of law you would not be able to take that into account as telling a lie” whereas in respect of the assertion of ignorance of the operation of the privacy locks, he had said that the appellant’s claim may well have been the truth. Those observations almost inevitably suggest that the jury note referred to the direction about the assertion of lie concerning the state of the marriage where his Honour did couch his directions in terms of lack of proof as a matter of law and it does not imply that the jury were erroneously taking into account the excluded matter which his Honour had described as probable truth. It is true that in the early general directions his Honour had spoken of four rather than three criteria, however the thrust of the enquiry was whether the jury could range outside the matter relied upon by the Crown and his Honour responded by directing the jury that this was not permissible. He mentioned that there were four criteria and I am unpersuaded that any of the events recounted demonstrates that the jury may have impermissibly approached the issue of asserted lies told by the appellant.  
    25   Ground 3 is not sustained. 
    26   Ground 5 complained of the absence of directions about the use that might be made of the evidence of Petre Velevski. He had been interviewed by police and it was said that at that time he was “a suspect” although one would not rationally read into that any more than that it would be expected that all those in proximity and with possible opportunity of perpetration would be classified as suspects until eliminated. In this case the evidence revealed three people other than the victims in and about the home at 10 Castle Court and they were the appellant and his parents. There was no evidence suggesting forced intrusion into the house by a stranger. The appellant’s mother had suffered a stroke a few years previously and was handicapped and in poor health. It was not suggested at trial nor at the hearing of the appeal that she could reasonably be regarded as a possible perpetrator. 
    27   Petre Velevski sought to recant portions of the statements to police in particular reference to the appellant having emerged from Zaklina’s room on Sunday evening (contrary to his assertion that he had slept from Sunday afternoon through to Monday morning) and the Crown Prosecutor was permitted to cross examine. Reliance was placed upon an observation in Lee v The Queen 1998 72 ALJR 1484 @ 1488: 
     
      
       
       “Even if the trial judge was right to conclude, as he did, that (Mr Calin) could be cross-examined about his prior inconsistent statements and was right to conclude that evidence could be given of those prior statements, it was necessary to identify how those prior statements might properly be used by the jury.” 
       
      
    28   No application was made by senior counsel appearing at trial for any specific direction in respect of Petre Velevski’s evidence although it should be acknowledged that complaint was made that his Honour’s directions were (un) “balanced in favour of the Crown”. Such a perception is not reasonably available to be drawn. 
    29   It is now rhetorically argued the Crown had to eliminate the possibility that Petre said what he did in order to protect himself (from potential culpability) rather than the appellant. In response to the Crown Prosecutor, Petre testified that he had no involvement in the death of Snezana or the children. Immediately following his testimony and in the absence of the jury there is recorded discussion in which senior counsel stated that the accused’s “defence” was that this was a homicide/suicide but that he was entitled to put that the Crown had not discharged its onus of excluding Petre as a possible perpetrator although he (senior counsel) did not intend to assert this. The Crown Prosecutor did not dispute this entitlement to argue that proposition to the jury. It is significant however that the appellant’s own testimony given later did not include any contemplation that his father could possibly have been the murderer. The accused’s testimony included these responses : 
     
      
       
       “Q. I suggest to you that you forced her off the bed onto the ground beside the bed near the cot, and there you cut her throat? 
        
       A. No, I was not even up. I did not do that, nor did I do this. It has been proved this has been committed by her. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. I suggest to you that after killing your wife you then set about killing the children? 
       
      
      
       
       A. No, she killed the children, then she killed herself. Had she not killed the children, then she would not have killed herself.” 
       
      
    30   The Crown has submitted that, not only was the defence case advanced to the jury to accord with that evidence, but the absence of any request for direction about the evidence concerning the appellant’s father was understandable in the light of the reliance by the defence on parts of it, prominently that he had heard no noise during the night between the Sunday and the Monday. 
    31   It might be added that reluctance to address to a jury a possibility that Petre may have been the perpetrator would be understandable in the light of the unchallenged evidence concerning his considerable devotion to his granddaughter Zaklina. Subject to exception, such as the first day of term, it appears that it was he that escorted the little girl upon her daily journeys to and from school. The inevitability that the children were victims of murder was accepted and a tribunal of fact might readily reject a hypothesis that the grandfather might have killed the object of such obvious affection and devotion. 
    32   It was acknowledged that leave was required to argue this ground. Leave should be granted if substance can be shown but in my opinion it was not. The Court did not restrict argument but in the absence of any merit being demonstrated, as was the case, I would refuse leave to rely upon ground 5. 
    33   The principal thrust of argument was directed to ground 6 within which in practicality ground 1 may be taken to be subsumed. The grounds of appeal were filed prior to the decision of the High Court in Fleming v The Queen 1998 73 ALJR 1. In that case the Court said: 
     
      
       
       “Use of the potentially confusing phrase ‘unsafe and unsatisfactory’ to cover the several different elements in the subsection is liable to mislead. There is no substitute for giving attention to the precise terms in which section 6(1) is expressed.” 
       
      
    34   The Court had earlier said: 
     
      
       
       “Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that, on an appeal under s 5(1) against conviction, the court shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that any one or more of three conditions is made out. The first is that ‘the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.’ The second is that ‘the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law.’ The third is that ‘on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice.’ This power to allow the appeal is subject to the proviso that, notwithstanding that the court is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, the court may dismiss the appeal ‘if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.” 
       
      
    35   The further use of the phrase “unsafe and unsatisfactory” to describe a ground of appeal is precluded: see Regina v Maxwell CCA unreported 23 December 1998. The focus of the argument advanced in respect of ground 6 was upon the first of the three conditions in section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act in essence that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable on the basis that the evidence showed that the Crown had not excluded possibilities which were consistent with innocence as well of course, as the third condition that there was miscarriage to be deduced from the cumulation of matters argued. Recognizing what has now been said authoritatively the submissions advanced should be dealt with in the terms by which they were advanced and the ultimate question remains for this Court namely whether the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. 
    36   In submissions counsel advanced three groups of numbered “points” which were elaborated both in oral and written form. The groups consisted of eight matters upon the hypothesis that Snezana suicided; seven matters concerning the expert medical evidence and twenty summarized reasons why the verdicts were submitted to be unsafe and unsatisfactory. I will address these groups and their constituents seriatim. 
    37   The first point was the existence of expert evidence supporting a murder/suicide conclusion. The possibility of suicide by Snezana was canvassed by the six forensic pathologists who testified - Dr Bradhurst, Dr Cooke, Dr Oettle, Dr Collins, Professor Mason and Dr Zillman. Dr Bradhurst had been called to the scene by police. He performed post mortems on the following day and a second post mortem examination later in the company of Dr Cooke. Dr Bradhurst considered that the probabilities favoured murder/suicide and Dr Zillman expressed the same view. The others favoured murder/murder except Dr Cooke who effectively adopted a non preferential stance. It will be necessary to conduct some examination of the views of the pathologists and the bases for them. At present it suffices to observe that there was credible evidence available to the jury upon which they could find that all four deceased were the victims of murder. It is recorded that Detective Whyte testified that he had been informed by Dr Bradhurst that others of his professional colleagues were in support of his view. Professor Hilton, Dr Duflou and Dr Botterill were named but no statement of their concordant views was obtained by police and they were not called. 
    38   The second point was the ordered way in which the bodies had been assembled which was described as consistent with the conduct of a meticulous housekeeper as Snezana had shown herself to be. This evidence was that she was tidy to the point of obsession. It is understood that none of these points was contended to be offered for assessment in isolation, however it can be observed that the jury had other evidence in particular the video of the scene (exhibit A), the viewing of which offered to the jury an unmistakable implication that someone other than Snezana had also been meticulous about housekeeping. Save the unmade beds in Zaklina’s and the parent’s rooms and the death scene in the main bedroom, there was not a single sign viewable on the video of any of the common incidents of human occupation of a house. At least Petre, Tasa and Zaklina had eaten a simple meal of potatoes on the Sunday night. Whilst it could not be considered unusual to wash up and clean after a meal, the video shows that nowhere in the house is there to be seen a cup, a glass, a utensil or anything anywhere detracting from what was called “pristine” presentation. The exception may be Zaklina’s schoolbag but it can be commented that it would not be surprising if the jury found the video portrayed scenes of striking unreality. The implication that there had been meticulous detailing of the house would be strengthened by the knowledge that Petre and Tasa had, in effect, been bundled out of the house shortly after 6 am on the Sunday with the belongings which they took with them wrapped in a sheet and others said to be left behind for later collection. The video does show some items which undoubtedly were equipments of investigators and would properly be ignored. 
    39   The next point referred to the absence of signs of struggle and the confinement of blood to the area where the bodies were located. The weight to be accorded to these observations is dependent upon the hypothesis being considered. There would have been little struggle by the twin babies. Zaklina’s body manifested a wound which some pathologists thought could be “defensive” but there were no signs of extensive struggle having been engaged in by her. If Snezana was also the victim of murder and she was killed first there would be no specially cogent reason to expect to find signs of struggle. It was well open to conclusion that the circumstances did not necessarily suggest suicide rather than murder. 
    40   Fourth, it was put that there was evidence that Snezana had resolved to leave her husband and take the children with her “wherever she went’”. The evidence emanated from the appellant and was corroborated by Petre’s testimony at trial. This was a matter of credibility and the jury had the advantage of hearing the testimony for the purpose of gauging what weight to attribute to it. 
    41   The fifth matter is an assertion of history of mental illness and depression in Snezana’s family said to effect her mother, her brother and herself. The evidence about these matters is ephemeral and some of it contradicts the submission. There is a hospital record that someone was told that Snezana’s mother had been taking the drug Sinequan. When, for how long and for what symptoms it was prescribed remain undisclosed. Snezana’s brother apparently was recorded as attending Illawarra Health Service at about the time he was making a job application and he gave a history of feeling depressed. Whether this history should be taken in the vernacular or diagnostically is undetermined.  
    42   Finally in this regard, the suggestion concerning Snezana was based upon a note by a social worker who pressed for a psychiatric consultation apparently as a reaction to perceived inability to establish rapport between herself and Snezana. It is to be observed that an attending medical practitioner (concerning the pregnancy resulting in the birth of Zaklina) had a different impression. A Crown contention that there is in fact no relevant psychiatric history would appear to be correct.  
    43   The sixth point raises the possibility that Snezana, as at 20 June 1994 was suffering from postnatal depression. The material in this regard is entirely speculative. The evidence shows that in general postnatal depression may not emerge until three to four months after delivery and that the symptoms may be hidden from the consulting physician. The obstetrician attending Snezana Dr Walker, saw her on 29 April and thought that she was exactly the opposite of depressed. He described her as jovial and chirpy, essentially “skiting” about how well things had gone and she was managing. Dr Rao, who was a general practitioner and the family doctor, had known Snezana since she was eleven years of age and he saw her and the children with the appellant in his surgery on 6 May. He said she appeared extremely happy on that day.  
    44   The seventh matter contended was that Snezana was upset following a phone call on that weekend with her mother. It was said that she relayed to the appellant that her mother had declined to mind the children and thus a proposed shopping excursion would have to be postponed. This was expounded in parallel with the proposition that Snezana was finding it difficult to cope with having her elderly parents in law living with her. Petre Velevski said that he had never heard Snezana complaining to that effect. In the absence of extreme psychiatric disturbance it would be difficult to assess these matters as contributors to a decision to commit murder/suicide.  
    45   The eighth and final matter referred to the evidence of Dr Wilcox a psychiatrist who had examined available material including reports, hospital files and some transcripts of evidence. She had also viewed the video (exhibit A). She testified that murder/suicide could be considered an act of love and that some people saw this as taking their (murder) victims to a better place. In the remarks attributed to Snezana by the appellant and his father, the concept of such an ascent to a better place did not appear, rather they were limited to saying that the children would accompany her “wherever she went”. The appellant said that she proposed that she might take a flat which, in addition to any other objection he had, he considered economically damaging. On analysis the evidence of Dr Wilcox was essentially theoretical. 
    46   In summary the eight points offered provided little which was probative of suicide let alone compelling towards such a conclusion. It cannot be overlooked that it was incumbent upon the Crown to exclude the possibility of suicide and not for the appellant to demonstrate it, but the matters raised individually and in combination fall far short of demonstrating that a reasonable jury ought not to have rejected that possibility. 
    47   The next group of propositions related to seven matters concerning the medical evidence, specifically the opinions of the forensic pathologists pro and con the circumstances manifesting murder/murder or murder/suicide. I shall turn to the expert evidence in a little more detail later but brief reference will need to be made in relation to some of this group. 
    48   First it was noted that all experts were confronted with a highly unusual scene, the stacking of the bodies lay outside the realm of the personal encounter of all experts and the novelty was not removed by reference to any published experience of others. It was contended that therefore the opinions were contaminated by both speculation and guesswork. Assumptions are frequently made by experts and it was for the jury to find which facts were established and then integrate those facts with relevant acceptable opinion.  
    49   Second it was put that those experts “disposed towards the Crown theory” were unable to provide a plausible scenario as to how the appellant is said to have committed the offences. It is trite to say that it was incumbent upon the Crown to prove that the appellant was the perpetrator of the killings and not that it had to prove all of the detail of the actions constituting homicide. In short, the Crown was required to prove that the appellant cut the throats of the victims thereby causing their death. Obviously it would be fortifying to identify more elaborately the mechanics of the killings but to say that a plausible scenario is absent does not inevitably raise a doubt about the identity of the perpetrator. The submission on behalf of the appellant did carry a hint of hyperbole. The Crown Prosecutor had explicitly put to the appellant that he had taken Snezana unawares and killed her, with other events following in succession, and it is clear that the jury did not find those circumstances, nor were they, implausible. 
    50   Third, the advantages of Dr Bradhurst who was the only pathologist who saw the bodies in situ, who conducted the post mortems and who had a three dimensional perspective of the scene in the bedroom, must be recognized. I agree, but it does not follow that his opinion must inevitably be preferred.  
    51   The fourth point notes the support of Dr Zillman for Dr Bradhurst’s view (that he favoured murder/suicide) and the reported agreement of his colleagues, Professor Hilton, Dr Duflou and Dr Botterill. The fifth point adds that the only other pathologist to be present at a post mortem was Dr Cooke and he was unable to reach a concluded view in favour of either murder/murder or murder/suicide. 
    52   The sixth point was that those experts who favoured the Crown case were reliant upon photographs to form their opinions. Dr Zillman who favoured the murder/suicide proposition was in the same situation. The point was essentially a corollary of the observations concerning the advantages of Dr Bradhurst. Reference was made to the criticism of the use of photographs by experts in R v Manley CCA unreported 15 December 1994 where it was said: 
     
      
       
       “Both commonsense and the observations of Dr Collins required the most careful consideration of the weight, and of the reservations called for as to the reliability, of any expert opinion based on suggested observations in the photographs and slides. The potential unsoundness of relying upon such an opinion, particularly where it was in conflict with or not supported by the qualified expert who examined the body and made the relevant histological examinations, is obvious.” 
       
      
    53   That extract of judgment must be assessed in the context of the issues then under examination. Whatever handicaps existed in the present case were explored in the evidence and I do not regard the statement in Manley as authority for the proposition that in every case in every circumstance, opinion based upon examination of photographs is to be treated as unsound. I did not understand the submission to advance to that point. It should be noted that much of the evidence given by the various pathologists was not evidence of what they observed either from inspection of the bodies or from photographs, but evidence of inferences by them, based on what it was common ground could be observed and therefore what had probably happened in the bedroom of the house, and it was open to the jury to take the view that no one of them, Dr Bradhurst included, was in a significantly better position to draw such inferences. 
    54   The final point adverted to asserted reliance on non medical matters and intuition. Reference was made to the absence of history about Snezana’s current medical condition and her family history but as noted in earlier analysis, there was no evidence that Snezana was affected by any relevant medical condition and the family history as described in the submission was to a significant extent fallacious. 
    55   I turn next to the twenty matters (additional to the foregoing) summarizing the submission that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
    56   First it was stated that “such was the state of the investigation” that no arrest was made for six months. I am unable to perceive how this would contribute to any indication about the safety of the verdicts. Presumably investigators had received the opinion of Dr Bradhurst and that would make it imprudent to pursue investigation with undue haste. The lack of haste of investigators is scarcely a test of the ultimate validity of what they discovered. 
    57   Next it was observed that there was no forensic evidence to link the appellant to the crime. Mention was made that there were some fingerprint markings on the handle of the knife suggesting that it was not wiped as one might expect if an attempt to avoid detection by that method were being made. Somewhat in counter balance to that observation however, the evidence shows that Snezana’s hands were heavily bloodied and if she had wielded the knife it became surprising that significant blood was not transferred to and did not remain upon the handle. 
    58   Third the evidence was that the appellant was to all appearances a good and loving father. No motive was established and Snezana’s announcement that she intended to leave (made, according to the appellant, for the first time on the Sunday) would provide an unconvincing motive for annihilating the family. Inability to determine motive has been a concomitant of horrendous crime not infrequently in reported history. It is not the duty of the jury to acquit when something of undoubted interest but not required to be established by the prosecution, remains shrouded in mystery. 
    59   Fourth the appellant voluntarily complied with requests to provide fingerprints, blood and hair samples and it was said that he therefore did not do anything other than assist police. It certainly can be said that he did not obstruct the police enquiries but whether he assisted them would be a conclusion dependent upon where the truth lies. 
    60   Fifth it was noted that investigators conducted a most comprehensive forensic examination of the house and the appellant’s clothing and there was “no result”. That consequence would be consistent with murder/suicide but most unexpected if murder/murder had taken place and the murderer needed to eliminate traces of his activities. 
    61   Sixth there was no evidence of attempted removal of bloodstains and the opinion of forensic examiners was that it is almost impossible to extinguish stains completely. 
    62   Seventh, the appellant had no background of violence or mental instability. 
    63   Eighth, no one inside or outside the house heard any sounds which “would have undoubtedly accompanied a murder”. The basis for this assumption is not apparent but it is true that neighbours were from time to time able to hear sounds emanating from the house and the building was not what might be described as acoustically sealed. The only occupants of the house who testified were the appellant and his father. 
    64   Ninth it was said that there was no evidence that the appellant had the opportunity or the capacity to return the house to “its pristine condition” after the event. The absence of opportunity is significantly dependent upon the credibility of the appellant’s assertion that he was in Zaklina’s room from 1pm on Sunday until 6 am on Monday. No direct testimony related to the appellant’s capacity as a housekeeper although, as earlier commented concerning the appearances on the video, someone had put the house into a virtual showroom condition with the exception of the bedrooms.  
    65   Tenth, having regard to the appellant’s background and labouring occupation it was said to be difficult to conceive how he could recreate the scene so as to delude the experts, including Dr Bradhurst in particular. 
    66   Eleventh, it was contended that if the offences were planned and the scene recreated it might have been expected to have been better done. Examples were suggested that the killings might have taken place away from the house; or a break-in might have been staged; or the parents removed beforehand or the knife placed in Snezana’s hands. These were, of course, recognized as speculations.  
    67   Twelfth, it was argued that if the appellant recreated the scene to give the appearance of suicide, it was inconsistent with that objective to be reluctant to discover the bodies and also inconsistent not to embrace the proposition of suicide when he was questioned by police. By the time of trial the appellant had however embraced the proposition that Snezana had suicided as is manifest in the extract of evidence set out above. 
    68   Thirteenth, it was observed that nothing incriminating derived from listening devices which were put in place or from interception of telephone calls. It might scarcely be expected that any murderer who had acted alone would discuss his crime although investigators may hope that something inconsistent with a posture adopted by a suspect could be said. The mere absence of useful product from listening devices and telephone intercepts would not logically cast doubt upon incriminating evidence.  
    69   Fourteenth, if the appellant was guilty he must have over an extended period maintained a charade of considerable effect. There is nothing to suggest that he had the talent to be a self possessed and clever actor: cf Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) supra. 
    70   Fifteenth, there was no evidence that the appellant knew how to gain access to the bedroom through the locked door. As mentioned already, the learned trial judge directed the jury that the appellant’s claim in this regard might well be true and the Crown argument that he lied about it had to be rejected. 
    71   Sixteenth, it was rhetorically asked why any murderer would arrange the bodies and risk the possibility of leaving clues (including the knife) at the scene.  
    72   Seventeenth, it was noted that the testimony of the appellant at trial was entirely consistent with his responses to lengthy and repeated interrogation by police. 
    73   Eighteenth, the appellant appeared to be grief stricken in the days following the deaths.  
    74   Nineteenth and twentieth, the submissions were reiterated that the Crown had failed to exclude the reasonable possibility that either Petre was responsible for murder/murder or that Snezana had murdered the children and then committed suicide. 
    75   Many of the propositions in the foregoing three groups were couched in negative and rhetorical terms. That is not said by way of criticism and such an approach is to be expected when the focus of argument is upon whether a hypothesis consistent with innocence has been excluded. There was and is no onus on the appellant to establish any such hypothesis. Nevertheless the matters raised do not in my view demonstrate that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant if it was open to them to find the Crown case proved. To be so open it was necessary for the jury to reject the opinion of Dr Bradhurst (supported by Dr Zillman) and be satisfied that murder/murder had been committed. That is not to suggest that it was open to the jury to convict on the basis of selected acceptance of forensic pathological opinion alone, this was not contended by the Crown and the jury were directed appropriately. 
    76   Some further observations should be made concerning the forensic material which gave rise to the difference of opinion among the experts.  
    77   When her body was found Snezana was wearing a pink coloured nightdress and a cream/white bed jacket as well as undergarments consisting of a brassiere and pants. The testing of heavy blood staining on the night dress and bed jacket revealed that fourteen examined areas on the back of the night dress produced readable results showing that five of the areas were Snezana’s blood; two of the areas were blood from Zaklina; four of the areas were blood from the twins and three areas were mixtures. Of the lastmentioned, the analyst identified one mixture as blood of Snezana and one of the children but she could not say which; one mixture was of blood from Snezana and Zaklina and the final mixture consisted of sources which she could not identify. The bed jacket produced seventeen readable results from testing blood staining on the back. Four areas originated from Snezana; three from Zaklina; three from the twins and seven areas were mixtures. Of the seven mixtures one was identifiable as sourced from Snezana and Zaklina; three contained contributions of Zaklina’s blood, and three were mixtures of which the source was unestablished. 
    78   There were also established test results from the fronts of the garments. No blood sourced from the twins was identified from the areas tested in the fronts. It was of considerable significance that the bodies were stacked with Snezana prone on top of the children, yet blood from all victims was on the back of both Snezana’s outer garments. The twins were identical and blood distinction between them was not possible and it would be futile to seek to distinguish whether particular blood came from Daniela or Dijana or vice versa. Another aspect of blood staining relates to the area of wall in the region of the bed head. There was blood spatter extending to an area which was behind the mattress and base which were positioned between the bedside tables. As senior counsel for the Crown observed, expertise was unnecessary to conclude that (even if the heavier observable staining could have resulted from blood passing under the base) that the upper spatter could only have been deposited if the mattress and base were away from the wall. The suggestion on behalf of the appellant that the bed may have been moved by police or ambulance lacks any support from the evidence. The blood on the plaster wall was examined after a section of the wall was cut out. Four areas were subjected to identification testing and all were sourced from Snezana. Although, as will later be mentioned, there were two major wounds to Snezana’s throat, there is obviously difficulty in attributing credence to the murder/suicide theory if it is her blood on the wall (as it was) and the bed has been moved back into place after that blood has been expelled from her stabbed body. 
    79   The next matter recorded before turning to some testimony of the pathologists is that, although the lower part of Snezana’s body was clear of the stack and all wounds were to the throat area, there appear three marks on the outer aspect of her left leg between knee and ankle level. These marks are more or less parallel and they are suggestive of fingermarks such as might be caused if the body was being grasped by a bloodied hand. (The marks are visible in photograph 16 of Exhibit B for example but they are far more clearly depicted in the video, Exhibit A). There is pathological opinion supportive of the view that those stains could have been caused by fingers. Snezana’s lower limbs were splayed well clear of the substantial blood pooling and soaking near the bedside table and bed head. 
    80   Dr Bradhurst supported the probability of murder/suicide. He expressed reliance upon a combination of factors and mentioned the “quietness” of the scene, the absence of apparent aftermath of struggle, the superficial cuts along the edges of the wounds and the absence of “defence” injury as matters pertinent to his opinion. His advantage as the first expert pathologist on the scene and as the performer of post mortems was recognized.  
    81   There were, however, aspects which were in my view capable of persuading a tribunal of fact acting reasonably to decline to rely upon Dr Bradhurst’s opinion that murder/suicide was probable or even possible. It could be regarded as significant that his opinions were initially formed, and subsequently adhered to without being aware that the blood on the night dress and jacket worn by Snezana included blood of the children on the parts already described. He accepted, as the jury might have, that if Snezana had been taken unawares the factors of quiet scene and absence of struggle or defence injuries might be expected in any case. There was contradiction between the experts as to whether the superficial cuts should be interpreted as hesitation wounds such as a suicide might make or simply products of the use of a weapon with an irregular blade such as the knife found at the scene.  
    82   When questioned about the results of testing of Snezana’s garments he gave this evidence first in relation to her own blood on the back of the clothing: 
     
      
       
       “Q. Can you offer any explanation as to how there is some of her blood on the back of her night jacket? 
        
       A. Yes. 
        
        
       Q. If she has committed suicide in that way? 
        
       A. If she did commit suicide - one scenario I suggest for that would be that, if in fact she did kill the babies and then commit suicide, that she had, in the process of committing her death, she was at first lying with her back on the floor and she had had some attempts at cutting her throat and with bleeding going on the floor and also at that time perhaps cutting her - into the wind pipe or her - below her thyroid cartilage into her airway and blood would have run down on to the floor and may well have got on to the back of her clothing in that way. I am suggesting she is taking some time to die, to go through the process of death or causing death. 
        
        
       Q. After she bleeds in that way, she stands up and falls forwards on to where the children where? 
        
       A. Yes, well she hadn’t managed to kill herself at first although there is considerable bleeding having occurred and also some spray from her cut vessel going on the furniture as it was seen and also her coughing blood from her airways and that projected cough blood going there but, more important, more blood going on the floor from the cut vessels, but then after a period of time finding that she still hadn’t died, to (sic) places the children in the position they were found and doing the final cuts on top of them in the way that she was found. 
        
        
       Q. Would she have the strength to get up and do that if she previously cut her throat and suffered a blood loss such as appeared on the back of her night jacket? 
        
       A. I believe that she would have been able to have the strength to do that because of recorded cases previously of witnessed suicide in this way, that there seems to be an extra reserve of strength that they have that they were able to do what to, I am sure, to you and to myself would seem amazing acts or feats.” 
       
      
    83   And second, in reference to that and the children’s blood being also on the back of the clothing he testified: 
     
      
       
       “The blood on the back of her clothing is hard to explain whether self-infliction or homicide. If her cut throat was self-inflicted after dealing with the children it is possible that the blood came from her holding the child and the babies to her shoulder after their throats had been cut and/or during the act.” 
       
      
    84   It was uncontradicted evidence that Snezana’s throat was cut by two deep wounds (both, if the murder/suicide theory be correct, inflicted by herself) one penetrating about 5 mm into cervical disc 5-6 and the other penetrating about 20 mm into cervical disc 4-5. No one purported to be able to determine which of those two wounds was inflicted first. 
    85   The jury also had evidence of the blood spatter and the conclusion that the bed had been moved after Snezana’s blood was deposited on the wall. In my view, the jury was entitled to regard the above explanations concerning the blood as incredible and Dr Bradhurst’s evidence as being insufficient to raise any doubt about the conclusion that what had occurred was murder/murder rather than murder/suicide. 
    86   Support for Dr Bradhurst had been given by Dr Zillman. As confirmed in his testimony his opinion was dependent upon a hypothesis that the wounds to Snezana’s throat were inflicted in two separate stages and to coordinate that circumstance, inter alia, with the blood on the back of her clothing he proposed that (wounded in the throat) she would have been on her back when she “re-arranged the children” and “it is likely she rolled back onto her knees”. A reading of the examination and cross examination of the witness reveals less than convincing responses particularly to challenges offered in cross examination.  
    87   I am unpersuaded that it would be unreasonable for the jury to discard Dr Zillman’s opinion. The firmest rejection of the murder/suicide theory can be perceived in the evidence of Dr Oettle. In recapitulating the reasons for his opinion that Snezana was the victim of homicide he mentioned factors such as the lack of evidence of spray of her blood over the bodies of the children, the appearance that the nightdress was displaced and which signified movement of the body after decease, the bloodstains on the leg which were consistent with being caused by a hand, a rearwards displacement of a hair clip such as would accompany someone taking hold of the woman by the hair of her head, the incompatibility of her heavily bloodstained hands with the comparatively little blood on the knife handle and blood smears about the buttock of her night dress which would have been most unlikely to have been made by her.  
    88   Dr Oettle opined that the murder/suicide thesis was contradicted by the presence of the blood of both Snezana and the children on the back of her clothing and (with the exception of one site) the absence of the children’s blood from the front of her clothing. It is to be remembered that if the murder/suicide theory is possibly correct the children must have been killed and then Snezana suicided above their bloodied bodies. 
    89   Dr Collins expressed considerable doubt about the self infliction theory. He made reference to a variety of factors and there was, as would be expected, coincidence of reference amongst the experts to many factors whether or not their ultimate views coincided. Dr Collins adverted to conjunction of factors mentioning asphyxial type petechial haemorrhages, perceived bruising and abrasions particularly abrasion located above the right margin of the deeper neck wound, the involvement of the spinal cord in the wound, an injury to the right thenar eminence (an unlikely self inflicted cut by a right handed person such as Snezana wielding a knife), the damage to necklaces still around the neck (a suicide would be likely to bare the target area in contrast with an attacker who takes a victim as found), a perceived inconsistency between the position of the body when found and the distribution of blood, the absence of the children’s blood from the cuffs of the night dress, the heavily bloodied hands contrasted with the small staining of the knife handle and the raised situation of Zaklina’s leg which he thought attributable to rigor mortis and, as it was unsupported by Snezana’s body, an indication that Zaklina’s body had been moved after rigor mortis developed, that is some time after death. 
    90   The lastmentioned was the subject of extensive enquiry at trial and it provoked expression of diverse views. In isolation it was not determinative of any issue at trial but one of the many factors and complexities which were analysed by the witnesses and ultimately were for assessment by the jury. 
    91   Professor Mason was consulted as a result of a letter (Exhibit AA) from Dr Bradhurst (with whose opinion he ultimately did not concur) to the solicitor with carriage of the matter on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The content of the letter read in relevant part: 
     
      
       
       “During a recent visit overseas, the Director of this Institute (NSW Institute of Forensic Medicine) Professor John Hilton, discussed pathology findings in the Velevska deaths with Emeritus Professor of Forensic Medicine, Professor J.K. Mason, of the University of Edinburgh. 
       
      
      
       
       Professor Mason showed considerable interest in the case and expressed willingness to give his opinion on the pathology findings if requested to do so.” 
       
      
    92   Professor Hilton was one of the pathologists mentioned by Detective Whyte as having indicated agreement in the views held by Dr Bradhurst. The circumstances were counter suggestive that Professor Mason’s opinion was sought with any particular expectation that they might support the Crown’s charge against the appellant. His ultimate opinion was that the cutting of Snezana’s throat was probably homicidal. Part of his evidence included: 
     
      
       
       “I thought perhaps the most significant aspect of the scene is the distribution of arterial blood spatter on the wall and bedside chest. All the blood, as I said, was from Snezana and all is low down. In my opinion, the distribution of the bloodstains is directed on the wall, very directional on the side of the locker and moderately directional on the front of the locker. All that places Snezana with near certainty, to my way of thinking, on the floor where the bed now stands and in front of the locker when her throat was cut. It follows that, in my view, both she and the bed must have been moved later.” 
       
      
    93   Dr Cooke stated that he could not form a preference for murder/murder rather than murder/suicide. Like his colleagues he was examined and cross examined about factors which could be argued pro and con those theories. 
    94   The essence of the issue raised by the appellant in respect of ground 6 is whether the evidence as a whole when examined by this Court was such as that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. The Crown case did not assert that conviction could follow acceptance of supporting pathological evidence alone and the case was not left to the jury by his Honour on such a basis. Once it is determined that it was open to the jury to discard the murder/suicide theory beyond reasonable doubt, it follows that it was reasonably open to find murder/murder proved. The acceptance of evidence of pathological evidence in support of murder/murder establishes that Snezana (and the children) were murdered by someone and what remained for the Crown was to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the perpetrator.  
    95   The onus and standard of proof prevent any criminal trial from being a mere contest between two bodies of evidence supporting contrary conclusions and the rejection of one body of evidence does not equate to proof of the other. Nevertheless, in this case the occurrence of crime (murder/murder) was capable of being proved by the unqualified rejection of one (murder/suicide) of two competing hypotheses. A third possibility of death by accident can be regarded as fanciful. 
    96   The remaining question therefore was whether it was open to the jury in the sense that that expression bears in accordance with authority to find that the circumstantial evidence proved that the appellant was the perpetrator. 
    97   The circumstantial case was centred upon activity (and inactivity) of the appellant at relevant times. I refer to matters germane to proof that the appellant was responsible for the killings which were in my view open to be found by the jury. 
    98   The appellant’s assertion that he was in Zaklina’s bedroom from 1pm on Sunday until 6 am on Monday was vulnerable and capable of being reasonably rejected (Dr Bradhurst’s assessment that the deaths occurred 9 pm and 5 am was not disputed). Thus the unbroken stay in Zaklina’s bedroom, if true, operated to provide the appellant with an established alibi. The claim was undermined by various evidence. It may have been regarded as inherently unlikely that the appellant would spend 17 hours in a room without ever emerging for the purpose of food, drink or toilet. He conceded in evidence that he had had his usual quota of sleep on Saturday night rising at about 8.30 am on Sunday after retiring after midnight. He had never slept for 17 hours even after working triple shifts and he said he had no idea why he slept for so long and he specifically did not attribute the occurrence to any feeling of depression or the like. His usual pattern was to sleep for 7 hours. In addition to the inherent unlikelihood of sleeping for that length of time, the evidence of Dr King mentioned above was that it was very unlikely that the appellant would have slept for that period.  
    99   There were significant contradictions of the appellant’s claim in this regard in evidence of others about conversations he had with them close to the time of the events. For example, Toda Glavevski gave evidence that in a telephone call on the Monday evening the appellant mentioned that he had been in the loungeroom at about 5 o’clock when Snezana made “milk for the kids” and went back into the room. And Ana Jorge who lived at 11 Castle Court saw her husband who had returned from work at 2.40 pm on Monday later answer the door to the appellant. She approached during their conversation and heard the appellant say that (Snezana) was locked in her room (at) 7 o’clock in the afternoon but came out at 8 at night because she was hungry and wanted something to eat. It was for the jury to assess the credibility of the witnesses and the appellant’s assertions that his remarks had been misunderstood or misinterpreted. 
    100   Petre Velevski gave corroborating evidence on this topic but it was opposed to what he had told police shortly after the events including that he had had dinner with the appellant at about 8 pm on the Sunday evening. The appellant had also told police on 20 June that he recalled seeing Snezana packing the Monday school lunch for Zaklina. According to the evidence of Petre this school lunch preparation occurred on the Sunday evening. 
    101   Not only was it open to the jury to reject the claim that the appellant was in the bedroom for 17 hours, I am of further opinion that it could reasonably be concluded that the appellant’s assertion was a lie told in consciousness of guilt. It is not necessary to recapitulate the matters canvassed concerning ground 3. 
    102   Next the appellant had given evidence that when he got up on Monday morning and knocked on the bedroom door he did not then think that Snezana might not be there, in other words he believed that she was inside the (locked) bedroom. In these early hours the appellant asked his parents to leave the house and he gave evidence that his intention was to remain on his own with his wife so that he could find out what was the matter. Given that state of mind and the absence of any reason for thinking to the contrary, it must have been appreciated that it was highly improbable that Snezana would be anywhere else than in the bedroom. There was evidence that she did not drive a motor car and if she were to leave the house she would need to have taken with her a six year old and three month old twins. If they were left behind unattended (and alive) their presence would hardly have remained undetected. 
    103   The significance of the appellant’s belief that Snezana was in the bedroom was that the jury might well consider that the appellant’s conduct in not continuing to knock on the door, not calling out, not attempting to look under the door (as Constable English was able to do) and not attempting by some means to obtain access to the room was inexplicable except on the basis that he knew what was to be found in the bedroom. 
    104   The departure of the appellant’s parents occurred in quite extraordinary circumstances. They were asked to leave at about 6 am. It was still dark and a winter’s day. Tasa was old, in poor health and had to be woken in order to be required to depart the house. The background showed that Petre and Tasa had migrated to Australia in mid 1989 and had lived continuously with the appellant and his family, first at their house at Cringila and later at Castle Court, the only break being a short time when the parents had left the home at Cringila. 
    105   It was open to the jury to reject the explanation that the removal of the parents from the home was explicable on the basis claimed by the appellant particularly as his later conduct did not reveal realistic pursuit of his wife in order to find out what was the matter.  
    106   The appellant claimed to be genuinely seeking to communicate with his wife whom he believed was in the bedroom but his conduct was inconsistent. He took his parents to his sister’s home but on return to Castle Court he did not make any attempt to communicate through the bedroom door or to see if it could be opened or indeed to see if his wife, as he previously believed was still there.  
    107   On the Monday the appellant told a number of persons that he had received advice from a social worker (Mrs Nicolovska) that he should not try to find his wife for 24 hours, the recipients of this assertion included his sister Rada Nadjovski and Mr and Mrs Jorge. In fact Mrs Nicolovska who was a social worker at the Macedonian Welfare Association said that in a conversation with the appellant she had done no more than suggest that if he had not heard from his wife and children by about 3 o’clock he should contact the police.  
    108   The appellant in the course of perambulations on the Monday called at Zaklina’s school to see if she was there, producing notes which he said he had found in her school bag explaining her absence from school on the previous Friday. The appellant must have known that Zaklina had not been taken to school by her grandfather in accordance with the ordinary routine as he had taken his parents to his sister’s place. If Zaklina had gone to school then he was aware that she was without her school bag which was at home. It was open to the jury to find that calling at the school was not part of any genuine attempt to locate his daughter. 
    109   An extraordinary omission by the appellant was the absence of attempt to ascertain whether his wife (if he had departed from the belief that she was in the bedroom) was at her parents’ home. Both his sister Rada Najovski and the social worker Mrs Nicolovska had suggested that he should enquire there. It would not be surprising if the jury regarded his testimony that he did not know the telephone number of his parents in law as specious but in any event he knew where the house was, had transport and had been there the previous day in order to collect Zaklina who apparently spent weekends with her maternal grandparents frequently. 
    110   There was ample evidence from which it could be concluded that the appellant was not making a genuine attempt to find his wife and that the reason for this was that he knew where she was to be found. Important to this assessment would be the credibility of the appellant’s explanation and in these regards the advantage of the jury who could see and assess the appellant must be acknowledged. 
    111   The extensive submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant confirm that there was an arguable case to be advanced on his behalf but to say that an accused person has an arguable case is not the same as saying that there must be a rational hypothesis consistent with innocence. Nor, because it is perceptible that an accused person had an arguable case, does it follow that a jury ought reasonably have a doubt about guilt. 
    112   The argument before the court largely proceeded in terms of evidence analysis as the foregoing would reflect. It is important not to overlook the supervisory function of this court as distinct from the primary function of the trial court to assess the evidence. An arguable case does not cease to be an arguable case because it has been rejected but this provides no warrant for necessary intervention. The principles upon which intervention may be provoked have been authoritatively discussed, convenient references being found in Fleming v The Queen supra. Recognition of the jury’s potential and actual advantages cannot be omitted. In dealing with a suggestion that there was no practical difference between a doubt entertained by an appellate court or one which a reasonable jury ought to entertain (Ratten v The Queen 1974 131 CLR 510) Dawson J (with the concurrence of Gibbs CJ and Brennan J) wrote: 
     
      
       
       “With the greatest of respect for the view expressed by his Honour, it does not appear to me to be circumlocution to speak in terms of a doubt which ought to have been entertained by any reasonable jury rather than in terms of a doubt which the court has. 
       
      
      
       
       In many cases it may be unnecessary to make such a distinction because a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a reasonable jury ought also to have experienced. But the evidence before the appellate court will seldom, if ever, be in the same form as the evidence before the jury. In particular, a court of appeal does not usually have the opportunity to assess the worth of a witness’s evidence by seeing and hearing that evidence given. Moreover, the jury performs its function within the atmosphere of the particular trial which it may not be possible to reproduce upon appeal. These considerations point to important differences between the functions of a jury and those of a court of appeal. A jury is able, and is required, to evaluate the evidence in a manner in which a court of appeal cannot.”  
       Whitehorn v The Queen 
        1983 152 CLR 660. 
       
      
    113   Brennan CJ returned to cite this in Jones v The Queen 1997 72 ALJR 78 and add: 
     
      
       
       “I adhere to that view because the function of a court of criminal appeal is prescribed by statute and the statute is founded on the principle that the jury, not the court, is the constitutional arbiter of guilt. An equation between a reasonable doubt entertained by a court of criminal appeal and a doubt which ought to have been entertained by a reasonable jury is valid only if the capacity for evaluating the cogency of a witness’s evidence and the worldly wisdom of a court of criminal appeal are no less than the collective endowments of a jury. Those skills are as material to the propriety of a verdict as the advantages of seeing and hearing witnesses and sensing the atmosphere of a trial. It is a basic assumption of the criminal process that those skills are not equally shared by judges and juries. Exceptionally, judicial experience is sometimes accorded greater weight than the experience of a jury, in which case a trial judge is required to give the jury a warning that alerts them to what judicial experience has shown. Otherwise the courts accept the jury as the possessor of both the skills and the advantages that are required to reach a proper verdict. In my respectful opinion, any contrary approach denies the importance of trial by jury and is inconsistent with the constitutional function which the jury performs.” 
       
      
    114   Whilst it is imperative that rejection of the credibility of testimony of an accused be not mistaken for proof of Crown assertion, in the present case it was a critical advantage for the jury to assess whether any credence should be given to the testimony of the appellant and his father. That evidence was reasonably open to rejection and the judgment of the jury in the acceptance of evidence and the conclusions reached have not been shown to be flawed.  
    115   In the terms of s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act I am unpersuaded that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, neither is it established that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of wrong decision on any question of law nor, finally, do I perceive any ground demonstrating that there has been a miscarriage of justice. 
    116   I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the convictions.

     REGINA v LJUBE VELEVSKI 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
    117   JAMES J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of Grove J and Kirby J. I agree with Grove J, as does Kirby J, that grounds of appeal 2 - 5 inclusive should be rejected, for the reasons given by Grove J. I also agree with Grove J, generally for the reasons given by his Honour, that the sixth ground of appeal (in which the first ground of appeal can be subsumed) should be rejected. However, as Kirby J is of the contrary opinion, I consider that I should myself state, fairly succinctly, some of the principal matters which have led me to my conclusion.  
    118   The Crown case at the trial fell into two parts:- 
     
      
       
       (1) The circumstantial case. 
       
      
      
       
       (2) The medical case. 
       
      
    119   As to the circumstantial case, the jury could, in my opinion, have been satisfied that all of the following circumstances (inter alia) had been established. 
    120   (1) The appellant was not, as he alleged, in Zaklina’s bedroom at all times between about 1 o’clock in the afternoon of Sunday 19 June and about 6 o’clock in the morning of Monday 20 June but, on the contrary, was at least for part of this period elsewhere in the house and hence the appellant did not have an alibi and did have an opportunity to murder his wife and children. 
    121   The appellant gave evidence in his evidence in chief at the trial that he was in Zaklina’s bedroom from about 1 pm on Sunday 19 June to about 6 am on Monday 20 June. The appellant gave evidence in cross-examination that he never left Zaklina’s bedroom to get anything to eat or drink or to go to the toilet. It is true that the appellant sometimes did not assert that he had been asleep for all the time he had spent in Zaklina’s bedroom. However, his evidence was predominantly to the effect that he had spent all of the period mentioned in Zaklina’s bedroom, at least much of it asleep.  
    122   The appellant’s father, Petre Velevski, gave evidence in his evidence in chief that the appellant was in Zaklina’s bedroom during the same period, that is from 1 pm on 19 June to 6 am on 20 June. 
    123   This evidence by the appellant and his father, if the jury considered that it was true or might reasonably possibly be true, would have provided the appellant with an alibi. Dr Bradhurst expressed the opinion, which was not challenged, that the victims had died at some time between 9 pm on 19 June and 5 am on 20 June. 
    124   Kirby J disputes that the evidence of the appellant and his father can properly be described as evidence of alibi. It does not seem to me to really matter what label is attached to the evidence. However, in my view, the evidence can properly be described as evidence of alibi. The evidence, if accepted, would have established that the appellant was elsewhere than in the matrimonial bedroom at the time when the appellant’s wife and children died, even if he was still somewhere in the same house.  
    125   In my opinion, it was well open to the jury to conclude that the appellant’s evidence was not true and that there was no reasonable possibility that it was true. 
     
      
     (a) It was inherently unlikely that the appellant would have spent seventeen hours in one room, without leaving it, even to get a drink or get something to eat or go to the toilet. 
      
      
     (b) The appellant’s usual sleeping pattern was to sleep for seven hours.  
      
      
     (c) The appellant had never previously slept for seventeen hours, even after working triple shifts. 
      
      
     (d) The appellant had no idea why he had slept so long on this occasion. 
      
      
     (e) The appellant had had his usual quota of sleep on the previous night and had got up only at about 8.30 on the Sunday morning. He had gone to bed at about 1 o’clock on the Sunday morning.  
      
      
     (f) The appellant told police that after sleeping in Zaklina’s bed all he had done to the bed was to fold back the top cover, yet photographs of the bed taken by the police were inconsistent with an adult having spent many hours sleeping in the bed. 
      
      
     (g) Dr King, a neurologist, expressed the opinion that it was very unlikely that the appellant would have fallen asleep and have remained asleep for such a lengthy period, particularly as he had got up from his previous night’s sleep only about five hours before 1 pm on 19 June. 
      
      
     (h) When interviewed by Detective McGrath on 20 June, the appellant said “I saw her (Snezana) packing the lunch (for Zaklina)” for school on Monday 20 June, which, according to Petre Velevski’s evidence, had happened on the evening of Sunday 19 June. 
      
    126   In my opinion, it was well open to the jury to conclude that Petre Velevski’s evidence was not true and that there was no reasonable possibility that it was true. His evidence was quite contrary to what he had said in a statement given to the police on 20 June 1994 in a passage which was read aloud to him during an electronically recorded interview on 4 July 1994, that on the Sunday evening he had had dinner with his son, the appellant, at about 8 o’clock. Having read Petre Velevski’s cross-examination, I would not accept, nor do I consider that a jury would have accepted, that what he said to the police on 20 June 1994 was the result of confusion on his part. 
    127   (2) The appellant’s assertion that he was in Zaklina’s bedroom between 1 pm on 19 June and 6 am on 20 June was a lie told in consciousness of guilt. The trial judge left this alleged lie to the jury, as being capable of being a lie told in consciousness of guilt. In my opinion, it was well open to the jury to be satisfied that the appellant’s evidence about being in Zaklina’s bedroom was untrue, that it was a deliberate lie, that it related to a material matter and that it was told out of consciousness of guilt and a fear that if the truth emerged it would implicate him in the deaths of the victims. Whether or not he was asleep for all of the time is less important than the assertion that he was continuously in a room in the house, other than the room in which the bodies were found.  
    128   (3) At the time the appellant got up on the morning of 20 June and knocked on the bedroom door, he believed that Snezana was in the bedroom. The appellant gave evidence that he did not at that time think she might not be there. The appellant’s stated reason for asking his parents to leave the house on the morning of 20 June was “so I would remain on my own with her to find out what was the matter”. It was highly improbable that Snezana would be anywhere else than in the bedroom. Snezana was a non-driver, who had the care of three month old twins and a six year old daughter.  
    129   The significance of the appellant’s belief that Snezana was in the bedroom is that the jury could consider that the appellant’s conduct (or lack of conduct) in not continuing to knock on the door, in not calling out, in not attempting to look under the door (as the police later did) or in not attempting by some means, with or without the assistance of others, to obtain access to the room, was inexplicable, except on the basis that the appellant already knew what had happened to Snezana and the children in the bedroom. 
    130   (4) In the early morning of 20 June 1994 the appellant caused his parents to leave the house, hurriedly and without any prior warning to them. 
    131   The appellant’s parents had migrated to Australia in July 1989 and had subsequently continuously lived with the appellant and Snezana, firstly in their house at Cringilla and then in their house at Berkeley, except that on one occasion at Cringilla the parents had left voluntarily for a short time. 
    132   The parents were asked to leave at about 6 o’clock in the morning. It was winter and very dark. The appellant’s mother was old and unwell and had to be woken. The explanation given by the appellant was that, if he took his parents away from the house, his wife might speak to him. 
    133   In my opinion, the jury would have been warranted in reasoning that the precipitate ejection of the parents from the home at such an early hour, was not to be explained on the basis suggested by the appellant (particularly having regard to his later conduct) but could only be explained on the basis that there was some extraordinary reason known to the appellant for getting his parents out of the house. I do not agree that this conduct of the appellant cannot be regarded as incriminatory, because it occurred after, and not before, the deaths.  
    134   (5) After the appellant returned to his home, after taking his parents to his sister’s house, and notwithstanding his evidence that his purpose in taking his parents to his sister’s house was to help him communicate with Snezana, the appellant made no attempt to communicate with her or even to check whether she was still in the bedroom. The appellant did not attempt to knock on the door of the bedroom, the appellant did not try to open the door, the appellant did not try to look under the door and the appellant had “no idea” whether the door was still locked. 
    135   In my opinion, it was open to the jury to infer that the lack of any attempt on the appellant’s part to check whether Snezana was still in the bedroom was explicable only on the basis that the appellant knew what had happened to Snezana in the bedroom. 
    136   (6) The appellant, notwithstanding his denials, in fact knew how to open the bedroom door, even if it was locked. 
    137   It is true that the appellant gave evidence that he did not know how to open the bedroom door, if it was locked, without actually breaking down the door. He said, “nobody told me how they (the doors) were opened”. 
    138   Evidence about the locks to the rooms in the house was given by Mr Zizic, the builder of the house, and Ms Arundell, a locksmith. Mr Zizic gave evidence that he explained how the locks worked to Snezana. Ms Arundell gave evidence that she inspected the locks on 27 June 1994. The lock to the main bedroom had been destroyed (by the police when they forced entry on 20 June). All the locks in the bedrooms were the same. Each bedroom could be locked from the inside. However, there was a “pretty obvious” slot in the front of the door and the door could be unlocked from the outside by inserting “anything”, such as a coin or a paddle pop stick, in the slot. 
    139   The Crown sought at the trial to rely on the appellant’s evidence that he did not know how to open a locked bedroom door from the outside, as being a lie told in consciousness of guilt. The trial judge declined to leave this matter to the jury as a lie told in consciousness of guilt, saying “that may well have been true. There is no direct evidence at any rate that anyone told him how to open the door from the outside by putting a screw driver or paddle pop stick in”. 
    140   Notwithstanding what the trial judge said, I consider it was open to the jury to infer that it was not true that the appellant did not know how to open a door, if it was locked. The appellant had lived in the house for more than eighteen months. All the internal locks in the house were similar and the locking mechanism was simple and easy to operate, as was demonstrated to the court on the hearing of the appeal. There was evidence from Petre Velevski that on one occasion six year old Zaklina had opened a locked bedroom door from the outside. The appellant admitted in cross-examination that Petre Velevski had said something to him about Zaklina opening and locking a door. If the jury did infer that the appellant knew how to open a locked bedroom door, that would be a crucial matter adverse to him. 
    141   (7) On 20 June the appellant falsely told a number of persons including Ratka Nadjovski, Mrs Jorge or Mr Jorge that he had been told by the social worker Mrs Nikolovska that he could not try to find his wife for twenty-four hours, that he should wait twenty-four hours before doing anything, that he must wait for twenty-four hours before calling the police. 
    142   Mrs Nikolovska, a social worker from the Macedonian Welfare Association, gave evidence that in her conversation with the appellant on the morning of 20 June she had merely suggested that if the appellant had not heard from his wife and children by about 3 o’clock in the afternoon he should contact the police. 
    143   (8) The appellant went to Zaklina’s school and enquired of her teacher Ms Dimitrovski whether Zaklina was at school; yet he handed to Ms Dimitrovski two notes, saying that he had found the notes in Zaklina’s school bag. Ms Dimitrovski thought it was “odd”. It was open to the jury to conclude that the appellant’s enquiry of Ms Dimitrovski was not a genuine enquiry, when he knew that Zaklina’s school bag was at home. 
    144   (9) The appellant did not attempt to ascertain whether his wife was at her parents’ place. The appellant’s sister Ratka suggested to the appellant that Snezana might have gone to her parents’ place. The social worker Mrs Nikolovska made a similar suggestion. 
    145   The reason the appellant gave for not making an enquiry of Snezana’s parents was that he did not have Snezana’s parents’ telephone number. The jury would have been entitled to regard this as a specious excuse. The appellant had been to Snezana’s parents’ place the previous morning in order to pick up Zaklina and could easily have driven to the parents’ place. If Snezana was not at the home at Berkeley, the next most likely place for her to be would be her parents’ house. The jury were entitled to conclude that the appellant was not making any genuine attempt to find his wife and that he was not making any genuine attempt because he already knew where his wife was. 
    146   As to the medical case, the pathologists’ evidence was of course voluminous and I propose to refer only to some aspects of the evidence of each of the pathologists. Kirby J is of the opinion that some of the evidence given by the pathologists ought not to have been admitted. However, it was not objected to at the trial and it was not contended on the hearing of the appeal that it should not have been admitted. It seems to me that it was almost inevitable in the present case that the evidence given by each pathologist should include a statement by him of the factors (if any) which in his opinion tended to show that Snezana’s death was homicidal and the factors (if any) which in his opinion tended to show that Snezana’s death was suicidal and that the conclusion which the pathologist favoured as to whether the death was homicidal or suicidal would necessarily be clearly implicit, even if not expressly stated, in his evidence. Under s 80 of the Evidence Act evidence of opinion is not inadmissible only because it is about a fact in issue or an ultimate issue in the proceeding. It also seems to me almost inevitable that the pathologist would include in his statement of the factors tending to support one conclusion rather than the other, matters which he had observed and which in his opinion tended to support one conclusion rather than the other, even if such factors would have been observable and their significance might have been capable of being appreciated by a person without special training. It would in any event be a very difficult task to attempt to disentangle from the evidence the pathologists gave which was undoubtedly admissible, such parts of the evidence they gave as ought not to have been admitted, even assuming, which I do not decide, that there were parts of their evidence which ought not to have been admitted.  
    147   Dr Bradhurst 
     
      
     Dr Bradhurst did have the advantages of having observed the bodies in situ and of having conducted the post-mortem examination of the bodies. He was accordingly in a better position than the other pathologists (except, to some extent, Dr Cooke), who had to rely on photographs in order to make observations about the bodies. For example, Dr Bradhurst’s evidence that he found no evidence of bruising to the lips or gums of Snezana should, I think, be given greater weight than the evidence of the other pathologists who were interpreting what they believed they saw in photographs, as being evidence of bruising. However, much of the evidence given by the various pathologists was not evidence of what they observed, either from direct inspection of the bodies or from the photographs of the bodies, but evidence of inferences by them, based on what it was common ground could be observed, about what had probably happened in the bedroom of the house and the jury could take the view that Dr Bradhurst was not in any better position, or not in any significantly better position, to draw such inferences. 
      
    148   There were two deep cuts to the cervical spine of Snezana, one penetrating about 5 millimetres into disc C5-6 and the other penetrating about 20 millimetres into disc C4-5. There was no way, simply by looking at the wounds, of determining which cut was inflicted first. 
    149   Dr Bradhurst was of the opinion that Snezana’s cut throat had been self-inflicted. The factors relied on by Dr Bradhurst were:- 
     
      
     (a) A quiet scene 
      
      
     (b) No evidence of a struggle 
      
      
     (c) The presence of superficial cuts along the edges of the main wounds 
      
      
     (d) The absence of any defence type injury. 
      
    150   However, Dr Bradhurst conceded that, if Snezana had been taken unawares or while asleep, he would not have expected anything other than a quiet scene and would not have expected evidence of a struggle or defence type injuries. 
    151   It is important to note that Dr Bradhurst first formed his opinion that Snezana’s cut throat had been self-inflicted, at a time when, although he was aware of the presence of blood on the back upper part of her nightdress and jacket, he was not aware of the grouping of that blood. 
    152   The analyst Ms Beilby gave evidence that testing of the back of Snezana’s nightdress showed five areas of blood coming from Snezana, two areas of blood coming from Zaklina, four areas coming from the twins and three areas which were mixtures of blood types. The testing of the back of the bed jacket showed four areas of blood coming from Snezana, three areas of blood coming from Zaklina, three areas of blood coming from the twins and seven areas which were mixtures. Testing of the fronts of the nightdress and the jacket showed that almost all the blood tested came from Snezana. 
    153   If Snezana had killed the children, assembled the children’s bodies and then committed suicide by cutting her own throat, thus falling forward prone on the bodies of the children, there would be no explanation for the presence of either Snezana’s blood or the children’s blood on the back of Snezana’s nightdress and jacket. 
    154   Dr Bradhurst offered as an explanation for Snezana’s blood being on the back of her clothing: 
     
      
       
       “If she did commit suicide - one scenario I suggest for that would be that… in the process of committing her death she was at first lying with her back on the floor and she had had some attempts at cutting her throat and with bleeding going on the floor… she is taking some time to die… she hadn’t managed to kill herself at first, although there is considerable bleeding having occurred and also some spray from her cut vessel going on the furniture as it was seen and also her coughing blood from her airways and that projected cough blood going there but, more important, more blood going on the floor from the cut vessels, but then after a period of time finding that she still hadn’t died, (she) places the children in the position they were found and doing the final cuts on top of them in the way that she was found”. 
       
      
    155   Dr Bradhurst offered as an explanation for the children’s blood being on the back of Snezana’s clothing:- 
     
      
       
       “If her cut throat was self-inflicted after dealing with the children it is possible the blood came from her holding the child and the babies to her shoulder after their throats had been cut and/or during the act”.  
       
      
    156   It was clear from the blood splatter, including blood from Snezana, that the bed in the bedroom had been moved by someone after Snezana had been wounded in the neck. On Dr Bradhurst’s explanation, the bed would have to have been moved by Snezana herself. I do not find the suggestion that the bed might have been moved by one of the ambulance officers at all plausible. 
    157   It seems to me that it was open to the jury to regard both of Dr Bradhurst’s attempted explanations as being far fetched and highly improbable and this is the view I myself have formed. It was open to the jury to conclude that Snezana was killed first, that she lay prone on the floor bleeding profusely and that the children were killed over her body, thus explaining the presence of the children’s blood on the back of her clothing. 
    158   Dr Cooke 
     
      
     Dr Cooke viewed the bodies on 25 June 1994.  
      
    159   Although Dr Cooke considered that the medical evidence alone was not conclusive he said in his evidence that he had identified the following as “areas of concern”. 
     
      
     (i) Blood on the back of Snezana’s matinee jacket. This would not be consistent with Snezana having fallen forward after cutting her own throat. 
      
      
     (ii) Blood on the buttock regions of Snezana’s nightdress. The presence of this blood would not be consistent with Snezana having committed suicide and some of the blood stains had angulated profiles, which might represent the wiping of an instrument. 
      
      
     (iii) Blood stains on Snezana’s left calf, which could have been caused by fingers. 
      
      
     (iv) As the bodies were found, the head and neck of Snezana overlay Zaklina and the twins and one would have expected an extensive flow of blood from Snezana over Zaklina and the twins; yet there was little blood staining on Zaklina’s red vest or the backs of the babies’ sleeping bags. 
      
      
     (v) The distribution of blood spray on the back wall of the bedroom and the furniture showed that Snezana had suffered a cut throat injury when her neck was very close to the floor, closer to the floor than the position of her neck when her body was found. 
      
      
     (vi) Two buttons were missing from Snezana’s jacket, each with residual threads, and although a third button was intact, there was tearing of the button hole. These factors might indicate a struggle. 
      
      
     (vii) The observed cut to the thenar eminence near the right thumb could be a defence injury. 
      
      
     (viii) Several necklaces were still around Snezana’s neck.  
      
      
       
       “Suicidal injury by cutting is typically associated with baring, that is exposure of the part”. 
       
      
      
     (ix) There were characteristics of the cut throat injury to Snezana’s neck which did not usually occur in cases of suicide. The cuts were oblique and not transverse, the cuts were low and not high on Snezana’s neck, and the cut penetrating 20 millimetres into the spine was very deep. The superficial cuts to Snezana’s neck could indicate suicide but similar cuts could be seen around the neck wound of Zaklina, who clearly had not committed suicide. 
      
      
     (x) The petechial haemorrhages around Snezana’s eyes and the crescent shaped scratch to the front of Snezana’s neck could indicate compression of her neck, that is that she had been strangled. Dr Cooke doubted that the haemorrhages could have occurred after death, because, if they had, he would have expected to see intense lividity, whereas there was only limited lividity, and also a mixture of fine and coarse haemorrhages, whereas there were not any coarse haemorrhages. 
      
    160   Dr Collins 
     
      
     Dr Collins had “considerable doubt” about the self-infliction theory. 
      
    161   In his first report Dr Collins referred to:- 
     
      
     (i) The totality and variety of the wounds to Snezana’s neck. 
      
      
     (ii) The abrasion to the front of Snezana’s neck which might have been caused by a finger nail of a hand around her neck. 
      
      
     (iii) The petechial haemorrhages, which were more likely to have been asphyxial than post mortem gravitational. If the haemorrhages were asphyxial, they would have occurred before Snezana’s throat was cut and the circulation of her blood stopped. 
      
      
     (iv) If there was bruising to the right scalp and the lips and gums, this would not be common in suicides. I do not consider that this is a strong point, if respect is to be paid (as I have suggested) to Dr Bradhurst’s advantage in observing the condition of Snezana’s body. 
      
      
     (v) The cut to the thenar eminence on the right hand could be a defensive wound. It was not likely that a right-handed person, such as Snezana, would cut her own right hand. 
      
      
     (vi) The scene appeared quiet and undisturbed but this might be due to a re-arranging of the scene before the police attended. 
      
    162   In his second report Dr Collins expressed the opinion that in all probability Snezana’s wounds were not self-inflicted. The factors, which were to be taken in conjunction with each other were:- 
     
      
     A. The asphyxial type petechial haemorrhages. 
      
      
     B. The bruising to Snezana’s face, which Dr Collins conceded was not proven 
      
      
     C. The bruise to the scalp. 
      
      
     D. The abrasion to the front of the neck 
      
      
     E. The irregular abrasions above the right margin of the deep neck wound 
      
      
     F. The involvement of the spinal cord, i.e. the depth of one of the neck wounds 
      
      
     G. The injury to the thenar eminence 
      
      
     H. The damage to Snezana’s necklaces, which were still around her neck 
      
      
     I. The distribution of Snezana’s blood on the floor, wall and furniture, being inconsistent with the position in which her body was found 
      
      
     J. The absence of blood from the children on the cuffs of Snezana’s nightdress 
      
      
     K. The small amount of blood on the knife, even though Snezana’s hands were heavily blood stained 
      
      
     L. The raised position of Zaklina’s left leg, which was not supported by Snezana’s body and which should be attributed to rigor mortis and which indicated that Zaklina’s body had been moved, after rigor mortis had developed, some hours after her death. 
      
    163   Dr Bradhurst’s “scenario” of how Snezana could have got her own blood on the back of her clothing was put to Dr Collins and Dr Collins said that “the entire scenario appears highly improbable to me”. 
    164   Dr Oettle 
     
      
     Dr Oettle “thought it was homicidal, I didn’t think it was suicidal”. In his evidence Dr Oettle set out the factors he relied on and then recapitulated them. Among the factors were:- 
      
      
     (i) A lack of evidence of any spray of blood from Snezana over the bodies of the children (even though, if Snezana had committed suicide, she must have committed suicide after she had killed the children and their bodies were lying on the floor and her body was found lying on top of the bodies of the children). 
      
      
     (ii) Snezana’s clothes showed signs that her body had been moved after she was dead - her nightdress was displaced at the front. 
      
      
     (iii) Snezana’s left leg had blood smears, which were consistent with having been caused by a hand. 
      
      
     (iv) There was damage to Snezana’s necklaces. 
      
      
     (v) Snezana’s hair clip was displaced backwards (which was consistent with someone having taken hold of her by the hair). 
      
      
     (vi) The bruising on the lips and face. 
      
      
     (vii) The abrasion to the left-side of the forehead. 
      
      
     (viii) Bruising to the right parietal region. 
      
      
     (ix) The abrasion at the front of the neck  
      
      
     (x) The petechial haemorrhages. 
      
      
     I would not give weight to reasons (vi) and (viii), which depend on Dr Oettle’s interpretation of photographs and which are not supported by Dr Bradhurst.  
      
    165   Dr Oettle added as a further factor the blood smears around the buttocks of Snezana’s nightdress, which appeared to have been made by an object such as a knife and which were most unlikely to have been made by Snezana. Having regard to the amount of blood on Snezana’s hands, it was remarkable how little blood there was on the handle of the knife. 
    166   Dr Oettle stated a number of opinions he had formed, including the following. The thesis that Snezana had cut the throats of her children and then cut her own throat and had then fallen on the stacked bodies of her children, was contradicted by the presence of her own blood and her children’s blood on the back of Snezana’s clothes and the absence, apart from at one site only, of the children’s blood on the front of Snezana’s clothes. 
    167   The distribution of blood spray on the bed, wall, heater and carpet was consistent with Snezana having been lying face down on the bed, with her head and shoulders over the side of the bed and near the floor, and with her head extended by her hair being pulled from behind, when her throat was cut. 
    168   The position of Zaklina’s left leg (and the position of blood on Zaklina and Zaklina’s clothing) showed that rigor mortis had occurred when Zaklina was lying in a different position from that in which she was found. 
    169   Snezana’s neck injury stretching from some distance below the left ear almost up to the level of the right ear and being deeper on the right hand side than on the left hand side differed from the typical neck injury self-inflicted by a right handed person, where the injury starts high on the left hand side of the neck, becomes deep and then becomes more shallow and ends more distal, that is further away from the top of the head. 
    170   Dr Oettle replied “yes” to the following question from the trial judge:- 
     
      
       
       “In other words, are you saying that, having lost that amount of blood, at the spot shown in the photographs near the cabinet, irrespective of whether she had at that stage received the cut that cut into the spinal column, because of the loss of blood she would not have been able to move to the spot where she was found?” 
       
      
    171   As to Dr Bradhurst’s explanation of how Snezana might have cut the children’s throats, so as to get their blood down the back of her clothes and not the front, Dr Oettle said:- 
     
      
       
       “I think it would be very difficult… because you are only supporting a child with one hand. You have got the knife against your own throat because of the proximity of the two and you would be cutting against the strength of your hand and were you able to do such a cut, immediately that happened the child’s head would have flipped backwards because it went through the cervical spine and there would have been a spray straight over her face and over the side of her. 
       
      
    172   Professor Mason 
     
      
     Professor Mason concluded that on the balance of probabilities the cutting of Snezana’s throat was homicidal. 
      
    173   Professor Mason relied particularly on:- 
     
      
     (i) The general similarity of the wounds on all four victims. 
      
      
     (ii) The “great ferocity” of Snezana’s wounds. 
      
      
     (iii) The superficial cuts, which might otherwise have suggested suicide, mostly went into the deeper wounds, rather than being independent injuries, and “we therefore don’t know whether they are all superficial or, in actual fact, deepening as they go into the wound”. 
      
    174   Professor Mason stated further opinions which he had formed. The distribution of the blood splatter on the walls and furniture showed that “Snezana with near certainty (was) on the floor where the bed now stands and in front of the locker when her throat was cut”. Accordingly “both she and the bed must have been moved later”. “The bed must have been replaced (moved) after her throat was cut and this necessitates the presence of another party”. 
    175   Zaklina’s raised leg was due to persistent rigor mortis and showed that her body had been moved several hours after her death.  
    176   The cut to Snezana’s thenar eminence could be a defence wound. 
    177   The petechial haemorrhages were not due to lividity; the rupture of small blood vessels can occur, only if there is blood pressure and hence the haemorrhages had occurred before Snezana died. 
    178   The presence of blood on Snezana’s face, as shown in photographs, was consistent with her at some stage having lain face down in blood. 
    179   If a child’s neck was cut so as to sever her spinal cord, while Snezana was holding the child, one would have expected the child’s head to fall backwards over its own back (and not forwards over Snezana’s back). 
    180   Dr Zillman 
     
      
     Dr Zillman had very little experience as a pathologist compared with the other expert witnesses and it is clear from many parts of the transcript that he did not fare well in cross-examination. 
      
    181   The mere fact that in the present case there was conflicting expert evidence did not mean that any verdict of guilty would be unsafe. “It is the function of the jury to consider which of two bodies of conflicting evidence, technical or otherwise, they will accept” (Chamberlain v The Queen (1983-84) 153 CLR 521 at 558 per Gibbs CJ and Mason J). Criticism has been made of the conduct of the trial by the Crown, in that no evidence was called by the Crown from some other pathologists, who Dr Bradhurst said concurred in his opinion. However, the concurrence of these other pathologists may have been formed as casually, as Dr Oettle said his initial concurrence with Dr Bradhurst’s opinion had been formed. 
    182   There was circumstantial evidence rendering it improbable that Snezana had killed the children or herself. 
     
      
     (1) Dr Wilcox, a psychiatrist called by the defence, agreed that some of Snezana’s conduct on the Sunday morning, as proved by the appellant’s own evidence, “doesn’t sound” indicative of a person having any problems with her children or her husband. 
      
      
     (2) Dr Walton, Snezana’s obstetrician, gave evidence that on 29 April 1994, when Snezana came to see him for a post-natal visit, she was “very chirpy” and pleased about having carried the twins for thirty-six weeks before delivery. 
      
      
     (3) According to Petre Velevski’s evidence, at about 8.30 on the evening of Sunday 19 June Snezana was preparing a meal for the babies and was preparing a meal for Zaklina for school the following day.  
      
      
     The evidence, such as it was, that Snezana, as distinct from other members of the family, had psychiatric problems was very thin. 
      
    183   In my opinion, applying the tests stated in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 the verdicts of guilty should not be set aside on the grounds that they are unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence or that there has been a miscarriage of justice.

     REGINA v Ljube VELEVSKI 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    184   KIRBY J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Grove J. I agree with the orders proposed in respect of Grounds 1 to 5. I have, however, come to a different view in respect of Ground 6. Ground 6 asserts that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
     
      
     The Test to be Applied 
      
    185   The phrase “unsafe and unsatisfactory” is, of course, a reference to section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). That section provides that the Court of Criminal Appeal must allow an appeal against conviction if the Court is: 
     
      
       
       “of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice” 
       
      
      
     provided that the Court may dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
      
    186   The test is whether the Court believes that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was “open to the jury” to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty (Gipp v The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 1012, per McHugh and Hayne JJ at 1021). Gaudron J, in the same case, said this: (at 1016) 
     
      
       
       “The expression ‘unsafe and unsatisfactory’ has no very precise meaning. It is commonly used to indicate that, although there was evidence to sustain a verdict of guilty, the jury ought, nonetheless, have entertained a reasonable doubt as to guilt.” (references omitted) 
       
      
    187   Most recently, in Fleming v The Queen ((1998) 158 ALR 379), the Court drew attention to the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Kurtic (1996) 85 A Crim R 57, where his Honour said this: (at 60) 
     
      
       
       “In such a case, it is the duty of this Court - whether the appeal is from a jury trial or a judge alone trial - to make its own independent assessment of both the sufficiency and the quality of the evidence, in order to see whether the jury (or judge trying the case alone)  
       ought 
        to have a reasonable doubt or whether this Court itself experiences such a doubt or is persuaded that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted.” 
       
      
      
     Matters Favourable to the Appellant 
      
    188   Here, there were a number of matters which pointed to the innocence of Mr Velevski. These were: 
    · First, the absence of motive. 
    · Second, the absence of forensic evidence connecting the appellant with the crime, in circumstances where you would have expected such evidence. 
    · Third, the police interviews. 
    · Fourth, certain remarks by Mr Velevski immediately after the deaths. 
    · Fifth, the intelligence gathered through listening devices, and telephone interceptions. 
    · Sixth, evidence which may suggest Snezana was psychiatrically disturbed. 
    189   I will deal with each matter in turn. 
     
      
     The Absence of Motive 
      
    190   First, the evidence was that Mr Velevski was a loving father. He had no history of violence. The police, naturally, searched for a motive. None was uncovered. Det Sgt Whyte gave the following evidence: (T 1142/3) 
     
      
       
       “Q. That you went to lots of people and asked questions about whether Mr Velevski had ever demonstrated that he was a violent person? 
        
       A. We certainly went to lots of people and we certainly took lots of statements. That would have been an issue that was looked at, yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And you took many statements from many people attempting to determine the nature of the relationship between this man and his wife and those three little girls? 
        
       A. Yes, that’s right. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And every time you approached someone what you were told that Mr Velevski was both a good husband and a good father? 
        
       A. I can’t think of any, any statements that were otherwise than that, no.” 
       
      
      
     Motive is, of course, not essential ( 
     Plomp v The Queen 
      (1963/64) 110 CLR 234). Its absence, nonetheless, should give one pause. 
      
      
     The Absence of Forensic Evidence 
      
    191   Secondly, there was no forensic evidence to connect Mr Velevski with the crime. Yet, the circumstances were such that you would have expected such evidence. Four persons had died by having their throats cut. The bedroom, between the cot and the bed, was awash with blood. You would have expected that, if Mr Velevski had carried out the murders, he would have been sprayed with blood. You would have expected, therefore, that he would have trailed blood from the place of assassination to other parts of the room, and beyond. You would have expected blood outside the room, as he cleaned himself and his clothes. 
    192   Yet, there was no such evidence. Mr Raymond, an expert in blood stain patterns, said this: (T 581/582) 
     
      
       
       “A. The first impression of the scene was the level of containment of the bloodstained area and the fact that almost all of the staining was below the height of the bed. It wasn’t spread over very big areas. There was - there were no obvious signs to indicate significant blood smearing on surfaces or blood trails which is generally consistent with a major conflict or where there has been a lot of movement by people who are already bloodstained or people who have contacted the bloodstained surfaces. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. In relation to your examination of what you have described as the white three drawer bedside unit, tell us what you observed there? 
        
       A. There was copious blood staining to the front of the unit predominantly on the bottom drawer and the recessed portion underneath the drawer. The patterns were primarily consistent with a large volume of blood having been projected on to the drawer and the recess below but also on to the carpet area underneath the drawer and on the carpet area in front of it. There was also projected blood down the side of the three drawer unit. Now, projected blood is typically what we get when there is a large volume - we are talking about a number of mls of blood which project, such as you get with an arterial gush or somebody who had blood projected from the mouth if they had a lot of blood in the mouth or projected from the neck area with severe wounding. The blood gave rise to what we call multi directional patterns under the drawer. That means there was enough blood to leave a layer of blood on the carpet the blood that was then being projected forward struck the layer of blood and left a pattern which tells us in fact the blood has struck another layer of blood. The pattern is very typical and very easily identified so it tells you there is a lot of blood there.” 
       
      
    193   Dr Bradhurst, the pathologist who performed the post mortem, said this: (T 365) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Within your experience having regard to the amount of blood, if the wounds had of been inflicted by some other person you would have thought it very unlikely for them not to have some blood on their body? 
        
       A. Yes, I would have expected blood on their body. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And I think you would have expected not only … blood on their body but blood on their clothing? 
        
       A. Yes.” 
       
      
    194   He added: (T 365) 
     
      
       
       “Q. And of course what you observed indicated that, whatever occurred, occurred within the - that confined space without any trail or footprints of blood leaving that confined area? 
        
       A. Yes, that is so. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. There was not the slightest evidence of any trail of blood from the area or any foot prints of blood found? 
        
       A. That is so.” 
       
      
    195   The confined nature of the bloodstains is the more startling, given the nature of the Crown case. If Mr Velevski were the murderer, he had to subdue his wife, and do so without disturbing their six year old daughter, Zaklina, or the twins (lest the commotion draw attention), before later murdering the children. One must further assume (as put to various witnesses by the Crown) that Mr Velevski came upon his wife in darkness whilst she was sleeping. Dr Bradhurst said this: (T 384) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Would it be difficult to perform these killings in this confined area and have the ability to confine the blood to this limited area in the absence of light, pitch black? 
        
       A. Certainly it would be very - it would be difficult.” 
       
      
    196   The Crown case was that Mr Velevski had forced his wife off the bed, and near the floor, between the bed and the cot, and there cut her throat. He later cut the children’s throats with his wife lying on the floor, on her stomach, so that the blood from Zaklina and the twins was deposited on her back. For reasons which are obscure, he cut his wife’s throat a second time, depositing yet more blood, superimposed upon blood from the first cut. 
    197   Having done that, Mr Velevski then rearranged the bodies. The twins were positioned at the bottom of the stack. Zaklina was placed in the middle, and Snezana, his wife, on the top. Dr Zillman, called on behalf of the defence, made the following comment: (T 1295) 
     
      
       
       “A. … The mechanism of the injuries sustained by the four individuals in this case are such that there have been repetitive movements of a sharp instrument across the front of each neck. That implies that after one cut, which would have caused bleeding, a hand holding a sharp instrument has had to go past that bleeding area to repeat the cut. It is not possible to know how many times this occurred but each time it occurred, there is the chance that either arterial blood spurts or oozing blood from jugular veins or coughing blood, if that is the case, would foul either the skin or the apparel of at least the right forearm of the assailant; and this would be, in my opinion, sufficient blood staining for blood to be dripping from those areas. 
       
      
      
       
       Now, if the knife was being held firmly in the grasp, it is possible for blood to get on the blade but not as much as you might think because most of the bleeding occurs after the cut has passed and blood rolls off the blade quickly; and if blood is going to get on a hand, it doesn’t necessarily trickle down into the fingers and on to the handle of the knife. 
       
      
      
       
       So, in my opinion, it would be impossible to carry out these repetitive throat-cutting exercises without getting a large amount of blood on at least the right hand and right forearm and that would be the minimum, the bare minimum. 
       
      
      
       
       If there was spurting of blood while bodies were being rearranged; if blood was oozing out while bodies were being moved; if the person was moving into a pool of blood on the floor and out of it again, one would expect blood staining on those parts of the assailant that contacted the blood stained area. 
       
      
      
       
       So, in my opinion, it is impossible that the assailant who is supposed to have carried (out) four cut-throat killings in this case could possibly have gone away from the scene without significant blood staining, and by that I mean blood staining sufficient to produce dripping of blood and that dripping should have been visible. It will have fallen on carpet or furniture. Blood on hands should have appeared on door knobs, those sorts of things. 
       
      
      
       
       Then it raises the problem that this blood has to be removed and the removal of blood leaves evidence itself and my understanding of this case is that there has been no evidence that blood has been removed from anywhere.” 
       
      
    198   Dr Zillman added: (T 1295/6) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Would the blood that gets on the attacker during the course of the killing be increased by lifting the bodies and moving the bodies around? 
        
       A. Yes. Movement of the bodies would facilitate draining of the blood from the open jugular veins, for example. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And would you expect blood to get on to the nether regions, the legs, the trousers, the shoes? 
        
       A. Yes, I would expect that. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And to be walked around the house? 
        
       A. I would expect that. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Into carpet? 
        
       A. Yes.” 
       
      
    199   Det Sgt Whyte, who was in charge of the investigation, described aspects of that investigation. There was, as you would expect, a close examination of Mr Velevski’s clothing, including the clothing he was wearing on the day (T 142). There were no traces of blood. Carpet, furniture, even the drainage system, including the V bends in the plumbing, were removed for inspection. No blood was found (T 143/155). The police returned to the premises with a polylight. A polylight is a high intensity light using ultraviolet and infrared rays to detect minute traces of blood, invisible to the naked eye. Det Sgt Doherty, attached to the Forensic Services Group, described the result: (T 162) 
     
      
       
       “Q. As a result of you using this particular piece of equipment you looked over all the areas and are unable to locate other stainings other than what you have already given evidence about seeing in the main bedroom area? 
        
       A. That is correct. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Also whilst at the premises you carried out an examination of the light switches in the main bedroom? 
        
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. That also includes some light switches located on the bed head? 
        
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And in relation to your examination of those light switches you were unable to find any traces of blood? 
        
       A. That is correct.” 
       
      
    200   The steering wheel from Mr Velevski’s car was removed, and tested. There were no traces of blood. 
     
      
     The Police Interrogation 
      
    201   Thirdly, the police sought from Mr Velevski a blood sample, and a hair sample. He provided both. He was then interrogated upon the following occasions: 
     
      
       
       21 June 1994 12.47 am - 3.06 am 2 hrs 19 mins 
       
      
      
       
       5 July 1994 2.54 pm - 10.15 pm 7 hrs 21mins 
       
      
      
       
       6 July 1994 4.42 pm - 10.43 pm 6 hrs 1 min 
       
      
      
       
       18 July 1994 5.21 pm - 10.32 pm 5 hrs 11 mins 
       
      
      
       
       20 July 1994 4.05 pm - 7.30 pm 3 hrs 25 mins 
       
      
      
       
       6 January 1995 16 mins 
       
      
    202   The account he gave throughout was consistent. One line from that interrogation was judged capable by the trial Judge of amounting to a lie, signifying a consciousness of guilt (that being the suggestion by Mr Velevski that he spent 17 hours in his daughter’s bedroom between 1.00 pm on 19 June 1994 and 6.00 am on 20 June 1994). Mr Velevski did not consult a solicitor throughout this process (T 1212). 
     
      
     Remarks to a Neighbour 
      
    203   Fourthly, on the day itself (20 June 1994), after the bodies had been discovered, Mr Velevski spoke to a neighbour. His neighbour remembered the conversation as having included the following: (T 850) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Did he say something else? 
        
       A. He say like he didn’t believe Snezana do that to the kids because she very deep cut.” 
       
      
    204   This is an odd remark, if one assumes that Mr Velevski had carefully managed the scene to make it appear that his wife had murdered the children, and then committed suicide. The police interviewed the appellant the next day (21 June 1994). The interview included the following: 
     
      
       
       “Q301. Well, well, your wife and your children, they’ve had - they’ve been - they died as a result of knife wounds to their throats. Can you think of anybody that would want to inflict those injuries on your wife and children? 
       
      
      
       
       A. (SUSPECT) I dunno because … 
       
      
      
       
       A. (INTPRTR) Even yesterday I never thought that my wife would do something like that to my children, we both loved our children.” 
       
      
      
     Listening Devices and Telephone Interceptions 
      
    205   Fifthly, listening devices were installed in the premises, and in Mr Velevski’s car, during a period of three weeks, after Mr Velevski had returned to the premises with his parents. Nothing incriminatory was said. This is an aspect dealt with by Grove J (para 68). It enables one to refine the Crown’s hypothesis. Nothing was said between father and son which suggested that Mr Velevski senior knew, or suspected, that his son had done anything wrong. Nothing was said which corroborated the suggestion made by the Crown that the appellant had tutored his father in what to say to the police. Nothing emerged which was inconsistent with the posture of innocence and ignorance which Mr Velevski has maintained throughout. 
     
      
     Was Snezana Psychiatrically Disturbed? 
      
    206   Finally, there are, in my view, some indications that Snezana may have been psychiatrically disturbed. There is, at least, that possibility. There was some evidence, although limited, that Snezana’s mother (Mrs Josifovska) had, at some point, received psychiatric treatment (T 1175, lines 20-22), and was on anti-depressant medication (T 731; T 1436). Snezana’s brother, Mendo, when 23 years old in September 1990, had some form of breakdown. He saw his local doctor, Dr Rao. He was about to undergo a job interview (T 847). Dr Rao arranged for his admission to the Wollongong Hospital, Acute Care Unit. He was discharged on 30 October 1990. 
    207   The appellant made reference to this episode, and to information provided by his wife, when interviewed by the police. Det Cassar said this: (T 1189) 
     
      
       
       “Q. What I am suggesting to you Mr Cassar is that on 22 June 1994, two days after the finding of Mrs Velevski and the bodies of the children, you were told by Mr Velevski that Mendo, the brother, had had a breakdown, had been taken to hospital in Wollongong, that he had a gun, and that his mother had found some bullets under his pillow. That is what he told you on 22 June is it not; paragraph 8? 
        
       A. Yes that’s correct.” 
       
      
    208   Dr Wilcox, psychiatrist, gave evidence, having inspected the hospital notes relating to Mendo’s admission (T 1428). He said this: (T 1428) 
     
      
       
       “HIS HONOUR: Q. What you found possibly relevant to Mrs Velevski’s condition. 
       
      
      
       
       A. Right. What I found was that her brother was admitted at the age of 23 in 1990 to the Wollongong Hospital, the acute care unit, for the management of depression and while he was there he was reported to have purchased bullets and to have expressed suicide ideation. It was commented in the notes that the atmosphere between he and his parents was said to be claustrophobic and the parents were very involved. 
       
      
      
       
       He reported that his parents had been strict on both he and his sister and he was described by Dr O’Brien as a socially isolated man with marked obsessional traits and fears of failure. There was mention that his mother had seen a hypnotherapist and psychiatrist due to anxiety and depression related to her daughter needing an operation on her ear.” 
       
      
    209   The medical evidence relating to Snazana was spare. She had difficult pregnancies with both Zaklina and the twins. She suffered from acute vomiting, requiring admissions to hospital during the course of each pregnancy. She was under the care of Dr Walton, gynaecologist. A social worker, who saw Snezana while she was pregnant with Zaklina, wrote a report suggesting she was not communicating, and that there were difficulties establishing rapport (T 819). She suggested a psychiatric consultation, which was then undertaken by Dr Peter O’Brien, the psychiatric registrar. Dr Walton interpreted the hospital notes. He described Dr O’Brien as having been “reasonably happy although he said he would have wanted to see her later” (T 820). Dr Walton added that, for his part, he had no difficulty communicating with Snezana. 
    210   After the birth of the twins on 3 March 1994, Dr Walton saw Snezana on 29 April 1994 (approximately 7 weeks before her death on 20 June 1994). At that time he saw no signs of post natal depression. He said this: (T 815) 
     
      
       
       ”No, almost exactly the opposite. This girl was very jovial and chirpy, she was essentially skiting about how she was managing and how things had gone well during the pregnancy and after.” 
       
      
    211   Dr Rao, the family doctor, saw Snezana on 6 May 1994. He spent twenty to thirty minutes with her. She appeared extremely happy (T 840). 
    212   However, it would be a mistake to infer, upon the basis of these two consultations, that there was nothing wrong with Snezana at the time of her death. Dr Walton (gynaecologist), and Dr Wilcox (psychiatrist), each acknowledged that the onset of post-natal depression may be delayed. Dr Wilcox said this: (T 1434) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Dr Walton expressed the view that although he observed no signs himself of post-natal depression, he did say that post-natal depression can arise three or four months after the birth of children. Would you agree with that view? 
        
       A. Yes, it can occur at varying times and can occur out of the blue too.” 
       
      
    213   On any view, there was significant domestic turmoil immediately before Snezana died. In the nature of things, those who were in a position to observe Snezana were her husband (the appellant), and his parents. 
    214   The workload upon Snezana had obviously increased after the birth of the twins. The appellant gave evidence that Snezana found it difficult to look after his parents, the house, and the twins as well (T 1211). Snezana plainly had high standards in house cleaning. The house was, as Grove J remarks, clean to the point that it resembled a showroom. 
    215   The appellant asserted that, after the birth of the twins, Snezana would lock herself in the bedroom with increasing frequency (T 1211). She made statements which, in hindsight, are capable of being construed as hints that she may suicide. According to the appellant, she said the following: (T 1211) 
     
      
       
       “A. There would be a change in her facial features and she would get very flushed, very red, and she would get irritable immediately, flare up, and she would lose control of her speech - in her speech and then she would start shouting and saying, ‘I don’t like any of you. I can’t go to my parents any more. Wherever I go, I will go’ - ‘I will take the children with me’ and that ‘I will not be looking for a father there where I am going to go, a father for the children there where I am going to go.’” 
       
      
    216   Snezana said these words on Sunday 19 June 1994. The appellant, later in his evidence, elaborated. He said this: (T 1221) 
     
      
       
       “A. First of all she said that she was going to leave home, that she didn’t care, she didn’t care at all who was going to stay and remain living in the house, and then on our question of ‘Where are you going to go?’ she said, ‘It’s not important where I am going to go’, and she then used the words, ‘I am not going to go to my mother and father any more, I’m not looking for a husband or father for my children, wherever I will go I will go and I will take the children with me.’” 
       
      
    217   The conversation between the appellant and Snezana continued: (T 1222) 
     
      
       
       “A. I said, ‘Why do you want to leave home?’ 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And what did she say? 
        
       A. She said, ‘It is not important for you to know.’ I asked her, ‘Where are you going to go?’ She said, ‘I am going to live in a flat, in some flat’ - and she didn’t say which one or where, she just said, ‘in a flat’.” 
       
      
    218   The appellant’s account continued as follows: (T 1222) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Well then did she go somewhere? 
        
       A. For some time she sat in the television room, about ten to fifteen minutes, and she was crying by herself. We weren’t bothering her during that time, not upsetting her. She was just crying. About 5 to 11 or 11 o’clock as she was going from the television room into the room where the twins were you could see her stomping with her feet, going stomping, very upset, a very upset condition, and then as she was going to go into the room she slammed the door forcefully. The whole house shook from that.” 
       
      
    219   If this evidence were fabricated, designed to suggest that Snezana was contemplating suicide, you would not have expected the appellant to have included the reference by Snezana to moving to a flat. 
    220   Mr Petre Velevski, the appellant’s father, gave evidence along similar lines. On Saturday 18 June 1994, according to Mr Velevski Snr, the following occurred: (T 955) 
     
      
       
       “A. We were sitting on the verandah outside. She came and I could tell that she was not - she was not herself. Words she was saying were strange. And she said to me that I am not going to live in this house and I said ‘Why don’t you want to live in this house, it is a new house, everything has been well arranged’, and she said to me that ‘Wherever I go I will take the children with me.’” 
       
      
    221   Mr Velevski endeavoured to engage Snezana in conversation. She ignored his questions. The night before her death he thought she was not well. She appeared confused (T 753). 
    222   Dr Wilcox, psychiatrist, expressed the following opinion: (T 1432) 
     
      
       
       “… It is my impression that like her brother she may have had obsessional traits in her personality as evidenced by how she kept her home in an immaculate condition and she was not satisfied until she had personally checked all the locks in the house. She may have also had high expectations of herself and this could have made it more difficult for her to accept that she was not coping. She did not like her family members to see her when she was upset and regularly withdrew to her bedroom until she felt in control again.” 
       
      
    223   Dr Wilcox thought that Snezana may have developed a depressive illness. He said this: (T 1433) 
     
      
       
       “She was certainly under more stress having to care for twins and elderly relatives and this level of stress in someone with a vulnerability to develop depression, being related to a family history, may have led to her becoming depressed. If she had developed depression she may have perceived that her situation was hopeless and could have possibly had feelings of guilt and may have experienced difficulty in seeing a future for herself.” 
       
      
    224   Dealing with the day before her death, Dr Wilcox gave the following evidence: (T 1433) 
     
      
       
       “After Mrs Velevski spoke to her mother on the day prior to her death she was very upset and her speech was reported as not making sense. She sounded confused as if she had lost contact with reality. If this was the situation she may have been becoming psychotic as confusion, perplexity and lability of mood are recognised as symptoms of a psychosis that occurs in the post partum period.” 
       
      
    225   There is evidence, however, which may suggest a different inference. The appellant’s description of his wife the day before her death (the Sunday), included the following: (T 1447) 
     
      
       
       “… Snezana was on the bed and the twins were on the bed with her, that she put her hand over to his neck and pulled him down on to the bed … She said to him, ‘Come over and let’s lay in together for a little bit’ and he cautioned her to be careful because he didn’t want to squash the babies and then the accused said, ‘And then I went into the bed with her and just to keep her happy to lay with her and the babies and she said ‘Look how they are smiling towards us, I think they are starting to recognise us’.’” 
       
      
    226   Snezana prepared milk bottles for the twins in the late afternoon or early evening. She also packed Zaklina’s school bag, ready for the next day. Further, as mentioned, in her conversation with the appellant, she spoke of moving into a flat. 
    227   Such matters may either suggest an incomplete resolve to take her own life (and that of her children) at the time she spoke, or erratic behaviour. There remains for me the impression that Snezana, genetically, may have been predisposed towards depression, and that shortly before her death she may have been seriously disturbed. 
     
      
     The Circumstantial Case 
      
    228   I will later deal with the medical evidence. It was common ground that the medical evidence alone was not enough to convict the appellant. His Honour so instructed the jury (SU 8, 127, 207). 
    229   Each pathologist, even those who believed Snezana had been murdered, acknowledged the possibility that she may have committed suicide. The Crown, therefore, identified a number of circumstances which were said to be incriminating. When added to the medical evidence, they were enough, so it was said, to exclude any reasonable hypothesis other than guilt. The circumstances can be grouped as follows: 
    · First, the assertion by the appellant (characterised as a lie) that he remained for 17 hours alone in his daughter’s bedroom. 
    · Second, the appellant’s actions the next day did not represent a genuine search for his wife and children. 
    · Third, that Mr Velevski’s failure to penetrate the locked door to the bedroom, either by finding the means to open it, or breaking it down, was consistent with knowledge of what lay beyond the door. 
    230   I will deal with each matter in turn. 
     
      
     The Long Sleep 
      
    231   In the course of the summing up, his Honour said this: (SU 206) 
     
      
       
       “The next matter that the Crown says was a lie that he told, was that he spent from 1pm to 6am in Zaklina’s room and that he slept from about 3 or 4pm until 6am the next morning.” 
       
      
    232   His Honour added: 
     
      
       
       “The Crown submits the reason for this lie, and you will remember I said you have to be satisfied that (a), that it was a lie and (b), that it related to a material matter and the Crown says that the reason for this lie is to give him a type of alibi that he was asleep and therefore he did not do it.” 
       
      
    233   The context is important. In the course of the weekend (T 787/8), Snezana made it plain that she could no longer tolerate the appellant’s parents living at their home (T 114; T 1408). The appellant’s parents had lived with Snezana and the appellant (first at Cringila, and then at 10 Castle Court, Berkeley) since 1989 (apart from a period of three months). Later Snezana, somewhat inconsistently, announced that she was leaving, and taking the children. This was the first time she had made such a threat (T (T (T 1211). The appellant believed that they would not remain together (T 1403). 
    234   It is hardly surprising, in these circumstances, that the appellant should be depressed. He so described himself (T 114/115). He also said he was “very upset and disturbed” (T 1223). 
    235   Further, it is plain from his conversations with the police, and his evidence, that the appellant did not sleep for the entire time he was in Zaklina’s room. Dealing with his statements in chronological order, he first spoke to Snr Const Peter Stefanjuk at approximately 6.00pm on the day of the incident (20 June 1994). Const Stefanjuk was able to speak Yugoslav (T 114). The appellant’s account was as follows: (T 114/115) 
     
      
       
       “I then said ‘Can you tell me what happened?’ He said, ‘There was a disagreement between Sneza and her mother when Sneza asked her mother for help in looking after the children. I went into the daughter’s bedroom at 1 o’clock and didn’t come out until 6 this morning.’ 
       
      
      
       
       I said ‘Did you sleep the entire time?’ He said, ‘I slept a little. I just laid there for periods because I was depressed.’ I said ‘Did anything else happen that day?’ He said ‘Sneza told me that my parents had to move out of the house.’ I said ‘When did you last see your wife?’ He said, ‘I last saw her at 1 o’clock yesterday.’” 
       
      
    236   When first interviewed on video, with the aid of an interpreter, Mr Velevski made the following statement: 
     
      
       
       “Q229. All right. After you went to bed you say 1 o’clock on Sunday afternoon did you get up at all? 
        
       A. (SUSPECT) No, doesn’t get up till 6 o’clock … 
       
      
      
       
       Q230. Are you saying you slept from 1 pm to 6 am? 
        
       A. (SUSPECT) 1 pm to 6 am, yeah.” 
       
      
    237   The appellant spoke to a neighbour, Mr Jorge, at 3.00 pm on Monday June 20 1994. It was Mr Jorge who summoned the police. Mr Jorge provided a statement to the police. It was his recollection that the appellant had told him that he had last seen his wife at 2.00 am. That statement was put to the appellant during the course of the interview. The exchange is instructive. It illustrates the appellant’s difficulties with language. The ERISP transcript is as follows: 
     
      
       
       “Q248. Did you tell Tony that at 2 am you went into Zaklina’s room where you slept? 
        
       A. (SUSPECT) Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       A. (INTPRTR) Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q249. Do you agree that a very short time ago you told me you slept from 1 pm to 6 am? 
        
       A.(INTPRTR) From 1 o’clock from Sunday … 
       
      
      
       
       A.(SUSPECT) Yeah, Sunday, yeah. 
       
      
      
       
       A.(INTPRTR) … I wasn’t really sleeping though, I just lay down. 
       
      
      
       
       A.(SUSPECT) No, like a little bit to slow down and slept night and - I don’t know, whole time he - he start, you know, like sleep, you know, he doesn’t know, you know, he doesn’t know … 
       
      
      
       
       A.(INTPRTR) I really - like I was dozing off and I really really didn’t know what time I’ve fallen asleep. 
       
      
      
       
       Q250. Well, at any time did you get up and leave your your daughter’s bedroom? 
        
       A.(INTPRTR) No. No, not - not even in the toilet. 
       
      
      
       
       Q251. Is it correct to say that you were in your daughter’s bedroom from 1 pm Sunday to 6 am Monday? 
        
       A.(SUSPECT) Yeah, 6.00, Monday, yeah.” 
       
      
    238   In a later interview (5 July 1994, Q 355) the appellant likened his sleep to “the dead” (Vol 7, p 1941). When he went to sleep in Zaklina’s bedroom the door was open (Vol 8, p 2069, Q 184; T 1182). When he woke up it had been locked. 
    239   In a later interview (20 July 1994), the appellant made the following statement, in answer to a question from the police which was not entirely fair: (Vol 8, p 2097) 
     
      
       
       “Q111. Can you give me any reason why have slept so long, for 17 hours? 
        
       A.(INTPRTR) I don’t know. I can’t - I can’t imagine how - why I slept so long ‘cause this has never happened to me before in my life.”  
       
      
    240   Det Snr Const Cassar accompanied Mr Velevski to the morgue on 22 June 1994 to identify the twins. Det Cassar gave the following evidence of his conversation with the appellant: (T 1182) 
     
      
       
       “Q. And in the presence of hearing Detective Little and Mr Klimovski, did the accused say: ‘Will I be tested for taking sleeping tablets’? 
        
       A. That’s correct. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And you said: ‘I don’t think so, it’s much too late to detect anything. What makes you ask?’? 
        
       A. Yes I did. I said that. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Can you give what his answer was? 
        
       A. He said to me: ‘I can’t understand why I slept so long. I’ve worked triplers and haven’t slept for that long. I can’t understand why I didn’t hear anything.’ I said: ;What time did you go to sleep?’ He said: ‘At 1 o’clock.’” 
       
      
    241   When the police interviewed Mr Velevski on 18 July 1994, his conversation with Det Cassar was put to him. He acknowledged the accuracy of Det Cassar’s note. When asked why he wanted to know whether he would be tested for sleeping tablets, he responded with these words: (Vol 8, p 2069) 
     
      
       
       “Because I never - I have never slept for that long what I did on that day, for 17 hours.” 
       
      
    242   A number of statements contradicted the appellant’s assertion that he had been isolated for such a prolonged period. Some are referred to by Grove J (p 38, para 99/100). First, the appellant spoke to Tode Glavevska (a cousin of Snezana) on 27 June 1994, one week after the bodies had been discovered (T 802). The conversation was overheard by his wife, Snezana Glavevska. The account given by Mrs Glavevska was in these terms: (T 804) 
     
      
       
       “He said that at about 5 o’clock that afternoon she had come out to warm up some milk for the children. He didn’t see her after that. She went back into the room. And then he had gone to sleep in Zaklina’s room and had fallen asleep heavily.” 
       
      
    243   Secondly, the appellant’s father, Petre Velevski, when interviewed by the police on 20 June 1994 (the day the bodies were discovered) stated that he, his wife, Zaklina and the appellant had eaten together on the Sunday night. He later changed that evidence. His original evidence, and the change, emerges from the following passage, taken from his evidence: (T 933) 
     
      
       
       “Q. I suggest to you that in the statement that you gave to the police on 20 June 1994 you said these words, ‘I had dinner with my wife, Ljubo and my grand-daughter Zaklina. Snezana was at the time with the twins in the lounge room’? 
        
       A. No, I only had dinner with Zaklina and with my wife Tasa. Ljube was sleeping in the bedroom and Tasa was in the bedroom. Snezana was in the room with the twins and Ljube was in Zaklina’s room.” 
       
      
    244   Mr Petre Velevski, having made a written statement on 20 June 1994, was later interviewed on video (4 July 1994). An interpreter read his statement. Mr Petre Velevski acknowledged its accuracy. When giving evidence, he explained his mistake upon the following basis: (T 934) 
     
      
       
       “Yes, I saw him. I saw the tape and I - I saw the tape yesterday and I saw myself saying that I am tired, I am exhausted, I don’t understand what you are reading. We were grieving, we were very sad.” 
       
      
    245   Thirdly, Mr Velevski’s neighbour, Mr Jorge, in the passage already referred to, recalled a conversation with Mr Velevski before the police were summoned. Mr Velevski said that he had last seen his wife at 2.00 am (T 886). The door had been locked since 2.00 am (T 886). He acknowledged that Mr Velevski’s English was poor (T 885). One may be inclined, upon the basis of language difficulties, to dismiss that account, were it not for the fact that it coincides with the evidence of Snr Const Gray, who was one of the first police to arrive at the premises. Const Gray assisted in breaking down the bedroom door. Immediately before it was broken down, she had the following conversation with the appellant: (T 61) 
     
      
       
       “He returned to the living room a short time later with a hammer. I said to him, ‘What time did you last see your wife and kids?’ He said, ‘I go to bed at 2 this morning’. Velevski then handed me the hammer.” 
       
      
    246   The Crown referred to Mr Velevski’s assertion that he had been in Zaklina’s bedroom from 1.00 pm to 6.00 am as a “type of alibi”, as his Honour reminded the jury when summing up (S-U, T 206). Grove J likewise characterised the unbroken stay of the appellant in Zaklina’s bedroom as providing “the appellant with an established alibi” (p 37, para 98). An alibi, however, is the assertion (usually supported by witnesses) of an absence of opportunity, because the accused is geographically removed from the scene of the crime. 
    247   The appellant’s account cannot, in my view, be regarded as an alibi, as that term is usually understood. The essence of an alibi is the absence of opportunity. Here the appellant was in an adjacent bedroom. He was present, moreover, when others in the household (namely his parents) were asleep. His account can hardly be said to be an alibi. It was simply a denial of involvement, with an explanation as to where he was. 
    248   One can readily infer that a statement asserting a false alibi is made with a consciousness of guilt. However, where the statement which is said to be false is not an alibi at all, but a detail of the accused’s denial, then the inference may or may not arise, depending upon the nature of the falsehood. 
    249   Was the statement by the appellant a lie? A number of matters trouble me in respect of the inference that the appellant was deliberately lying. First, there was significant domestic turmoil. Snezana had threatened to leave, taking the children. According to a statement attributed to the appellant by Mrs Glavevski, Snezana had made the threat after two days and two nights of argument, where the appellant had neither eaten nor slept. Whether that be right or wrong (and the appellant did not assert that he had been deprived of sleep), it is not surprising that Mr Velevski should retreat, and seek escape in sleep. 
    250   Secondly, the foundation for the lie, namely that he slept 17 hours, is insubstantial. Although the appellant, at times, acknowledged that he slept from 1.00 pm to 6.00 am, a fair reading of his answers, making allowance for difficulties in language, makes it clear that he did not sleep for the entire period. For part of the time he lay there thinking. He ultimately fixed the time at which he went to sleep as perhaps 4.00 pm. Fourteen hours is still an extraordinary sleep. Many of his answers, nonetheless, are consistent with something less than that (“I just laid there for periods because I was depressed”, “I wasn’t really sleeping”). 
    251   Thirdly, the appellant himself volunteered to the police the matters which made his sleep the more extraordinary. He usually had seven hours sleep a night (T 1246). Even when he had done a triple shift, he never slept for so long (T 1246). He slept normally the night before (T 1237/8). He could offer no explanation as to why he should have slept for so long (T 1247). It seems odd that someone who had taken such trouble, and exercised such skill, to make a murder appear as though it were suicide, should make such disclosures. 
    252   Fourthly, the appellant, in his answers to the police, gives the impression of being genuinely puzzled by what had occurred. His question to Det Cassar as to whether he would be tested for sleeping tablets is consistent with that impression. Unfortunately, this aspect was not explored. One does not know whether there were sleeping tablets within the household. His question to Det Cassar suggests that there may have been. 
    253   The statements attributed to Mr Velevski, which suggest that he left the room, are more troubling. It is clear, however, that Mr Velevski’s difficulties in communicating in English were profound. From time to time in the ERISP interview he broke into English. His responses were unintelligible. An example is provided in the ERISP tape of 5 July 1994, answer 856 (Vol 8, p 2014). Given that difficulty, and given the subtlety of the concept of am and pm, some doubt much attach to the impression he apparently gave his neighbour and the police constable, that he had last seen Snezana at 2.00 am. In respect of the change to his father’s evidence, Petre Velevski may or may not have been confused. There are certainly examples of confusion in the father’s evidence, such as the following: (T 939/40) 
     
      
       
       “Q. I am suggesting to you this: When you gave the statement to the police you told them that ‘Later on the Sunday evening Ljube and Sneza had a little argument about what dress Sneza was going to wear to a wedding.? 
        
       A. That was for Saturday or … 
       
      
      
       
       Q. I am suggesting that you told the police that on the Sunday night? 
        
       A. No Sunday night was said. That was all happening on Saturday. They said this on Saturday, not on Sunday. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. The police were not asking what occurred on the Saturday, were they? 
        
       A. He maybe asked me about the Sunday and I answered him about the Saturday. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. So you are saying that your reference to the arguments about Snezana’s dress was on Saturday night, is that what you are saying? 
        
       A. That was on Saturday, that is how I know.” 
       
      
    254   However, assuming the appellant’s statement (concerning the time in Zaklina’s bedroom) was a lie, what significance should it be given? It is important to bear in mind the cautionary words of Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in R v Edwards (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 211: 
     
      
       
       “A lie may be told out of panic, to escape an unjust accusation, to protect some other person or to avoid a consequence extraneous to the offence. The jury should be told that, if they accept that a reason of that kind is the explanation for the lie, they cannot regard it as an admission. It should be recognised that there is a risk that, if the jury are invited to consider a lie told by an accused, they will reason that he lied simply because he is guilty unless they are appropriately instructed with respect to these matters. And in many cases where there appears to be a departure from the truth it may not be possible to say that a deliberate lie has been told. The accused may be confused. He may not recollect something which, upon his memory being jolted in cross-examination, he subsequently does recollect.” 
       
      
    255   If the father’s original version were right, the appellant sat down with his parents and six year old daughter Zaklina, and shared an unremarkable meal before slaughtering his family (including Zaklina) several hours later. 
     
      
     The Removal of the Parents 
      
    256   Early the next morning, Monday 20 June 1994, the appellant transported his aged parents to his sister’s home at Blackbutt, near Shellharbour. This was a matter relied upon by the Crown as part of the circumstantial case against the appellant. In argument the Crown said this: (CCA, T 40) 
     
      
       
       “The third is he told his parents that they should leave the house and pack their belongings and he took them to his sister’s home in Blackbutt. On the evidence there appears to be no adequate reason given for that happening in those particular circumstances - just after he goes at 6 am to the door and finds it locked.” 
       
      
    257   The appellant said that, having awoken at 6.00 am, he tried the bedroom door. It was locked. He knocked, and there was no response (T 1224). His father, Petre Velevski, was nearby. His description of his son’s actions was in similar terms (T 951). The appellant assumed that his wife and children were within the locked room. He thereupon decided that he should take his parents to his sister’s home. His mother was woken up. Their belongings were gathered. He then telephoned his sister (Mrs Najdovska) to apprise her of his plan. According to her evidence, he made that call at approximately 7.30 am. He arrived half an hour later (T 688). The daughter of Mrs Najdovska, Dianna, gave evidence. She was fifteen years old as at 20 June 1994. She said this: (T 439/40) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Just tell us about what happened? 
        
       A. They came with my grandparents, he had brought them over to our house with their stuff, like a few belongings and that, and my grandmother was upset and crying, so was my uncle, and they sat in the loungeroom and spoke with my parents.” 
       
      
    258   She recalled the appellant (her uncle) saying these words: (T 441) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Did you tell the police that the accused said to you ‘Snezana said she doesn’t love me or my parents any more. She told them that she can live without a husband. Can my parents stay here until we find them somewhere to live? If she accepts me back I will live without them.’ Is that what you told the police? 
        
       A. Yes, that’s right.” 
       
      
    259   She also remembered his saying the following words: (T 441) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Do you remember this conversation that he said to you, ‘I haven’t seen her or the girls since 1.30 pm on Sunday. She locked herself in the room and wouldn’t come out. I slept in the other room.’? 
        
       A. Yes.” 
       
      
    260   For my part, I do not believe this episode is incriminatory. Had the appellant removed his parents before his wife and children died, one could understand how suspicion may attach to his actions. The time of death, however, was estimated to be between 9.00 pm (on 19 June 1994) and 5.00 am. By 6.00 am, when these events begin to unfold, the four persons in the bedroom were dead. 
    261   The actions of the appellant, rather, are consistent with innocence. The family was in crisis. His wife intended to leave with the children. His parents were plainly a source of friction. Their removal may conceivably assist in reconciliation. 
     
      
     The Appellant’s Actions Thereafter 
      
    262   The appellant remained at his sister’s home for some time (approximately two hours) (T 441). He then returned to Castle Court to collect the remainder of his parents’ belongings, which he delivered to his sister. 
    263   His actions thereafter are said not to reveal a “realistic pursuit of his wife in order to find out what was the matter” (Grove J, p 40, para 105). First, he went to the Macedonian Welfare Association. He did so at the suggestion of his sister. He arrived at approximately 11.00 am (T 908). He saw Mrs Olga Nikolovski. Mrs Nikolovski said this: (T 908) 
     
      
       
       “… if I go back to the beginning of when I first invited him in the office, the first question he asked me was ‘Has my wife come here for help, has my wife been here?’ I then said ‘What is her name?’ He said ‘Sneza’. I said ‘No she has not’.” 
       
      
    264   Mr Velevski then recounted his problems. Mrs Nikolovski gave the following evidence: (T 908) 
     
      
       
       “I then recall asking him if he checked at school if his little girl was at school because he had previously told me that he has - that they have three daughters, a six year old and baby twin girls and then I asked him if he had checked whether his six year old daughter was at school. He said ‘No’, and then I recall suggesting, ‘Ljube, go and check if your daughter is at school’ - after our conversation, of course. Then I said - because he kept repeating that he doesn’t know where his wife is - I said ‘She may be at her mother’s place.’ I said ‘Have you checked at your … mother-in-law’s place.’ He said ‘No, I haven’t checked. I don’t have their number. They won’t give me their phone number’.” 
       
      
    265   Mrs Nikolovski also said this: (T 910) 
     
      
       
       “During the conversation Ljube frequently would, like, burst into a spasmodic tearless cry and then he would quickly contain himself. And he would repeat that he is afraid for his daughters because he loves them and he loves his wife.” 
       
      
    266   Mrs Nikolovski said that, if he had not heard from his wife by 3.00 pm, he should contact the police. 
    267   The appellant then went to his daughter’s school. He arrived at 11.30 am. He spoke to his daughter’s school teacher, Mrs Dimitrovski. She described what happened in these words: (T 917) 
     
      
       
       “My student at the time was giving a math’s lesson that I was observing. I went up to the door and I said ‘Hello’, I smiled. He didn’t respond by smiling back or anything like that. There was no change in his appearance and then he said, these are the two notes for Zaklina’s absence on Friday and he handed them to me and  
       then he said, ‘Is she here’, and when he said that he actually took a step inside the classroom and I said ‘no’ and he stepped back, and he said, ‘I haven’t seen them since Sunday morning 
       . …’” (emphasis added) 
       
      
    268   She noticed that the appellant was crying. 
    269   At 1.00 pm the appellant telephoned Mrs Zagorka Glavevska, Snezana’s aunt. Mrs Glavevska said this: (T 787) 
     
      
       
       “He told me ‘Snezana has left she is not at home she is with her mother and father.’ And I told him go and check if she is with them, with the parents.” 
       
      
    270   Mrs Glavevska added: (T 787) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Was there anything else said? 
        
       A. Yes and I told him to notify the police and he told me he cannot do that because he has to be at home in case Snezana returns because he was told he has to wait for 24 hours before looking for her and I told him ring Snezana’s parents and to find out if she is there and he told me ‘I don’t have the number of Snezana’s parents.” 
       
      
    271   The conversation continued: (T 788) 
     
      
       
       “…. He was crying whilst telling me - he told me they had an argument for two days and two nights and he hadn’t eat or slept for those periods, for that time. And he told me that they went visiting his sister at Shellharbour and when he came back at home Snezana was gone and he was looking for her and for the family. And he was looking for her - he was crying and he told me that ‘My house is empty, my family’s gone’.” 
       
      
    272   The appellant did not go to his mother-in-law’s home. Instead, he remained within his home at Castle Court, finally approaching neighbours at 3.00 pm. It was the neighbours who summoned the police. 
    273   I do not find the appellant’s attempts to find his wife and children unrealistic. His sister suggested that he should attend the Macedonian Welfare Centre. He did so. It is significant that his first question was: 
     
      
       
       “Has my wife been here?” 
       
      
    274   Mrs Olga Nikolovski suggested that he should go to Zaklina’s school. Had Snezana left, she may have dropped Zaklina at the school (by taxi or through her mother). It was a school day. Doing so would assist Snezana to cope with the twins. Again, it is significant that the appellant stepped into the classroom, searching for Zaklina. Further, Mr Velevski told Mrs Glavevska at about 1.00 pm that “he had better be at home in case she returned” (T 787). 
    275   The Crown pointed to a number of aspects of the appellant’s conduct which were suspicious. First, his suggestion that Mrs Nikolovski told him not to contact the police for 24 hours was untrue. All she said was that he should wait until 3.00 pm before contacting the police. However, Mr Velevski (through neighbours) in fact contacted the police at 3.00 pm. Moreover, on his account, it had been 24 hours, or thereabouts, since he had seen his wife and children. 
    276   Secondly, it was unlikely (so it was said) that Mr Velevski did not know his mother-in-law’s telephone number. He certainly knew her address (since he took Zaklina to his mother-in-law from time to time). He gave no adequate explanation for not having gone to that address. 
    277   I do not find it remarkable that the appellant should not know the telephone number of Snezana’s mother. She did not like him. He did not like her. He believed, moreover, that her interference in their marriage was part of the problem (T 908). One imagines he had as little to do with her as possible. 
    278   It is rather more odd that Mr Velevski did not go to his mother-in-law’s home. However, one can, to some extent, understand his diffidence. If his wife had left him, and returned to her mother, attempting to entice her from that location was likely to worsen the situation rather than improve it. The accused asserted that when he telephoned Snezana’s aunt, Mrs Glavevska, at 1.00 pm, his purpose (or part of his purpose) was to persuade her to telephone his mother-in-law on his behalf. She, however, refused to do so (ERISP, 5/7/94, Q 594 & A). 
     
      
     The Failure to Penetrate the Door 
      
    279   The appellant’s actions upon waking from his sleep have already been described. At 6.00 am he knocked on the bedroom door. There was no response. He attempted to gain access. The door was locked. At this point he assumed that his wife and children were still inside. 
    280   Mr Velevski then took his parents to his sister’s home. He remained there approximately two hours (T 441). He returned to collect his parents’ belongings. Snezana, meanwhile, had not emerged from the bedroom. The house, no doubt, was silent. Mr Velevski gave the following answers in cross examination: (T 1404) 
     
      
       
       “Q. In the interview you had on 5 July 1994 with Det White and Det McGrath, I suggest that you indicated to them in that interview that when you returned on that occasion to collect your parents’ belongings, that you did not attempt to knock again on the door? 
        
       A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Why not? 
        
       A. I don’t know myself why I didn’t. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. At that time when you returned did you believe or think that your wife and children were still inside the bedroom? 
        
       A. I wasn’t sure at that stage. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. The reason why you did not know, Mr Velevski, is that you full well knew that they were inside there and were incapable of answering the door? 
        
       A. No. I don’t know about that. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. When you went back on that occasion did you try to open the door? 
        
       A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Did you go to look under the door? 
        
       A. No.” 
       
      
    281   It is certainly odd that Mr Velevski did not check the door. However, he said this: (T 1404) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Did you think at that time that it was a possibility that she may have not been in the room and been somewhere else? 
        
       A. Yes, that she may have been out of the house.” 
       
      
    282   The appellant’s reaction is less odd if he thought his wife was elsewhere. She had, after all, threatened to leave. He had been gone a number of hours. Although she did not drive, she could have left by taxi, or been picked up by her family. Indeed, later in the day (at 3.00 pm), a house painter, Frank Csapo, working on an adjacent house, was asked the following question by a woman (one infers at the request of the appellant): (T 1072) 
     
      
       
       “Q. And she asked you: Have you seen a car or taxi come around to the house and take his wife and children away? 
        
       A. Yes.” 
       
      
    283   Two criticisms are made of the appellant. First, if he were truly concerned for his wife and children, why did he not batter down the door? Secondly, why did he not at least look under the door? Had he done so, he would have seen his wife’s legs stretched out on the floor (cf Snr Const Haydon T 21). 
    284   In addressing these questions, it is difficult to eradicate hindsight. We now know what lay behind the door. To Mr Velevski, if he were innocent, the annihilation of his family in this manner would have been simply unimaginable. He had a worry of a different kind. His wife wanted nothing to do with him. She was about to leave, and take the children. His task was to woo her back. That was a matter of some delicacy. Battering down the door would be unlikely to further his cause. Snezana was a person who was both fastidious and houseproud. 
    285   Taking account of those matters favourable to the appellant, and examining critically those matters said to be adverse, I believe a jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. Upon this evidence (leaving aside, for the moment, the medical evidence), I believe that there is a significant possibility that Mr Velevski may be innocent. 
    286   I will now turn to the medical evidence which occupied much of the time taken by the trial. 
     
      
     The Gathering of Medical Evidence 
      
    287   Dr Bradhurst is a pathologist attached to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in New South Wales. He assists the New South Wales Coroner. He described his role in these words: (T 238) 
     
      
       
       “For the coroner, we examine people that have died, to find out, or to try and find out, you know, why they died and we then submit a report to the coroner giving our opinion on the cause of death of that person. It involves performing autopsies. It also involves examining the tissues from the body under the microscope.” 
       
      
    288   When a death occurs in circumstances identified by s 12A Coroners Act 1980, a pathologist is notified, and attends the scene. On 20 June 1994, Dr Bradhurst was notified. He arrived at Castle Court, Berkeley, at 7.40 pm. The scene was undisturbed. He examined the bodies in situ. He later prepared a report. When examined by the Crown Prosecutor, Dr Bradhurst was taken to that report. He said this: (T 254) 
     
      
       
       “Q. If I can take you then to page 10 of your report. Just you have made a comment there on the cut throat. Just in relation to the first paragraph of what you have indicated there? 
        
       A. In my opinion the quiet scene findings with no evidence of a struggle, the numerous superficial parallel cuts along the edges of the main deep incised wound and the absence of typical defence type injuries were all considered consistent with this cut throat being self-inflicted rather than with being carried out by someone else.” 
       
      
    289   His examination included the following: (T 268) 
     
      
       
       “Q. In fact, in the last paragraph of that comment on the cause of death? 
        
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You say there: 
        
         
         ‘My opinion is based only on the medical evidence available to me. This opinion is that on this medical evidence the scene and autopsy findings were consistent with Snezana Velevski’s cut throat being self-inflicted rather than being inflicted by the hand of another.’? 
         
        
       
      
      
       
       A. Yes.” 
       
      
    290   The examination continued as follows: (T 268) 
     
      
       
       “Q. If you could read from your report half way down that page where you say, ‘In my opinion’? 
        
       A. ‘In my opinion the cut throat wound had features typical of self-infliction. It was accompanied by a series of parallel superficial tentative cuts, leading to the margin of the main wound. The wound extended higher and penetrated more deeply on one side, that is the right side of the neck, than the other and passed across the front of the neck. It cut through the median cricoid thyroid ligament at the lower margin of the thyroid cartilage, which although not as frequent as an incised wound cutting through the thyroid hyoid ligament, is nevertheless quite consistent with self-infliction. The fact of two deep cuts into the cervical spine with one extending more deeply to damage the chord is again quite consistent with self-infliction.’” 
       
      
    291   Det Sgt Whyte, who was in charge of the investigation, gave the following evidence: (T 1133) 
     
      
       
       “Q. You were aware, having received that report from Dr Bradhurst and read it, you understood that Dr Bradhurst had said; I am not asking you to express a view about the opinion of these doctors but the fact I want from you is that you understood that Dr Bradhurst said that his view was confirmed by some of his professional colleagues. You understood that to be the case? 
        
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. But you did not get at any time, did you a written statement from Professor Hilton, the Director of the Institute? 
        
       A. No, I did not. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Nor did you get a statement from Dr Lawrence at the Institute? 
        
       A. No. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Nor did you get a statement from Dr Duflou at the Institute? 
        
       A. No, I didn’t. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. They being doctors who Dr Bradhurst had said agreed with his view? 
        
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Why did you not get statements from those men? 
        
       A. I had been to two conferences with a number of those doctors. I can’t recall if all doctors were present at both conferences. I am aware of the views they held and I took the view that Dr Bradhurst’s report certainly covered the views held by those doctors. I did not see the point of getting any further reports from them.” 
       
      
    292   Professor Bottrill assisted Dr Bradhurst to carry out the autopsies. No opinion was sought from Professor Bottrill. 
    293   Det Sgt Whyte however, sought the opinion of Dr Cooke. It was appropriate that he should have done so. Dr Cooke was the Chief Forensic Pathologist and head of the Department of Forensic Medicine in Western Australia. He had been invited by the New South Wales State Coroner to travel to Sydney to examine the bodies of the deceased. He did so on 25 June 1994 (T 389). He spent a number of hours with Dr Bradhurst reviewing the findings on post mortem (T 389). 
    294   Dr Cooke prepared a preliminary report on 27 June 1994. He stated that the medical evidence alone was not conclusive (T 389). Dr Cooke explained what he meant in the following passage: (T 390) 
     
      
       
       “A. Yes, I understood the mother’s neck injury was the main focus of interest here and the main questing being whether this was actually homicidally, or suicidally, inflicted. I felt from the purely medical point of view, that it was very difficult to make any definite statement in favour of one way or the other. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You felt it difficult to make a statement, whether the medical findings concerning the neck injury, were consistent with suicide, as opposed to being consistent with homicide? 
        
       A. Yes, I felt it was difficult to make a definite statement either way.” 
       
      
    295   Dr Cooke, nonetheless, identified eight matters of concern in respect of the hypothesis that Snezana may have committed suicide. 
    296   In September 1994, Det Whyte sought an opinion from Dr Oettle (T 515). Dr Oettle was a former Director of the Division of Forensic Medicine at Glebe (T 513). In 1994 he practiced as a pathologist. Dr Oettle reviewed the evidence. He prepared a report. He gave the following evidence: (T 516) 
     
      
       
       “Q. As a result of reviewing all of that information, did you form an opinion concerning the manner of death of Snezana? 
        
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. What was that? 
        
       A. I thought it was homicidal. I didn’t think it was suicidal.” 
       
      
    297   Dr Oettle provided a number of reasons for his view. I will return to those reasons later in this judgment. 
    298   Det Whyte then sought an opinion from Dr Byron Collins. Dr Collins is also a pathologist. He was at one time attached to the Department of Pathology at the Geelong Hospital (T 457). He prepared a report. His examination, when giving evidence, included the following: (T 459) 
     
      
       
       “Q. If I could ask you to refer to that report. Page 2 of it, the reason you were consulted, it was clearly indicated to you the police wanted some guidance in relation to pathology findings so far as they might affect the stab wound by self infliction or homicide to Snezana, is that correct? 
        
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You have indicated in your opinion there was considerable doubt as to the self infliction theory? 
        
       A. Yes, that is so. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And in your preliminary report you have outlined the reasons why you think there was doubt in relation to that? 
        
       A. Yes.” 
       
      
    299   Dr Collins provided a second report. His evidence, in response to the Crown Prosecutor, took the following form: (T 466) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Would you go to that second report please? You indicate in that second report that you are of the opinion that in all probability the fatal neck wound to the throat of Snezana Velevski was not self inflicted? 
        
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. And you provided a number of points or a number of areas the combination of which you say led you to that conclusion, is that correct? 
        
       A. Yes, that is so. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You have also indicated in relation to all of those points that you raised that you are aware there are competing explanations for each of them? 
        
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. You say, when taken in toto, it is your opinion that their weight strongly points to a homicidal throat wound? 
        
       A. Yes.” 
       
      
    300   Dr Collins elaborated upon his view. 
    301   In March 1995, Det Whyte travelled to Scotland to consult with Professor Mason. Professor Mason is Professor Emeritus of Forensic Medicine at the University of Edinburgh (T 604). Professor Mason had already discussed the case with Dr Bradhurst’s colleague, Professor Hilton, and expressed some interest in it (T 607). Professor Mason gave the following evidence: (T 614) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Going to par 14 of your report? 
       
      
      
       
       A. I, at the end of the day, I think it is quite clear that I say Snezana’s cut throat is difficult to analyse in isolation and I emphasise this, analyse in isolation. If we take everything into consideration about it, I would say that on the balance of probabilities in my opinion it is a homicidal wound.” 
       
      
    302   Professor Mason relied upon a number of matters, which he identified, and about which I will comment later. 
    303   The Crown case, as ultimately presented, therefore included Dr Bradhurst, Dr Cooke, Dr Oettle, Dr Byron Collins and Professor Mason. All acknowledged that there was doubt concerning whether Snezana committed suicide (the murder/suicide hypothesis which I, for simplicity, will simply refer to as the suicide hypothesis), or was murdered (the murder/murder hypothesis which I will refer to simply as the murder hypothesis). Dr Bradhurst favoured the suicide hypothesis. Dr Cooke was undecided. Professor Mason, Dr Oettle (rather more emphatically) and Dr Byron Collins favoured the murder hypothesis. Professor Hilton, Professor Bottrill, Dr Duflou and Dr Lawrence were not called as witnesses. It was acknowledged that they favoured the suicide hypothesis. 
    304   Dr Zillman was called in the defence case. He believed that Snezana had committed suicide. 
     
      
     Matters of Concern in the Medical Evidence 
      
    305   Three matters are of concern. 
    · First, in my view, the doctors who gave evidence addressed the wrong question. They should not have been obliged, or encouraged, or ultimately permitted, to align themselves for or against, the hypothesis of murder or suicide. That may have been appropriate when reporting to the Coroner on the manner and cause of death (cf s 22 Coroners Act 1980). It was inappropriate, in my opinion, in the trial of the appellant for murder. Rather, each finding (the wounds, the position of the bodies, the location of blood, etc) should have been examined as to whether it was consistent with suicide, or with homicide, or was ambiguous (cf R v Mason (1911) 7 Cr App R 67). 
    · Secondly, it was not necessary, and in many ways undesirable, that the pathologists should have expressed a preference for one hypothesis over another. Their preference may emerge in the minds of the jury, listening to their commentary, based upon their reasoning. However, by encouraging, or permitting the doctors to address, in global terms, the ultimate issue, the pathologists tended to justify their views by resorting to matters of a non-medical nature, which were speculative. 
    · Thirdly, as the matter developed, there was an imbalance between those who favoured the suicide hypothesis, compared to those who favoured homicide. The imbalance was not the chance expression of individual views of doctors who happened to become involved. It was quite deliberate. The course pursued by Det Whyte, and ultimately the Crown Prosecutor, produced that imbalance. At the end of the Crown case, Dr Bradhurst stood alone as favouring the suicide hypothesis. An acknowledgment that his colleagues, Professors Hilton and Bottrill, and Doctors Duflou and Lawrence supported his view, was no substitute for their presence as witnesses. It is a striking feature of those who favoured the murder hypothesis that their reasons for doing so differed. Certainly there was some overlap in their reasoning. However, even within areas which were common to more than one doctor, there were differences in emphasis. The repetition of the murder hypothesis, and the reasons for that hypothesis, through calling all witnesses who favoured that view, when other witnesses were available who might have provided balance, loaded the dice against the appellant. I believe, therefore, that whatever view is taken concerning the totality of the evidence, a miscarriage of justice has occurred in respect of this aspect, justifying a new trial. 
    306   The submissions on behalf of the appellant touched upon only some of these matters. They, nonetheless, seem to me important. I will deal with each issue in turn. 
     
      
     The Wrong Question 
      
    307   What the jury required was guidance in respect of matters of a scientific nature which they could not be expected to know without such guidance: R v Turner 1975 QB 834 at 841; Murphy v The Queen (1988-1989) 167 CLR 94 at 111. 
    308   The nature of the wounds to each victim were matters in respect of which such assistance was, no doubt, necessary. Were the multiple wounds to Snezana, and the depth of each wound, consistent with suicide? Were the small cuts to her neck truly hesitation cuts (such as one may find in suicide), or were they the consequence of a sawing action with a knife? There were many such issues. However, in circumstances where the requirement was proof beyond reasonable doubt, the view of the pathologists, on the totality of the evidence, expressed on the balance of probabilities, was irrelevant. It was also, in this case, because of the imbalance in the evidence, unfair to the accused. 
    309   Further, although s 80 of the Evidence Act 1995 provides that “Evidence of an opinion is not inadmissible only because it is about” … “an ultimate issue”, there are limits. Whether the wounds to Snezana’s throat were self-inflicted or homicide is, in one sense, an ultimate issue (R v Mason (1911) 7 Cr App R 67). Nonetheless, it is one stage removed from the issue which the pathologists addressed during the trial. Their views on the totality of the evidence, in my opinion, were beyond the limit (cf Young J in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v Bolton (1994) 33 NSWLR 735 at 738-9). Addressing that issue does not conform to the sort of limitations which Mason CJ and Toohey J appeared to have in mind when they made the following remarks in Murphy v The Queen (1988-89) 167 CLR 74 at 110/111: 
     
      
       
       “Was the evidence proposed to be led from Mr Sharpe admissible? It is unnecessary to spend time on the question whether an expert may give an opinion on the very issue of fact or law which the court has to determine. It is doubtful that there is now an absolute rule precluding an expert witness from expressing a view as to the ultimate issue: see  
       Cross on Evidence 
       , 3rd Aust ed (1986), p 717. But we do not think that question arises here. The ultimate issue was whether Leslie Murphy gave the answers which are contained in the record of interview. That was a question for the jury and Mr Sharpe’s evidence would not have usurped their function. His evidence, if accepted, would have assisted the jury in answering that question in so far as it bore upon the capacity of Murphy to comprehend what was read to him and further to give the particular answers attributed to him in the record.” 
       
      
    310   It should be said that no objection was taken, either upon the basis of relevance, or under s 80, by counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
     The Resort to Speculation 
      
    311   Section 76 of the Evidence Act 1995 is in these terms: 
     
      
       
       “s 76. Evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed.” 
       
      
    312   There are a number of exceptions. The exception provided by s 79 is relevant. Section 79 is in these terms: 
     
      
       
       “s 79. If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.” 
       
      
    313   Gaudron J in HG v The Queen ((1999) 73 ALJR 281) said this, referring to s 79: (at 289/90) 
     
      
       
       “The position at common law is that, if relevant, expert or opinion evidence is admissible with respect to matters about which ordinary persons are unable ‘to form a sound judgment … without the assistance of [those] possessing special knowledge or experience … which is sufficiently organized or recognized to be accepted as a reliable body of knowledge or experience’ ( 
       R v Bonython  
       (1984) 38 SASR 45 at 46-47 per King J …). There is no reason to think that the expression ‘specialised knowledge’ gives rise to a test which is in any respect narrower or more restrictive than the position at common law.” 
       
      
    314   Gleeson CJ, in the same case, made the following observation: (at 287) 
     
      
       
       “However, the witness had to identify the expertise he could bring to bear ( 
       Murphy v The Queen 
        (1989) 167 CLR 94 at 111), and as  
       Clark v Ryan 
        (1960) 103 CLR 486) illustrates, his opinions had to be related to his expertise.” 
       
      
    315   The Chief Justice added: (at 288) 
     
      
       
       “This was not a trial by jury, but in trials before judges alone, as well as in trials by jury, it is important that the opinions of expert witnesses be confined, in accordance with s 79, to opinions which are wholly or substantially based on their specialised knowledge. Experts who venture ‘opinions’, (sometimes merely their own inference of fact), outside their field of specialised knowledge may invest those opinions with a spurious appearance of authority, and legitimate processes of fact-finding may be subverted.” 
       
      
    316   Here Dr Cooke identified a number of matters which appeared to him to be incompatible with the hypothesis of suicide by Snezana. The matters included the following evidence, given over objection: (T 393) 
     
      
       
       “A. … At least two buttons are missing, each with residual cotton threads. A third intact button is associated with tearing/cutting of the button hole. I understand no buttons were found at the scene. These features on the jacket may indicate a struggle.” 
       
      
    317   Dr Oettle justified his opinion (that the manner of death was murder) by identifying a number of matters which included: (T 517) 
     
      
       
       “ … that her nightie was displaced up over the front of the lower abdomen, relative to the position of the nightie over the back of the trunk.” 
       
      
    318   Dr Oettle inferred from this, and certain parallel blood smears which he interpreted as having been caused by fingers, that Snezana had been pulled downwards. 
    319   Dr Oettle attached significance to a displaced hairclip in Snezana’s hair. He said this: (T 518) 
     
      
       
       “The pattern of blood spray and distribution of blood on the bed, the cabinet beside the bed, the wall behind the head of the bed, the heater and the carpet adjacent to the bed, are all consistent with Snezana lying face down on the bed with her head and shoulders over the side while her head was extended by her hair being pulled from behind thereby displacing the hair clip backwards.” 
       
      
    320   Dr Oettle also found support for his hypothesis of homicide in the following: (T 521) 
     
      
       
       “Q. Now you have indicated in your report that owing to Dr Cook’s description of the mortis and the state of the buttons and button hole, that was very suggestive of a struggle? 
        
       A. Yes, I think it is.” 
       
      
    321   Professor Mason’s evidence included the following: (T 610) 
     
      
       
       “Q. I will repeat that. You said the disturbance of a slip or nightdress is compatible with her having been pushed into that position? 
        
       A. Yes. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Or I will put this to you: Is it also compatible with her having been pulled into that position? 
        
       A. Yes.” 
       
      
    322   There are other examples. 
    323   The role of pathologists is somewhat unusual. As mentioned, they do attend the murder scene to obtain visual assistance in their determination of the manner and cause of death. However, in a murder trial it is necessary to ensure that the inferences they drew (from photographs in the case of Dr Oettle and Professor Mason) were matters within their expertise. 
    324   Here none of the matters set out above were, in my view, susceptible to expert evidence by the pathologist concerned. The displacement of Snezana’s nightie may have come about in any number of ways, including its displacement by Dr Bradhurst when he examined Snezana. Dr Bradhurst said this: (T 285) 
     
      
       
       “A. I didn’t make a record of - at what stage I took the rectal temperature but probably when the bodies were - as they were originally found whilst Snezana was in that original position, would be the time that I took her rectal temperature and took vaginal and - sorry took rectal smears and the pants may have been rolled down because of that. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Do you have a recollection of rolling the pants down at the front like that? 
       
      
      
       
       A. No, but when you have to take the pants down at the back and they may - that may have been the reason they looked like that now.” 
       
      
    325   He added: (T 285) 
     
      
       
       “Q. I want to suggest to you if you were taking the rectal temperature in the position where you first saw her, that would only have required you to pull the pants down from the middle of the back over the buttocks? 
       
      
      
       
       A. Yes, generally we would remove them down so that they were down and out of the way of the area of the rectum so that I could take the swabs properly and take the temperature properly.” 
       
      
    326   So, too, the absence of buttons on Snezana’s bed jacket, or the displacement of her hairclip, could have had many causes. These were matters which the Crown may have invited the jury to consider, and from which an inference of struggle might ultimately have been drawn. They were not, however, matters of medical opinion. 
     
      
      The Imbalance in the Evidence 
      
    327   The Prosecutor’s duty was to act fairly, to assist in obtaining justice between the Crown and the accused (Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657, per Dawson J at 675). In the same case Deane J said this: (at 664) 
     
      
       
       “The observance of traditional considerations of fairness requires that prosecuting counsel refrain from deciding whether to call a material witness by reference to tactical considerations. Whether or not their names appear on the back of the indictment or information, all witnesses whose testimony is necessary for the presentation of the whole picture, to the extent that it can be presented by admissible and available evidence, should be called by the Crown unless valid reason exists for refraining from calling a particular witness or witnesses, such as that the interests of justice would be prejudiced rather than served by the calling of an unduly large number of witnesses to establish a particular point.” 
       
      
    328   Dawson J, in respect of the same issue, made the following comment: (at 674) 
     
      
       
       “And if the number of witnesses available for the proof of some matter is such that in the circumstances it would be unnecessarily repetitious to call them all, then a selection may be made.” 
       
      
    329   In making that selection, the Prosecutor was obliged to act fairly. Here, Det Whyte had deliberately refrained from seeking reports from doctors whose views coincided with those of Dr Bradhurst which, broadly, favoured the appellant. Instead, he sought other views. I do not doubt that it was appropriate for him to do so. Nor do I doubt that he had no way of knowing in advance whether those views would favour the murder hypothesis or that of suicide. I also do not doubt that the Prosecution would have called such witnesses (from whom reports were solicited), whatever views they ultimately expressed. 
    330   However, in the result, three of the pathologists (Dr Oettle, Dr Byron Collins and Professor Mason), with varying degrees of emphasis, formed views distinctly adverse to the accused. Dr Cooke, although ultimately undecided on which hypothesis he favoured, nonetheless identified eight matters which suggested to him that the wound was more likely to have been inflicted by another than inflicted by Snezana. He also identified two matters which were consistent with suicide (the quiet scene, and the location of the knife in the pile of bodies). 
    331   The Crown Prosecutor, in these circumstances, ought, in my view, to have recognised that the presentation of only those witnesses from whom Det Whyte had solicited reports was potentially unfair to the accused. The other witnesses should have been called in the Crown case (Professors Hilton and Bottrill and Doctors Duflou and Lawrence). Alternatively, reports should have been solicited from them, and a selection made from all medical witnesses so that the jury had a balanced presentation of views. 
    332   I am not suggesting that the Crown must, in every case, strive for balance in the presentation of medical evidence. In some cases that would be impossible. The evidence may be all one way. However, the case against the appellant was not such a case. 
     
      
     The Medical Evidence Adverse to the Appellant 
      
    333   Most medical clues were ambiguous. There were competing views in respect of many aspects. Two matters, however, pointed strongly to the guilt of the accused, and should be dealt with: 
    · First, there was blood from the children and Snezana herself on the back of Snezana’s bed jacket. 
    · Secondly, there was blood spatter on the rear wall, behind the bed. 
    334   Dealing with the first issue, it was the Crown case that the accused had murdered Snezana first, and then cut the throats of the children over the top of her, as she lay on her stomach. By this means the blood of the children was deposited on the back of her bed jacket. There are, however, difficulties with that suggestion. Snezana had two significant wounds to her neck. The blood spatter suggested that they may have occurred at different times. Blood from the first wound was deposited, and had dried before the second wound was inflicted. Dr Bradhurst said this: (T 287) 
     
      
       
       “The blood on the back of her clothing is hard to explain whether self-infliction or homicide. If her cut throat was self-inflicted after dealing with the children it is possible that the blood came from her holding the child and the babies to her shoulder after their throats had been cut and/or during the act.” 
       
      
    335   However, the difficulties Dr Bradhurst had in explaining this aspect were no different from the difficulties other pathologists (who favoured the murder hypothesis) had in explaining other aspects of the evidence. Indeed, one argument advance",1999-05-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONMICHAEL GROVE JTuesday 20 April 199920642/96 - TIMOTHY ANDREW McDONALD by his next friend LYNNELL HOGAN v STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALESJUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR : Timothy Andrew McDonald was born on 30 March 1962, the youngest of four siblings. He is developmentally delayed to a marked degree. The exact cause of this has not been determined but his disability is profound. He has never crawled or walked. For a few months he demonstrated a capacity to roll over but he stopped doing this and is substantially incapable of independent movement. He can wave his arms and elevate from the supine to an extent. At the age of two or three he is reported to have had a few words at his disposal but these have been lost and he is limited to non verbal sound making. Those close to him regard his eyes as expressive and they recognize moods in him such as joy, fear, upset and the like. He has always been and will remain totally dependent on others for every activity of living.2 Until he reached the age of 27, the plaintiff was cared for in his home at Goulburn principally by his mother with some assistance from other family members. His mother, Mrs McDonald is now aged 67 years. She was widowed when Timothy was 16. Mrs McDonald’s own health has not been robust in recent years. She is diabetic and has been told apparently, that she has osteoporosis. She has had major surgery to her spine, the last procedure taking place in about mid 1988. 3 It came to pass that the plaintiff attended on a day basis at Strathallen Centre, a facility conducted originally by the Department of Health and taken over by the Department of Family and Community Services ( as it was then known). By gazettal on 30 June 1989 Strathallen Centre and other similar developmental disability centres were removed from the list of hospitals in the 5th Schedule to the Public Hospitals Act, that removal taking effect on 1 July 1989. I shall return to this matter. When Mrs McDonald was required to go to Sydney for surgery in 1988, she agreed to the plaintiff entering Strathallen for full time residential care, a decision which she testified that she made with reluctance: “Q. Some time in 1988 he went into full time residential care? 
     
      
       
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q. And did could you tell us how you felt in terms of whether you experienced any guilt about that, or whether you did not? 
        
        A. I think every mother of a handicapped person has this feeling of guilt. I wanted to be able to look after Timothy all my life and me being the only one to do it.” 
       
      
      
      4  
      However, in the light of experience Mrs McDonald came to terms with the situation. She gave this further evidence: 
       
       “Q. And you told us that you were satisfied with the service, had you made some assessment or judgment about it in coming to that conclusion? 
       
        A. At that time when I really put Timothy there, they had cottages out at Strathallen, and I fought like for them to be separated from the psychiatric for the developmentally delayed, and when these cottages were built I thought it was the answer to my prayers. I thought they were wonderful. They were lovely cottages and nice sized rooms.” 
       
      5  
      Timothy was accommodated in a cottage designated as No 5. He was allocated his own room and he shared the house with four other residents. By day he spent time reclined in either a bean bag or a chair in the living area. Staff attended to all his needs which of course included bathing, dressing and feeding him. He is incontinent and his lower torso was enclosed in a large napkin-like garment with urine pads placed within it. 
       
      6  
      Family members, prominently his mother and his sister Mrs Hogan spent extensive time with him. On occasions, usually in liaison with the welfare officer Mr Livermore, Timothy would spend a day at home. Towards the end of 1989 Mrs McDonald observed that her son appeared to be disturbed. Of course, he could not communicate his feelings by words but she thought he was withdrawn and that the noises he made were not in accord with normalcy and she noticed him, unusually, clinging to his brother. She consulted Mr Livermore who arranged for medical examinations but although these were undertaken the medical examiners did not detect any injury or anything that could be diagnosed as different from or super-added to his usual condition. 
       
      7  
      It has been common ground in the litigation (despite the formal declining to admit matters by the Amended Defence) that an employee at Strathallen Centre Vicki Adams, a registered nurse, committed a series of assaults upon the plaintiff whilst he was in residence at cottage No 5. I should specify that Sister Adams has not been called to give evidence by either side and accordingly she has had no opportunity to give any account of her conduct or offer any explanation she might wish to make. Other employees of Strathallen have given evidence about what they saw her do and there have been tendered records of investigation and enquiry together with statements taken in connection with them. As well the evidence includes departmental minutes, memoranda, file notes and depositions taken at Goulburn Local Court when Sister Adams was prosecuted on charges of assault. A series of relevant certificates of conviction was also tendered.  
       
      8  
      For the purposes of this litigation therefore and from that material I find that Sister Adams committed assaults upon the plaintiff. There are 12 certificates of conviction each specifying an offence of assault upon Timothy McDonald without particulars and notifying that in respect of each charge Sister Adams was released after conviction upon her entry into a recognizance in the sum of $300 without surety to be of good behaviour for three years pursuant to s 558 of the Crimes Act. As I have said, the certificates in their terms do not discriminate the various acts which constituted the individual assaults. I am satisfied that those acts included inhibiting the plaintiff’s breathing through nasal passages by placing a peg on his nose and by holding his nose between fingers; taping his mouth with micropore; pulling his head by the hair; splashing cold water on him while he was in a bath of warm water; putting a urine soaked incontinence pad on his face and stamping on his hands and feet. The evidence does not enable me to find precisely when any particular assault took place. I do not ignore the observations by Mrs McDonald which led to her request for medical examination in the latter half of 1989 but application of the standard of proof leads me to the conclusion that probably the assaults were committed between November 1989 and mid January 1990 at which latter time Sister Adams was removed from duty in the Strathallen cottages.  
       
      9  
      These assaults were witnessed by other members of staff who were junior in status to Sister Adams. I accept their further evidence that she made reference to the plaintiff from time to time in insulting terms such as referring to him as “an abortion gone wrong”. I reject however the invitation of counsel for the plaintiff to find that there were probable assaults committed by Sister Adams when others were not there to observe. The argument advanced was broadly based upon the proposition that Sister Adams were rostered from time to time on night duty. On such occasions two staff supervised five cottages and worked independently save for times when they might require the assistance of each other for a particular task such as lifting a patient/resident. At the time of Mrs McDonald’s observation of change in her son paralleling the time of the now known assaults and subsequently, Mrs McDonald’s observations included manifestations by the plaintiff of what might be called night terrors. Therefore, it was contended that it was more likely than not that the plaintiff had been the victim of other assaults at times when Sister Adams was alone at night and unobserved, given her apparent contempt for him and her propensity to commit assaults upon him. I am unwilling to draw an inference of the probable occurrence of assault or assaults from the circumstances demonstrated by the evidence other than those testified to by the witnesses. 
       
      10  
      Upon being informed of Mrs McDonald’s concerns about her observations of change in her son’s demeanour, Mr Livermore had arranged for medical examinations which detected no sign of injury on the body. The misconduct of Sister Adams came to the attention of management at Strathallen as a result of information provided by a Sister Kennedy, a staff member who reported to Mr Aubrey a nursing unit manager who in turn informed the Mr Boyle the Director of Nursing. This chain of information passing occurred approximately 15 to 17 January 1990. There is evidence to suggest that some complaint about Sister Adams’ conduct had earlier been passed to Mr Mills (a senior charge nurse) on about 10 January but his response was to indicate that he would not do anything unless he was given written confirmation of complaint. His position was immediately above that of Sister Adams being senior and junior charge nurses respectively. They were described as friends and were said to socialize outside of the work environment. I consider it would be entirely prudent to require any complaint about serious misconduct to be submitted in writing. The possible reaction to such complaint is suspension of an employee and ultimate dismissal and it would be a quite unreasonable administration which risked the complainant varying, ameliorating or even denying the substance of oral communication upon which action had been taken. The tone of submissions on behalf of the plaintiff was that there was something sinister about Mr Mills’ reaction but I do not find it a matter for criticism. 
       
      11  
      A letter dated 24 January 1990 was sent by Mr Boyle to Sister Adams (Exhibit 3) and it referred to an earlier communication of 19 January in which charges under the Public Sector Management Act were notified. Sister Adams never thereafter returned to work at Strathallen. A preliminary enquiry was directed to be undertaken by Mr Smith the Deputy Director of Nursing by the terms of an Instrument dated 1 February 1990. On 7 February 1990 Mr Smith reported (Exhibit N) recommending pursuit of some of the charges already notified together with some additional charges. He made a recommendation to extend the “time frame” of charges to span from 1 August 1989 to 10 January 1990 but this does not cause me to depart from my finding on the evidence that the relevant assaults probably took place no earlier than November 1989. After an ensuing formal interview the delegate of the Director General recommended on 18 June 1990 that Sister Adams be dismissed from the Public Service. On 22 June 1990 Sister Adams sent by facsimile transmission a letter of resignation expressed to take effect from that day (Exhibit DD). On 27 June 1990 approval was given to its acceptance on those terms (Exhibit CC).  
       
      12  
      On 26 January 1990 Mr Boyle and Mr Livermore had called on Mrs McDonald. The detail of what was conveyed on this occasion is not clear and there is some dispute, however it is plain that Mrs McDonald was informed that it was alleged that Timothy had been assaulted by a staff nurse. I am satisfied that the officers declined to nominate the nurse at that stage but that they informed Mrs McDonald that an investigation was taking place and that more information would be forthcoming when it had been finalized. I do not doubt that Mrs McDonald was shocked by this news and she became distressed at not being privy to the detail of the allegations immediately. Thereafter she aggressively pursued whatever avenues occurred to her to gain further information. Mrs McDonald complained that from the interview on 26 January she gained the impression that the number of charges was limited to two and that it was only much later (in August) that she learned of the larger number. I am not satisfied that anyone sought to deceive her but I am satisfied that the departmental employees restricted her access to information until the procedures under the Public Sector Management Act were completed. I do not find that such restriction was improper.  
       
      13  
      On 31 July 1990 the Department of Family and Community Services wrote to Mrs McDonald in these terms (Exhibit Q): 
       
       “I am writing to inform you of the course of events since my previous letter of 12 March 1990. At that time a preliminary inquiry that had been instituted under the disciplinary provisions of the Public Sector Management Act 1988 was in train. 
       
        Following consideration of the report of the preliminary inquiry I issued a letter of charge to Sister Adams regarding nine alleged breaches of discipline relating to her care of clients, including your son Timothy, at the “Strathallen” Centre. Sister Adams formally responded to the charges on 2 May 1990, denying all the allegations and requesting an interview with an officer nominated by me, as was her right under the Act. 
        
        Sister Adams was interviewed on 4 June 1990 in the presence of an officer of the Nurses Association by Mr David Sherlock, Director of Operations (Disability Services). Mr Sherlock subsequently recommended that Sister Adams be dismissed from the Public Service. This recommendation was approved by the Deputy Director General (Mr Marchant) on 20 June 1990. 
        
        Prior to the service on Sister Adams of this decision she submitted her resignation with effect from 22 June 1990. After consideration the Deputy Director General accepted Ms Adams’ resignation. 
        
        In my earlier letter to you I stated that the Department demands the highest possible standards of skill, care and commitment from its staff. The actions taken by the Department in this mater confirm my statement. 
        
        I re-affirm my earlier assurances that you need have no further anxiety for Timothy’s welfare.” 
       
      14  
      Mrs McDonald testified that someone from the department had telephoned her and told her that Sister Adams had been dismissed and when she learned that, in lieu of dismissal, resignation had been accepted she felt that she had not been told the truth. She was unable precisely to locate the time of information receipt and it is quite conceivable that she was told that a decision had been made to dismiss Sister Adams (as it was) and, as the evidence shows that the acceptance of resignation followed a subsequent decision, both communications might well have been accurate at the time they were made.  
       
      15  
      Mrs McDonald sought all the documentation concerning the enquiry and this was not supplied to her. Some insight is available from a document tendered by the plaintiff (Exhibit WW) which is an undated briefing note to the Minister from Ms Meredith (a regional officer) which noted that the above recited letter to Mrs McDonald had been sent following her request for full documentation, however: 
       
       “Mrs McDonald was extremely angry and upset that she had not received the information which she requested from the Department and contacted Mr Kerry Boyle and indicated that she was considering approaching the media including the Hinch Program, and the Redfern Legal Rights Centre, and that she intended to exercise her rights under the Freedom of Information Act.” 
       
      16  
      On 14 August 1990 Ms Meredith and Mr Boyle visited Mrs McDonald and gave her details substantially amounting to particulars of the assaults. Mrs McDonald asked for the information to be given to her in writing but was informed that such a request would need to be dealt with by the Director General. A further comment was added in the briefing note: 
       
       “Mrs McDonald is extremely angry, and referred to the situation, and the Department’s actions in accepting Sr. Adams’ resignation, as ‘despicable’, ‘unforgivable’, and stated that she does not intend to let the matter rest nor to let Sister Adams ‘get off scot-free’.” 
       
      17  
      On 30 August 1990 Mrs McDonald took the plaintiff out of full time residence at Strathallen. He has returned for day and respite care on occasions since then. A schedule of attendances has been extracted (Exhibit 7) from which it can be observed in passing that at a time critical to the emergence of complaints about Sister Adams namely between 15 and 22 January 1990, the plaintiff was coincidentally on “short leave” in his mother’s care.  
       
      18  
      In October 1996 the plaintiff entered full time care at St John of God Hospital, Goulburn from where he was transferred to Waminda Nursing Home on 13 January 1997. He remains there. Although this is primarily an aged facility, the plaintiff has an air conditioned single bedroom. A letter from the Director of Nursing at Waminda (Exhibit SS) described the situation, the simple things provided to occupy or amuse the plaintiff and the interesting comment that although he has no useful speech “by clever use of body language and the tone of his voice, one is able to deduce his wants, likes and so on”. The Director stated that there was “no reason to assume that Timothy will be unable to remain here for as long as he or his family wishes.”  
       
      19  
      This action was commenced in the District Court in 1995. It was transferred to this Court by an order made on 27 May 1996.  
       
      20  
      The plaintiff’s claims were advanced in an Amended Statement of Claim filed on 9 April 1997 and I deal with them in accordance with that pleading. In short, the plaintiff claimed: 
       
       (1) That the defendant was vicariously liable in tort for the trespasses to the person of the plaintiff by Sister Adams; 
       
        (2) That compensatory, aggravated and exemplary damages should be awarded in respect of those trespasses; 
        
        (3) That the defendant was vicariously liable for the negligence of the members of the staff at Strathallen who failed to report observed instances of abuse; 
        
        (4) That those omissions by staff members were causative of damage to the plaintiff and compensatory and aggravated damages were sought; 
        
        (5) That the defendant in the management by the Department of Family and Community Services of Strathallen Centre failed to institute and maintain adequate systems which ought to have avoided the trespasses or the continuation of them; 
        
        (6) That the failure to institute and maintain an adequate and safe system was causative of damage to the plaintiff and compensatory, aggravated and exemplary damages were sought, and 
        
        (7) As a particular item of compensatory damage the plaintiff sought the cost of 24 hour care at rates applicable for commercial carers for the ministrations of the plaintiff’s mother and other family members during the period from August 1990 when he left Strathallen until October 1996 when he entered St John of God Hospital. 
       
      21  
      It is a matter of extreme difficulty to assess what actual damage the assaults caused. Mrs McDonald and Mrs Hogan described their perceptions of the plaintiff’s changed demeanour, however the medical examination which followed the reports to Mr Livermore detected nothing of significance. I gained the impression that Mrs McDonald’s anger, as for example conveyed in the remarks attributed to her in the above quote from the briefing note, continues unabated and that that mood was also to an extent shared by Mrs Hogan. Whilst I do not doubt their loving devotion to the plaintiff (a matter for obvious admiration), I am persuaded that their assessments are affected by passion and lack objectivity and where there is difference I prefer other assessments. 
       
      22  
      The various staff members who gave evidence of Sister Adams’ conduct were themselves familiar with the plaintiff and saw him in the frequent routine of their various employments. All of them manifested a caring interest in him. Mrs Cosgrove saw Sister Adams place micropore over the plaintiff’s mouth which she herself immediately went to remove but this provoked Sister Adams to do so. She also witnessed an incident of splashing with cold water whilst the plaintiff was in the bath. Her observation was that after these incidents the plaintiff settled down easily and fairly quickly. Mrs Koromikalou saw Sister Adams hold the plaintiff’s nose as a consequence of which his face turned blue. She also saw an incident when Sister Adams stamped upon the plaintiff’s feet while he was sitting on a bean bag. The plaintiff’s lower limbs are markedly underdeveloped. On each occasion she described the plaintiff as reacting by becoming hysterical. Mrs Koromikalou thought that after these events the plaintiff manifested a fear of Sister Adams but after her departure in January 1990 she thought he was back to his old self, saying “He was alright in a happy environment. If he is okay, he is okay. Depending on how you see to him.” 
       
      23  
      Ms Jacka observed two incidents involving Sister Adams disrupting the plaintiff’s nasal breathing, once by holding his nose with her fingers and once by placing a peg on it. She also saw Sister Adams tread on the plaintiff’s hands and feet whilst he was sitting in the bean bag. Ms Jacka said that after the departure of Sister Adams the plaintiff was “the same as he was before”. This opinion was expressed in particular concerning her observations of the plaintiff when he returned for day or respite stays after he had ceased to be a full time resident at Strathallen.  
       
      24  
      Ms Wilson saw Sister Adams place a peg on the plaintiff’s nose. Ms Wilson removed it, telling Sister Adams that she disapproved. It was claimed that the intention was to stop the plaintiff regurgitating food but Ms Wilson saw that the plaintiff was in obvious distress which he showed by waving his arms about. She thought he settled down quickly after the peg was removed. She judged that the plaintiff was well settled in cottage 5 and appeared to be so when he returned from day or respite care after he had been withdrawn by Mrs McDonald in August 1990. 
       
      25  
      Ms Whittaker saw the plaintiff with a peg on his nose although she did not see who applied it. Sister Adams was in charge of the cottage at the time. On another occasion she saw Sister Adams hold a bib over the plaintiff’s face after he had regurgitated some food. She witnessed a further incident when Sister Adams pulled the plaintiff’s head by the hair. She perceived an annoyed reaction by the plaintiff who made non verbal sounds of distress. In her testimony Ms Whittaker claimed little memory of these events now many years past but she asserted that she and others on the staff, with the exception of Sister Adams, saw that the plaintiff was well cared for. 
       
      26  
      Ms Shoppee saw Sister Adams put micropore across the plaintiff’s mouth. Ms Shoppee removed it immediately and remonstrated with her. She also saw Sister Adams hold the plaintiff’s nose in an apparent attempt to make him swallow food. Ms Shoppee asked Sister Adams to stop, which she did. She noticed the plaintiff flinch. Ms Shoppee had been familiar with the plaintiff from the time of his arrival at Strathallen. She had noted his immediate reaction to Sister Adams’ interference but overall she said that she never noticed any change in the plaintiff. 
       
      27  
      Ms Lacey had seen an incident involving Sister Adams and a resident Mr Cannon. She worked as a hospital assistant frequently at cottage No 5. She knew the plaintiff. To her observation the plaintiff appeared happy and cheerful at Strathallen including the period, to which her attention was directed, following the inquiry concerning Sister Adams and her departure.  
       
      28  
      Ms O’Donnell observed Sister Adams put a urine soaked napkin which she had removed from the plaintiff’s lower body across his face. Ms O’Donnell rebuked Sister Adams and removed the item and wiped the plaintiff’s face. Apart from the conduct by Sister Adams, Ms O’Donnell observed that the plaintiff appeared well cared for by herself and other staff and thought that he seemed to relate well to them. 
       
      29  
      There is no evidence from any source of any physical injury or damage to the plaintiff resulting from assault beyond the immediate and passing reactions to the interference with his person. There were placed in evidence two reports from Professor Shaddock, a psychologist who is a professor of special education at the University of Canberra. He would appear to have made some contribution to the record in the BIALA booklets (Exhibit 9A and B). Professor Shaddock emphasized that he was not a medical practitioner but recognized that it was necessary to contemplate medical factors as influential upon the plaintiff’s life and situation. He made three visits to the McDonald household in September, October and December 1995. Although under a heading in his report indicating an overview of findings, it is obvious that the factual matters as to behaviour were derived by him from reports of others. His comment included the following: 
       
       “Early reports state that, at the time of the abuse, there were behavioural indicators (night time screaming, uncharacteristic fearfulness) that could have been interpreted as indicators that something in his life was disturbing him. Such behaviours are, in the literature, associated with physical abuse. However medical investigations at that time were inconclusive. 
       
        Mr McDonald now lives at home, receiving day care at the Strathallen Centre and fortnightly respite care at a private residence. Although he generally appears quite happy, he is more wary and cautious than before the abuse. He needs reassurance (from his mother) before he relaxes in the presence of strangers. He has also made some developmental gains since living at home. 
        
        I found no indisputable evidence of long term, direct, negative effects on Mr McDonald of the abuse. 
        
        However, since the abuse of Mr McDonald’s there has been some deterioration in aspects of Mr McDonald’s behaviour. He is now abnormally vigilant and apprehensive; he needs constant reassurance; he is upset by breaks in routine and he displays a general fearfulness.” 
       
      30  
      The statement that medical investigations were inconclusive must be taken in the context of support for the hypothesis of assault and injury. The medical investigations detected no damage nor any condition of the plaintiff different from his normal presentation. 
       
      31  
      In a later report Professor Shaddock adhered to his view concerning the absence of long term, direct, negative effects of the abuse but expressed a qualification (on the probabilities) concerning the desirability of taking the plaintiff home from Strathallen. I shall return to the issue of the plaintiff being brought home when dealing with the claim for damages for provision of voluntary services. Professor Shaddock also commented upon a series of reports including those from Mrs McDonald and Mrs Hogan that the plaintiff cried and squealed inconsolably at night, pinched and picked at his body, clung to family members and regressed in the trust which he showed but wanting people to hold him. Mrs McDonald also felt she was “snubbed” by her son after she was absent for a few days at a family funeral interstate. It is not possible to connect the lastmentioned with any event at Strathallen. However Professor Shaddock reported: 
       
       “The literature on abuse of people with intellectual disability indicates that the behaviours described above are frequently the indicators of physical abuse. Fortunately most of these behavioural changes appear to have been temporary in Mr McDonald’s case. However, it was reported that Mr McDonald now appears to be habitually more anxious and insecure and he requires more stability and dependability in his immediate environment. He is also more wary of strangers, particularly and (inexplicably), of men. He needs constant reassurance from those he trusts. This general fearfulness was also reported by other informants.” 
       
      32  
      I find that each of the assaults had immediate impact upon the plaintiff in causing him hurt and distress and that as a result, there were engendered in him for a time feelings of fear and mistrust. The evidence does not enable precise determination of when the consequential effects ceased but it does not satisfy me that they are continuing and, on the probabilities, I hold that any effect attributable to the assaults had ceased after the expiry of 12 months beyond the events. I am not suggesting that I find that they lasted for 12 months but I have selected that as an outer marker point, as it were, of consequences.  
       
      33  
      I am conscious of course of the expression of view by Mrs McDonald in particular that the effects are continuing but I consider that that perception is derived from her own anxieties and not from any tort induced damage to the plaintiff. The assaults were, of course, criminal as well as tortious. Mrs McDonald’s subjectivity is demonstrated in a remark reported in 1992 by Ms Barbey, a Goulburn community nurse coordinating developmental disability services: 
       
       “No-one can understand the horror I feel when I think that Timothy may have to return to Strathallen when I am no longer able to manage.” 
       
      34  
      It is beyond argument that Sister Adams would, if sued, be liable to pay damages to the plaintiff for the assaults. The first basis upon which claim is made against the defendant is that it is vicariously liable for her conduct. All of the assaults occurred in the course of employment with the defendant. Sister Adams has claimed or has been reported to have claimed that the instances of nasal obstruction (by fingers or pegs) and mouth taping were designed to provoke swallowing regurgitated food during feeding of the plaintiff. I do not accept such claims in the sense that any legitimate form of nursing would call for such action but these were activities which were undertaken in purported performance of a particular employment task. I have not overlooked the denials by Sister Adams reported in the preliminary inquiry (Exhibit N) but I do not regard them as either acceptable or determinative of the nexus between her acts and her employment.  
       
      35  
      I find that the assaults consisting of stamping on hands and feet, flinging the urine soaked napkin in the face, and pulling the hair are in a different category in the sense that it has never been claimed (so far as the evidence called reveals) that any of these acts was done in connection with any particular reference to a task being undertaken in the course of Sister Adams’ employment. 
       
      36  
      Sister Adams asserted to Mr Smith who was conducting the preliminary inquiry that she did not use cold water on the plaintiff but had mixed hot and cold water to obtain lukewarm liquid which needed to be done in that way in the absence of appropriate facilities such as a hose. The evidence in the trial by Ms Cosgrove was that the water was cold which she could assess because it splashed on her also. The credibility of Sister Adams’ reported explanation to Mr Smith was undermined by the testimony from Ms Cosgrove that at the time she remarked “It’s good value”. 
       
      37  
      The potential liability of the Crown in the right of the State of New South Wales has been declared in the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 which provides: 
       
       “8(1) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the Crown is vicariously liable in respect of the tort committed by a person in the service of the Crown in the performance or purported performance by the person of a function (including an independent function) where the performance or purported performance of the function: 
       
        
         
         (a) is in the course of his service with the Crown or is an incident of his service (whether or not it was a term of his appointment to the service of the Crown that he perform the function); or 
          
         (b) is directed to or is incidental to the carrying on of any business, enterprise, undertaking or activity of the Crown.” 
         
        
       
      38  
      Attention to that provision has recently been given in  
      Prior v The State of New South Wales 
       CA unreported 23 October 1998. Although differing from the primary judge’s conclusion in that case, Meagher JA recited without disapproval a construction of that provision that in order to found liability first, one must find a tort committed by a person in the service of the Crown, second that the person was actually or purportedly performing a “function” and third, that the tort must have been committed by the person in the performance or purported performance of that function. Sheller JA (with whom Handley JA agreed) referred to  
      Commonwealth of Australia v Connell 
       1986 5 NSWLR 218: 
       
       “I would conclude that conduct by an apprentice sailor is within the scope of his service or duty or authority if it is authorised expressly or impliedly or is incidental to what he is authorised to do even though it may be performed in an unauthorised way. If, however, it is not authorised expressly or impliedly and is not so connected with authorised conduct as to be an improper mode of performing it, it is an independent unauthorised act and is outside the scope of his service.” Per Glass JA, Samuels and Priestley JJA concurring, 
       
       and to  
       Tiger Nominees Pty Limited v State Pollution Control Commission 
        1992 25 NSWLR 715 where Gleeson CJ, (Mahoney JA and Campbell J concurring) adopted as a test for determining vicarious responsibility (in that case a criminal responsibility) attaching to an employer, the distinction “between a mode, albeit improper, of doing that which the employee is employed to do and conduct which is outside the scope of the employee’s employment”. 
       
      39  
      Whilst vicarious liability undoubtedly has an arbitrary quality, the tendency has been towards imposition. It was long ago held that a principal was liable for the fraud of an agent acting within the scope of authority even if committed for the benefit of the agent:  
      Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co 
       1912 AC 716. The public policy factor is recognizable in very early expressions of judicial thought. Sir John Holt wrote in 1700 “…….. seeing somebody must be a loser by (this) deceit, it is more reason that he that employs and puts a trust and confidence in the deceiver should be a loser, than a stranger”:  
      Hern v Nichols 
       1701 1 Salk 289. That observation was in this century described by Scarman LJ (as he then was) as prophetic wisdom ( 
      Rose v Plenty 
       1976 1 All ER 97) and, in similar vein to the situation noted by Lord Scarman in  
      Rose 
      , I would recognize that that wisdom has no direct application to the present case but there is “a family relationship”. 
       
      40  
      The issue for determination is the vicarious liability of the defendant for the trespasses to the person of the plaintiff by Sister Adams. Although I accept that the actions in every case were incapable of being performed in the proper administration of nursing care, Sister Adams asserted that some of them were designed to assist him particularly in suppressing food regurgitations. That purport, even if it is unacceptable, remains significant. Sister Adams was employed, inter alia, to attend to feeding the plaintiff. Similarly it was an incident of her employment to bathe him and, whilst her remark at the time is suggestive of malice, in terms of the test articulated in  
      Tiger Nominees 
       this was an improper mode of doing what she was employed to do. The same comment is applicable to the removal of the urine soaked napkin which was done, I have presumed, in the course of replacing it with a clean one. There is some difficulty in reaching a similar conclusion in respect of the incidents of stamping on hands and the hair pulling but no submissions were made based upon discriminating between the assaults, the defendant contending total denial of liability. In the circumstances I am minded to find that all of the actions should be categorized as improper modes of doing what Sister Adams was in the general sense employed to do, namely to attend to the welfare and daily living needs of the plaintiff.  
       
      41  
      Accordingly I find that the defendant is vicariously liable to pay damages for trespass to the person. The nature of compensatory damages is to reflect hurt suffered. Despite the plaintiff’s inability to articulate complaint, I am satisfied that from the observations of reaction recounted by staff he was conscious that hurt was being done to him. There was no evidence of bodily harm in the sense of bruising, abrasion, laceration or like injury. I note the descriptions of mood change by Mrs McDonald and Mrs Hogan but as I have already held, I am unpersuaded that anything of that nature was causally connected to any assault by Sister Adams after the expiry of 12 months beyond her departure. A particular aspect of claim was that what I have referred to as night terrors were continuing. Mrs McDonald has described this uncontrollable squealing as being observed on occasions when the plaintiff came home as he did from time to time including late 1989. It was not until August 1990 that the plaintiff was withdrawn from Strathallen and it must be observed that there has been no evidence of any report from any member of staff of manifestation of this uncontrollable squealing at night during the period between Sister Adams departure and withdrawal of the plaintiff from Strathallen by his mother over seven months later. Other than the description of conduct of Sister Adams there was no evidence of malice towards the plaintiff and those staff and former staff who gave evidence impressed me as caring of the plaintiff and interested in his welfare. Taking all matters into account I conclude that the plaintiff probably did sometimes manifest sleep disturbance and produced sounds of discomfort but the descriptions from his mother and sister have exaggerated both the intensity and the span of time over which the behaviour was manifest. I record that this conclusion is not premised upon any finding of deliberate inaccuracy by those witnesses but the exaggeration probably stemmed from loss of objectivity consequent upon their deep anger and upset over what had happened to the plaintiff. 
       
      42  
      The arguments presented on behalf of the plaintiff claimed damages specified in categories of compensatory, aggravated and exemplary damages. I have described this first element of claimed damages as compensatory to coordinate with those submissions but it should not be ignored that damages for trespass to the person, in parallel with torts such as false arrest and false imprisonment are at large: cf  
      Spautz v Butterworths 
       1997 A Torts R 81-415. To recognize that damages are at large is not to suggest that a trial judge is authorized to select a figure arbitrarily or idiosyncratically and personal injury awards in more commonly litigated torts (such as negligence) are available to provide guidance by way of comparison:  
      Coyne v Citizen Finance Limited 
       1991 172 CLR 211. 
       
      43  
      In the present case the assaults were multiple and, to say the least, heaped indignity as well as hurt upon a completely defenceless person. It is true that the plaintiff undoubtedly lacks any appreciation of money or any form of currency but he was not indifferent to the treatment meted out to him as witness his distressed responses and the use of his limited means of expression. 
       
      44  
      I have not overlooked the slight discrepancy between the pleading which asserted 13 assaults and the certificates of conviction which total 12, however I cannot correlate the certificates to the various acts described by witnesses either by collating their evidence, the depositions from the Goulburn Local Court and/or the statements to the departmental inquiry. It suffices in the context of this litigation to find that there were multiple trespasses upon the plaintiff as described by the staff members and former staff members in their respective testimony. I have previously summarized their observations. 
       
      45  
      I have reached the conclusion that a sum of $50,000 should be awarded for the total of assaults including within that award reflection of the indignities, humiliations and mental suffering as well as any transient feelings of hurt and disturbance to comfort and well being. That sum clearly exceeds any sum proportioned to physical injury and discomfort and the inclusion of the enhancement is frequently described as an inclusion of aggravated damages. It was agreed that, should the plaintiff succeed in recovering damages there should be included two items of $2,483 and $850 (total $3,333) for certain home and respite care and the amounts will be added to the sum which I have specified. 
       
      46  
      The plaintiff’s contentions advanced a claim for aggravated damage as a separate category. The thrust of the argument was summarized in a written outline of submissions: 
       
       “Aggravated damages ought be awarded because of the manner in which the tort has been inflicted adds to the damage. It has been accompanied not only by humiliation and a total demeaning of the subject of the assault but the same has been inflicted upon a person with a mental age of less than 1 year. The respective roles of the perpetrator and the victim are so disproportionate, so far from arm’s length that aggravated damages of a massive order are called for.” 
       
      47  
      In the often quoted classification of damages by Lord Diplock ( 
      Cassell & Co v Broome 
       1972 AC 1027) aggravated damages were described as “additional compensation for the injured feelings of the plaintiff where his sense of injury resulting from the wrongful physical act is justifiably heightened by the manner in which or the motive with which the defendant did it”. 
       
      48  
      As observed in Street on  
      Damages 
       (1962) and quoted by Hogarth J in  
      Costi v Minister of Education 
       1973 5 SASR @ 332: 
       
       “Evidence of the circumstances accompanying the commission of a tort for which damages at large is a head of permissible damages will, of course, be permitted; when that evidence tends to show that a higher sum of damages will be appropriate, the higher award is often called aggravated damages. Damages are awarded in assault for the effect on the plaintiff’s mental state produced by the defendant’s threats ….. Aggravated damages then are not some separate head of damages. The essential question is what heads of damages are legally recoverable for the particular wrong. Obviously, certain heads of damage such as compensation for humiliation and insult lend themselves more readily to claims for aggravated damages ….. For at least two hundred years aggravated damages have been given for trespasses which have inflicted insult or humiliation upon the plaintiff ……” 
       
      49  
      McGregor on  
      Damages 
       (16th Edn) contains these observations: 
       
       “In so far as an assault and battery results in physical injury to the plaintiff, the damages will be calculated as in any other action for personal injury. However, beyond this, the tort of assault affords protection from the insult which may arise from interference with the person. Thus a further important head of damage is the injury to feelings, i.e. the indignity, mental suffering, disgrace and humiliation that may be caused. Damages may thus be recovered by a plaintiff for an assault, with or without a technical battery, which has done him no physical injury at all. While damages for the injury to feelings may be given without their being classified as aggravated damages, it is usual to find, in the very few existing authorities, that the court does make its award one of aggravated damages.” 
       
      50  
      The inclusion in the assessment which I have already made of compensation for hurt, indignity and humiliation would be duplicated were I to make a separate award enhancing the already stated sum.  
       
      51  
      One of the difficulties in dealing with these claims is the circumstance that until 1964 Anglo-Australian courts did not distinguish between aggravated and exemplary damages. See Luntz, Assessment of Damages 3rd End Chap 1.7.1. Subsequent history has made the approach contended for by the plaintiff understandable and I recognize that there have been cases of separate awards in three categories: e.g.  
      Stepanovic v G.I.O. 
       CA Unreported 29 March 1995. On the other hand references in earlier cases to exemplary damages can be identified as what would now be called aggravated damages rather than exemplary (punitive) damages or, most often, a combination of them both. 
       
      52  
      In the present case, compensatory damages directly proportioned to actual injury would not greatly exceed a nominal sum but I have included in the assessment of $50,000 the factors abovementioned. There is little available guidance for an appropriate figure, if indeed there be one. In a somewhat exotic case, a defendant who was banker, magistrate and Member of Parliament (said to have dined and drunk freely) upon his request to join a shooting party being declined entered land with his dogs and fired at game (seeking to borrow more shot when his own was exhausted) and in intemperate language defied the plaintiff estate owner to bring action:  
      Merest v Harvey 
       1814 5 Taunt 442; 128 ER 761. A verdict of five hundred pounds was left undisturbed although it must be conceded that the language of Gibbs CJ appears to emphasize the punitive character of permissible award. Heath J (who had tried the action at Norfolk assizes but sat with the Chief Justice in Common Pleas) remarked that he remembered a case where a jury gave five hundred pounds for knocking a man’s hat off and the court refused a new trial. He added that the permission of juries to punish insult by exemplary damages would go to prevent the practice of duelling. This rather dated reference is made to demonstrate that (given the combination of aggravated/punitive damages) comparatively large sums of money have been deemed appropriate. 
       
      53  
      In  
      Stepanovic 
       separate awards of $10,000 and $15,000 for aggravated and exemplary damages respectively were left undisturbed. The trespass arose out of a single event whereas Timothy McDonald was the victim of multiple interferences. It is convenient to mention that in  
      Stepanovic 
       the Court (Kirby P, Priestley JA) affirmed the appropriateness of taking into account on the question of aggravated damages both the conduct of the assailant and the subsequent conduct of the litigation. So far as the latter is concerned, I have mentioned that the hearing was conducted on the basis that the commission of the assaults by Sister Adams was not disputed. The liability of the defendant for her actions was a matter of bona fide contest and I do not find the failure to concede the assaults in the pleadings was a matter of significant additional hurt to the plaintiff in all the circumstances of this case. 
       
      54  
      The foregoing is recorded in connection with my ultimate judgment that, in today’s terms of monetary value, damages should be assessed at $50,000. Counsel for the plaintiff specifically submitted that general and aggravated damages should combine to a figure of $150,000. That figure was, as my assessment has had to be, significantly the result of impression but I was invited to draw some comparison from the experiences of agony resulting from stroke-induced paralysis described by the author Jean-Dominique Bauby in “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly”. Ultimately damages at large must be assessed upon the evidence in a particular case gauged in the context of contemporary society and its perceived values. It would not be astonishing if perceptions failed to coincide. 
       
      55  
      I turn to the claim for exemplary damages. The nature of these was described by Lord Diplock in  
      Cassell 
       as “punishment of the defendant for his anti-social behaviour to the plaintiff”. Windeyer J in  
      Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Limited 
       1966 117 CLR 118 proposed that “….. exemplary damages …… are intended to punish the defendant, and presumably serve one or more of the objects of punishment - moral retribution and deterrence.” 
       
      56  
      This claim of course related to vicarious liability of the defendant for the actions of the wrongdoer, Sister Adams, who was not personally sued. It is difficult to conceive that such a derivative liability would call for punishment in the circumstance that the payer of damages is liable by imputation rather than action and provides a strong basis for exercising discretion against such an award. I do not ignore that in  
      Lamb v Cotogno 
       1987 164 CLR 1 the tortfeasor was indemnified under a compulsory scheme of insurance and that it was contemplated in that case that in condemning the actual wrongdoer (who was a defendant) the award of exemplary damages would appease the victim and assuage any urge for revenge. The plaintiff in this particular case by reason of his inherent developmental disability would not be capable of harbouring urges such as a desire for vengeance. 
       
      57  
      There is however a more important reason contra indicating an award of exemplary damages because, as the evidence of the certificates of conviction demonstrates, the wrongdoer herself has already had the criminal law brought to bear on her for her actions. In  
      Gray v Motor Accident Commission 
       1998 73 ALJR 45 a joint judgment (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) proclaimed this view: 
       
       “[40] Where, as here, the criminal law has been brought to bear upon the wrongdoer and substantial punishment inflicted, we consider that exemplary damages may not be awarded. We say ‘may not’ because we consider that the infliction of substantial punishment for what is substantially the same conduct as the conduct which is the subject of the civil proceeding is a bar to the award; the decision is not one that is reached as a matter of discretion dependent upon the facts and circumstances in each particular case. 
       
        [41] There are at least two reasons in principle why that is so. 
        
        [42] First the purposes for the awarding of exemplary damages have been wholly met if substantial punishment is exacted by the criminal law. The offender is punished; other are deterred. There is, then, no occasion for their award. 
        
        [43] Secondly, considerations of double punishment would otherwise arise. In  
       R v Hoar 
        Gibbs CJ Mason, Aickin and Brennan JJ said that there is ‘a practice, if not a rule of law, that a person should not be twice punished for what is substantially the same act’. That practice or rule would be breached by an award of exemplary damages in the circumstances described.” 
       
      58  
      The penalties visited upon Sister Adams were non custodial. In  
      Gray 
       the Court did not need to determine what extent of punishment would meet the requirement of being “substantial” but after noting that that issue did not fall for decision in that case their Honours observed: 
       
       “[46] ……….. At first sight, however, if criminal charges, alleging the same conduct as is alleged in a civil proceeding, have been brought and proved, it would be a most unusual case in which it was open to a civil court to conclude that the outcome of those criminal proceedings did not take sufficient account of the need to punish the offender and deter others from like conduct. There seems to be much to be said in favour of the views reached by a majority of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand in  
      Daniels v Thompson 
       that for a civil court to revisit a sentence imposed in a criminal court for the purpose of deciding whether the criminal received his or her just deserts is ‘contrary to principle’ and must ‘undermine the criminal process’.” 
       
      59  
      There is some Canadian authority for the proposition that where a defendant has been conditionally discharged in criminal proceedings exemplary damages may remain available:  
      Connors v Doak 
       1978 24 NBR 2d (85) ( a case of conversion of goods) but I would doubt that a conditional discharge under s 662.1(1) of the Criminal Code of New Brunswick is necessarily an equivalently substantial penalty to deferral of sentence on conditions pursuant to s 558 of the Crimes Act. 
       
      60  
      I derive guidance from the dictum in  
      Gray 
       and am fortified by the expressed favour for the approach in New Zealand revealed in  
      Daniels 
       and in addition to the reasons already stated, I would decline to enhance the damages which I have assessed by an element of exemplary damages.  
       
      61  
      The first alternative presentation of the plaintiff’s case is as an action in negligence asserting vicarious liability of the defendant arising out of the omissions of nursing staff and hospital assistants to report their observations of abuse of the plaintiff by Sister Adams to authority. It was conceded by counsel that, even if this cause of action were to be made out it could not attract exemplary damages. 
       
      62  
      It is implicit in the case framed in this fashion that sooner reporting would have avoided some of the damage to the plaintiff. A staff member obviously could only report what he or she saw and thus even the promptest reporting could not logically have avoided the first incident even if it was observed. There was an understandable lack of precision about when any event seen by the various witnesses took place. The state of the evidence makes it quite impossible therefore to find when any particular assault took place and consequently what damage might have been avoided if early reporting had been made. By reason of the deficit in evidence, there exists also an obstacle to finding causation of damage by any specific failure to report and a general allegation of failure to report does not sustain the cause of action. Even if this conclusion be incorrect, I would not assess the damages any differently from those which I have determined in relation to the cause of action pleaded in trespass. 
       
      63  
      The second alternative cause of action can briefly be described as couched in terms of an action for negligence arising out of the alleged failure of the Department of Family and Community Services to devise, institute and maintain systems of operation so as to avoid unnecessary risk of injury to the plaintiff. Over objection, I permitted the plaintiff to file amended particulars of negligence in advancement of the claim in these terms: 
       
       “(i) Failed to exercise sufficient supervision over its nursing staff to prevent unlawful assaults upon intellectually disabled residents in its care; 
       
        (ii) Failed to ensure the safety of all disabled residents at Strathallen; 
        
        (iii) Failed to ensure that nursing staff at Strathallen delivered nursing service to residents in accordance with a standard expected of skilled and competent nursing staff; 
        
        (iv) Failed to adequately train staff to intervene to protect residents whose welfare was being abused by other staff; 
        
        (v) Failed to maintain an adequate grievance procedure for staff to notify the management of the Department of Family & Community Services of the misconduct of other staff members; 
        
        (vi) Failed to prevent any further assaults occurring on residents after becoming aware of such assaults on residents; 
        
        (vii) Failed to ensure that the plaintiff’s family was alerted to any abuse to which he was subjected immediately upon becoming aware of such abuse; 
        
        (viii) Failure to guard against a known and documented risk of abuse within facilities such as Strathallen; 
        
        (ix) Failed to put in place systems or procedures which would have avoided the assaults upon the plaintiff or the continuation of them; 
        
        (x) Failed to report abuse which had been observed or witnessed; 
        
        (xi) Failed by investigation or otherwise to uncover abuse to the plaintiff when behavioural changes indicative of abuse were drawn to the attention of Mr Livermore and/or the hospital administration; 
        
        (xii) Failed to have systems or procedures in relation to abuse or the reporting of it or its possible indicia that would have brought such matters as Mr Livermore drew attention to, to the attention of the Executive Officer; 
        
        (xiii) Allowing verbal abuse to continue unchecked; 
        (xiv) Failing to treat verbal abuse as a warning of the possible or likely occurrence of other abuse; 
        (xv) Failing to enquire of staff as to whether abuse or indicia of abuse had been observed.” 
       
      64  
      The plaintiff’s case on this cause was sought to be supported by a considerable volume of documents in handbooks, reports, policy statements and departmental memoranda. It was contended by the defendant that there was no evidence of what the system should have been and that, in the absence of expert evidence, I could not by a process of divination as it were, determine what a reasonable system should have been. There is evidence of the institution of new systems and procedures which, if they had been in effect, probably would have brought Sister Adams’ misdeeds to attention earlier and probably would have prevented at least some of them. It was argued by the defendant that the change emerged upon the introduction of new legislation, and that is historically so, but it was not suggested that legislation was an essential pre-requisite to adoption of more effective systems for the reporting of and the prevention of misconduct by staff. The new system demonstrated what might have been done if minds had at the relevant time been turned to the possible problem. I do not mean to assert that every aspect of change wrought by what was referred to as the “new Act” could have occurred in the absence of the statute but there was no inhibition on introducing some effective procedures at an earlier date. 
       
      65  
      Some forceful submissions were advanced on behalf of the plaintiff asserting that the removal of Strathallen Centre from the schedule to the Public Hospitals Act was germane to the causation of the plaintiff’s damage. I specifically reject the contention that legislative action or authorized “de-gazettal” was an element in founding any private right in the plaintiff.  
       
      66  
      I do not regard it as necessary to analyse the issues raised on this cause of action in detail because the outcome of the litigation by way of verdict will not alter and it suffices to record that I find that on the probabilities some of the assaults by Sister Adams would have been avoided if reasonable attention had been paid to devising an adequate system for having the misbehaviour of staff reported and an adequate system instituted for ensuring appropriate response to report of such misbehaviour. Part of any such system would involve communicating to staff what their responsibilities were in relation to reporting and establishing alternative means of so doing so that rigid adherence to a chain of authority would not frustrate reporting that was needed where the alleged miscreant was a superior to the would-be informant. That conclusion does not require expertise or specific knowledge of any particular bureaucratic structure.  
       
      67  
      In my view therefore, subject to the claims for aggravated and exemplary damages in the terms pursued, the plaintiff’s success on this cause of action would not attract compensatory damages greater than would be payable in respect of the trespass. Non-punitive damages for trespass and negligence arising out of the same events are not recoverable cumulatively and it would become something of a hypothetical exercise to further pursue this alternative cause of action. I would not enhance the compensatory damages consequent upon a finding in favour of the plaintiff in negligence. The negligence of the defendant did not heighten the injuries or sense of injury by the manner or motive whereby the tort was committed. Appeasement and assuagement of desire for revenge are not relevant in this case. This cause of action is framed to impose a direct responsibility upon the defendant for acts and omissions different from its vicarious liability for the acts of Sister Adams which were capable of heightening the nature of injury.  
       
      68  
      The claim for exemplary damages based upon this cause of action is postulated differently from that referrable to the claim for such damages referrable to trespass. Attention was drawn to the decision of the House of Lords in  
      Rookes v Barnard 
       1964 AC 1129 where one of the identified categories in which such damages might be awarded was described as oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional acts by government servants. Significant aspects of that decision have not been followed in Australia particularly relating to the limitation of categories in which exemplary damages might be awarded (see  
      Uren 
      ) but therefore, so the argument ran, so much more emphatic would be the call to award such damages where there was conduct fitting the above description by government servants.  
       
      69  
      Although the remarks were provoked by reference to debate about whether trespass could be committed negligently and noting that in the instant case the question arose of an intentional wrong being committed by inadvertence, in the joint judgment in  
      Gray 
       their Honours recorded these observations which are pertinent: 
       
       “[22] ……..For present purposes it is enough to note two things. First, exemplary damages could not properly be awarded in a case of alleged negligence in which there was no conscious wrongdoing by the defendant. Ordinarily, then, questions of exemplary damages will not arise in most negligence cases be they motor accident or other kinds of case. But there can be cases, framed in negligence, in which the defendant can be shown to have acted consciously in contumelious disregard of the rights of the plaintiff or persons in the position of the plaintiff. Cases of an employer’s failure to provide a safe system of work for employees in which it is demonstrated that the employer, well knowing of an extreme danger thus created, persisted in employing the unsafe system might, perhaps, be of that latter kind. No doubt other examples can be found.” 
       
      70  
      The second matter adverted to by their Honours was the circumstance that in  
      Gray 
       the action was pleaded in negligence but appeared to have been conducted at trial by all concerned as an action in trespass.  
       
      71  
      The plaintiff again faces the obstacle on this issue that the asserted negligence of the defendant was inconsequential without the causative acts of assault by Sister Adams for which she has been dealt with under the criminal law. Arguing that the principles discussed in  
      Gray 
       presented no barrier to recovery of exemplary damages counsel for the plaintiff contended that the evidence showed a contumelious disregard by the defendant for the rights of the plaintiff in several respects. A vigorous attack was launched against Mr Boyle who was, effectively, the chief executive on site at Strathallen. It was said that his lack of knowledge was “breathtaking”. In cross examination he conceded that he was unaware of some nominated reports described later in submissions by counsel as major inquiries identifying the risk of abuse and the need for systems to be put in place to detect and avoid it. Included, for example, was a review of standards of patient care in 5th Schedule Hospitals dated 1987 by a ministerial advisory committee chaired by Ms Merilyn Walton the manager of the complaints unit within the Department of Health. Although the document is now no doubt in public domain (Exhibit NN has a State Library catalogue number imprinted on it) it is a matter of speculation whether it was circulated to Mr Boyle. The title of the committee suggests that any report would be directed to the minister and no doubt distribution thereafter would be at the minister’s discretion and direction.  
       
      72  
      It was argued to be relevant that the defendant through Mr Boyle failed to report Sister Adams’ conduct to police and failed to forward information about it to the Nurses Registration Board until urged by Mrs McDonald so to do. Mention was made of the absence of thanks by way of acknowledgment to those who did complain and the apparent absence of inquiry into the failure of Mr Mills to react to complaint. I have elsewhere canvassed the reasonableness of requiring complaint in writing before reacting or acting. The accumulation of these and other matters which it is unnecessary to tabulate was said to create a situation which ought to be gauged against the circumstances that “no change was instituted of a sort that would rectify the gross and known deficiencies which had demonstrably permitted a horrendous situation to develop concerning Sister Adams.”  
       
      73  
      The evidence does not justify that language. The assaults were despicable by reason of the helplessness of the victim but the delay in detecting what had happened and removing the perpetrator represented a system failure rather than oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional acts by goverment servants. There can be no reasonable complaint about response once the matters were drawn to attention. Leaving aside the approaches said to have been made to Mr Mills, Sister Adams had been removed from cottage 5 within about a week of the matter being raised. Even if one took a time span from the approaches to Mr Mills it extends to about two weeks. I reject the claim for exemplary damages.  
       
      74  
      In support of submissions counsel for the plaintiff handed up a document headed “Particulars of Exemplary Damages”. I have not dealt seriatim with the thirty six various expressions paragraphed therein. Neither individually nor cumulatively do I find that the contentions support an award of exemplary damages.  
       
      75  
      I will refer the final ingredient of damage claimed for convenience as “voluntary care”. A calculation was submitted manifesting the cost of provision of care at commercial rates for the plaintiff for 24 hours per day carers between August 1990 when he was withdrawn from Strathallen until October 1996 when he entered the St John of God Hospice at Goulburn from where he transferred to his current residence. During that span the plaintiff was cared for by Mrs McDonald with assistance from other family, principally Mrs Hogan. There were periods of respite in fact at Strathallen but it was stated, without demur on behalf of the defendant that the rates were such that arithmetical discounts would produce no significant variation to the quantum of claim which was for many hundreds of thousands of dollars.  
       
      76  
      A fundamental determination must be made of the reasons for (and the reasonableness) of the removal of the plaintiff from Strathallen in August 1990 which was more than six months after he could possibly be at any risk from assault by Sister Adams. The decision for removal was made by Mrs McDonald. As abovementioned, it appears that she had formed the impression that there were no more than two charges of assault to be brought against the offender although I am not satisfied that information in those terms, that the charges were limited to two, was conveyed to her by any representative of the defendant. I accept that she had come to believe this although it is not clear why the number of assaults, as distinct from the nature and quality of actions constituting any assault, should have been regarded by her as of over-arching importance. The trigger for removal of the plaintiff from Strathallen seems to have been information from Ms Meredith on the occasion of her visit. Mrs McDonald gave this evidence: 
       
       “Q. At some point in time you took Timothy out of Strathallen? 
       
        A. Yes, that’s right. 
        
        Q. When was that? 
        
        A. Would have been very shortly after Jo Meredith came and told me the charge. I couldn’t believe it and I took him out but I can’t remember exactly. 
        
        Q. And you are refer to the conversation you told the court about before the adjournment? 
        
        A. Yes, that’s right. 
        
        Q. That occurred, as you believe, in or about August of 1990? 
        
        A. Mmm. 
        
        Q. Why did you take him out then? 
        
        A. Well, I was only told, I was always under the impression that was only two charges and that’s all I had been told and when I was told I found it so unbelievable that anybody could do anything like that and I was upset for Timothy. I thought why should anybody do anything like that when we have never hurt him and I just thought it was unfair. 
        
        Q. Up until that point when you got this information from Miss Meredith how significant did you think the assaults had been based on what you had been told by – 
        
        A. I was told there was only the two and that’s all I believed and I just, I was told I just had to wait and that’s what I did and I was never told anything and I never asked because I was told I wasn’t to and I just let it go and when this all came out it was a shock.” 
       
      77  
      And in cross examination she responded: 
       
       “Q. Now in August 1990 you decided to take him out of Strathallen as a full-time person? 
       
        A. That’s true. 
        
        Q. You spoke with Mr Livermore about that, did you not, about that decision? 
        
        A. No I probably told him. 
        
        Q. You told Mr Livermore all right, did Mr Livermore give you any advice? 
        
        A. I can’t remember. 
        
        Q. Did Mr Livermore suggest to you that you should leave him in Strathallen? 
        
        A. I can’t remember sir. 
        
        Q. Did Mr Livermore say to you something along the lines or reassure you about his safety? 
        
        A. I can’t remember that he might have done, I can’t remember.”

      And: 
       
       “Q. You didn’t speak to anybody at Strathallen before you took him out? 
       
        A. If I had spoken to somebody it would have been Mr Livermore, I must have said I want to take him home. 
        
        Q. You didn’t take any advice or counsel?

        Q. Did you ask Mr Livermore whether he could give yo some advice? 
        
        A. We had talks but he didn’t give me advice that much. 
        
        Q. He didn’t give you advice that much? 
        
        A. It was only in talking, I didn’t know there was any services I could get. 
        
        Q. What about from Mr Livermore, he spent quite a lot of time with you at that stage?

      Mrs McDonald had noticed no change in the plaintiff between February (by which time Sister Adams had left) and August when he was removed by her. In answer to express question she said she thought he was the same (transcript p 172 l 27). 
       
      81  
      Whilst the view of Gibbs J (as he then was ) expounded in  
      Griffiths v Kerkemeyer 
       1976-7 139 CLR 161 @ 165 that damages of the species now under discussion are payable to a plaintiff only to the extent that the need was or may be productive of financial loss was not followed in  
      Van Gervan v Fenton 
       1992 175 CLR 323 and thus his proposition of two stage approach, first is it reasonably necessary to provide the services and second, would it be reasonably necessary to do so at cost is disapproved, it is disapproved only to the extent of the second stage question. It remains essential for the plaintiff to show that the services received were to fulfil a tort induced need:  
      Nguyen v Nguyen 
       1990 169 CLR 245.  
       
      82  
      Absent tort, the plaintiff would have received care at Strathallen. I find the evidence establishes that the removal from there was not for the purpose of fulfilling any tort induced need but was the consequence of a choice by Mrs McDonald inspired by her upset and anger and it follows that the notional incurring of costs for voluntary services was not relevantly caused by breach of duty by the defendant: cf  
      CES v Superclinics (Aust) Pty Limited 
       1995 38 NSWLR 47 @ 84D. 
       
      83  
      Counsel referred me to  
      Johnston v G.I.O. 
       Unreported Finlay J 2 Dec 1993. I do not regard the award of damages for the added cost of caring for a disabled child born to a tortiously brain damaged claimant as providing a precedential imperative for the damages claimed in this aspect of this case. 
       
      84  
      Accordingly I find the plaintiff is entitled to damages of $53,333. The plaintiff is himself, of course, oblivious to this litigation. He was not however, as the evidence shows, insensitive to the feelings of pain and discomfort and he is not disentitled to damages as if he were insensible: contrast  
      Skelton v Collins 
       1996 115 CLR 94. The circumstance that he has no memory of the tortious occurrences (as I find to be the case) does not operate to reduce the damages: cf  
      Del Ponti v Del Ponti 
       1987 11 NSWLR 498. I recognize as Kirby P (as he then was) discussed @ p 503 et seq that the treatment of damages in this category has not been wholly satisfactory but given the circumstances of this case I do not perceive entry of judgment for the plaintiff as I have proposed as being other than just between the parties.  
       
      85  
      There are outstanding issues including interest and the cost of administering investment of the verdict, possible application for payment out and the question of costs. I indicated at the conclusion of the hearing that liberty to apply would be granted in respect of outstanding matters and I so order.  
       
      86  
      Subject to the foregoing I set the amount of the plaintiff’s damages at $53,333 as stated and I will fix a date for dealing with ancillary questions and the formal entry of judgment.

     REGINA v LOUIS BAYEH 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1 GROVE J : This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by Stewart ADCJ following the conviction of the applicant upon a single count of attempting to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 319 of the Crimes Act. Sentence was imposed on 14 November 1997 and consisted of a total of four years penal servitude divided into minimum and additional term components of two years each, the minimum term commencing on 4 July 1997 and expiring on 3 July 1999. 2 The offence had its origins in an event on 4 January 1990 outside the home of the applicant when a handgun was discharged in the direction of a young man. The applicant was charged in respect of this. He was committed for trial from Local Court to the Parramatta District Court. Ten days before the scheduled trial date he made an application to vacate the trial date and for the grant of commission to take evidence overseas from an intended witness. In support of those applications he swore an affidavit annexing a statement purportedly signed by one Bazzi admitting that it was Bazzi and not the applicant who had fired the weapon. Investigations showed that Bazzi was not in Australia on 4 January 1990. The application to take evidence on commission was withdrawn and the applicant pleaded guilty to the firearm offence on 30 September 1993. 3 The falsity of the material contained in the affidavit in support of the application to vacate the trial date and take evidence on commission was the basis of the present charge. Upon arraignment the applicant pleaded not guilty and the trial proceeded before Stewart ADCJ and a jury. At the conclusion of the Crown case the applicant’s then counsel made an application that a verdict of acquittal be directed. That motion failed. An adjournment was then sought so that further instructions could be sought from the applicant by his legal advisers. Upon resumption the Court was informed that the applicant wished to plead guilty. The jury was returned to Court and the applicant pleaded guilty upon re-arraignment in their presence. The jury found the applicant guilty in accordance with this plea.4 The applicant was remanded in custody upon conviction on 4 July 1997 but the sentencing proceedings were prolonged substantially to enable the applicant to advance matters which he sought to rely upon in mitigation of sentence. These included matters of assistance to authorities along the lines for which “discounts” from sentence might be obtained: Crimes Act s 442B; R v Cartwright 1989 17 NSWLR 243; R v Gallagher 1991 23 NSWLR 220.5 In his remarks on sentence on 14 November Stewart ADCJ included these observations: “It is clear that the prisoner cunningly organised this conspiracy himself, albeit with the acquiescence of Bazzi; but the prisoner made a fatal mistake. Bazzi could not have committed the crime or have had anything to do with it. He could not have been present when the crime was committed as was falsely sworn and could not have done what he said he did, because on the night the hand gun was fired by Bayeh, Bazzi was in Lebanon. That this is so is without doubt. Department of Immigration records including documents in Bazzi’s own handwriting clearly shows he left Australia on 6 December 1989 and did not return until 17 January 1990. 
     
      
       
        When these facts are analysed it is easily discernible that this is no spur of the moment or haphazard crime. Every step of the way was planned. It was an on-going attempt to pervert the course of justice and work the system to the prisoner’s advantage; but this time unfortunately for the prisoner the system itself worked, and to his disadvantage.” 
       
      
    6 It was not suggested that those remarks by his Honour were unjustified.7 The application for leave to appeal against sentence was listed for hearing in this Court on Friday 3 April 1998 which, it can be observed, is a little over three months after the conclusion of the sentencing proceedings. That hearing date was vacated by the Registrar on the motion of the applicant in order to permit, it appears, the collation and presentation of assertedly relevant material to justify further “discount” by reason of assistance to authority of which the sentencing judge had not been made aware. The application was relisted before this Court (differently constituted) on Friday 29 May 1998. In connection with that scheduled hearing affidavits were filed by the applicant and others evidencing that the applicant had not told his then legal representatives of his approaches to the New South Wales Crime Commission or the Independent Commission Against Corruption. He has explained that upon making those approaches he was advised that he should maintain secrecy. At the hearing on 29 May it appeared to the Court that there had been developments since the applicant appeared for sentence and there was produced to the Court a letter of that date from the Independent Commission Against Corruption which concluded with the paragraph: “The Commission has not yet completed its investigation nor prepared a report pursuant to s 74 of the Act in relation to the investigation and as such the Commission is unable to comment on (the applicant’s) allegations at this stage.”8 Thereupon senior counsel then appearing for the applicant sought further adjournment. The Crown did not oppose that application. 9 The matter was relisted before this Court (coincidentally constituted as at present) on Friday 18 September 1998. The foreshadowed report by the Independent Commission Against Corruption had not been made. The applicant through senior counsel again applied for an adjournment. This was opposed by the Crown. The adjournment was granted for reasons then given which it is unnecessary to repeat in entirety. 10 On that occasion the observation was made that “in essence, the applicant wishes to claim that assistance that he has given to law enforcement bodies about which the sentencing judge was not informed, alternatively, was not fully informed, has been such that he is entitled to some reduction of sentence. Important amongst the matters which the applicant wishes to ventilate is assistance which he claims to have given to an inquiry presently being conducted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption”. 11 The application was relisted before this Court on Monday 12 April 1999. Under cover of a letter dated 17 December 1998 the Independent Commission Against Corruption sent to the Registrar of this Court a letter accompanied by an extract of a chapter in a report by a commissioner relating to investigations into allegations made by the applicant concerning a Member of Parliament. The letter stated that there was a recommendation that the content of the report be drawn to the attention of this Court in circumstances where the Commission had previously provided a letter referring to the applicant having provided information to the Commission. That letter is obviously the one referred to the Court on 29 May 1998. 12 It should be recorded that neither senior counsel for the applicant today (who did not appear when the matter was before the Court in May and September last) nor the Crown Prosecutor sought to tender or otherwise put before the Court the content of the chapter which had been forwarded to the Registrar. 13 As is apparent from the foregoing record, the substantial delay in the matter coming on for hearing is a result of the applicant’s own motions for adjournment. 14 No written submissions supplementary to those filed in respect of the scheduled hearing for 3 April 1998 were presented and senior counsel adopted those advanced by his predecessor in several respects. Extracted from those submissions the following grounds were relied upon in each instance asserting that the sentencing judge fell into error by: 
     
      
       
       (iii) Giving undue weight to his criticism of good character references which were not relied upon by the applicant in the proceedings; 
        
       (iv) Giving insufficient weight to sentencing statistics issued by the Judicial Commission. 
        
       (v) Giving undue weight to the applicant’s past life style and character as evidenced by transcript from the Wood Royal Commission. 
        
       (vii) Giving insufficient weight to the applicant’s assistance to the authorities, 
        
       and in the event that the Court came to resentence: 
        
       (vi) Giving insufficient weight to the applicant’s medical condition. 
        
       Other numbered grounds were not pressed. 
       
      
    15 The first matter raised on behalf of the applicant concerned sentencing statistics. In his remarks on sentence Stewart ADCJ had observed: “I am of the view that what was said by Badgery-Parker J in Taouk’s case, about sentencing trends and patterns is still the case. No sentencing pattern in these cases has yet emerged. I say this in the light of statistics on sentence from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales 1996 for both perverting the course of justice and attempting to do so.  
     
      
       
        These statistics indicate what percentage of prisoners were sent to prison, what percentage were given recognizances under s 558 of the Crimes Act and so forth, but without knowing the facts both objective and subjective in the cases themselves mentioned in the statistics, I do not find this raw data to be of great assistance in the sentencing process.” 
       
      
    16 The challenge to this observation was sought to be supported by some remarks of Levine J in R v Karageorge CCA Unreported 17 July 1998 where his Honour had said (although the decision of the Court was to quash the conviction and send the matter back for a new trial and not to intervene on sentence) that “……….. the passage of time from the decision in Taouk has permitted the gathering of data that in some way can be of useful reference.” Thereafter his Honour recorded some imprisonment, percentage, case numbers and other statistics. He went on to hypothesize what he would have regarded as an appropriate sentence in the appeal then under consideration.17 It needs to be observed that what Levine J postulated was that there were some data that could be of useful reference in some way. His Honour by no means suggested that there was a definitive gathering of material either for obligation or guidance of sentencing judges. No doubt the gathering of data does provide a resource for more useful guidance than its absence but his Honour’s remarks do not demonstrate that Stewart ADCJ fell into error. An attempt was made to elaborate the raw data by extracting some detail of the cases upon which the Judicial Commission statistics had been based. It is not necessary to recite the material that was collated and handed to the Court and it suffices to say that the differences, which might readily be expected between circumstances of offence and offender, are such that they do not in my view lead to any conclusion that the assessment reached in the exercise of discretion by Stewart ADCJ is tainted by error.18 The next matter argued on behalf of the applicant involved reference to testimonials which were sought to be categorized as “not relied upon” in the proceedings. These testimonials were in evidence before his Honour having been tendered as exhibits in the Crown case in the trial. It is accurate that they were not specifically tendered by the applicant to be relied upon in the sentencing proceedings. Nevertheless, they were before his Honour and there was no legal impediment to his making use of them. His Honour made observations which indicated that he regarded these glowing testimonials as unreliable and it was not suggested that he could not so find given the state of the evidence. In respect of one of them Stewart ADCJ remarked that the reference was really “of little assistance” to him as the sentencing judge. It is plain that his Honour did not use these testimonials to enhance the culpability of the applicant or to increase his sentence. His remarks show that, in the possibly mistaken impression that the applicant might have wished to rely upon these fulsome testimonials, he did not accept them as providing a basis for mitigating sentence. Nothing in his Honour’s dealings with these references gives rise to intervention by this Court.19 In the remarks on sentence reference was made to the applicant’s prior life style. It was said that the applicant worked for a number of years as a doorman at clubs and discos and his Honour commented that that description was euphemistic and that whilst he worked for a number of years as a doorman at such establishments “it went a lot further than that”. Complaint was therefore made that his Honour was essentially taking into account material which led him to take an inappropriately cynical view of the applicant. That approach is said to be particularly evident in the transcript of proceedings held in camera at the request of the applicant and by consent of the Crown. The reason for this related to matters which were then of current confidentiality and no criticism of the procedure adopted was made. His Honour’s knowledge of these matters of the applicant’s background was extracted from a reading of certain transcript of evidence given by the applicant in the Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service by Wood J (as he then was). The purpose of inviting Stewart ADCJ to read this material was to support the applicant’s claim for “discount” for assistance to authorities. It was said without challenge that that evidence was given in the light of the knowledge that s 17 of the Royal Commissions Act 1923 applied. It provides: “17 (2) An answer made, or document or other thing produced by a witness to or before the commission shall not, except as otherwise provided in this section, be admissible in evidence against that person in any civil or criminal proceedings.”20 The exceptions scheduled in s17(3) are not applicable.21 Counsel referred to Hartmann v Commissioner of Police 1997 91 A Crim R 141 which was a case essentially dealing with the scope of s 17(2) to include disciplinary proceedings before the Government and Related Employees Appeal Tribunal. In such a tribunal proceedings although disciplinary in nature are manifestly brought “against” a respondent. 22 In the present case no tender of the answers given by the applicant (evidenced by the transcript) was made “against the applicant”. His own counsel tendered the transcript. The argument advanced was that in those circumstances the presiding judge was limited to using the material for the purpose of the applicant and that it was erroneous for him to rely on it for any other purpose. In short, as I understood the submission, although the material was notionally tendered as a result of the invitation by senior counsel for the applicant to the presiding judge to read that material, he could only use the content to support the claim for discount of sentence and could not use it for the purpose of making an assessment of the background of the applicant. 23 This argument effectively raised a point of principle and the Court constituted pursuant to s 6AA of the Criminal Appeal Act is unsuitable for the resolution of a disputed issue of general principle. I recognize that the words of prohibition in the statute are “admissible in evidence against” and not “tendered against”. It is, I apprehend, somewhat unusual for any litigant to place before a court material which is expressly inadmissible against that litigant but if it is chosen to tender such material then we were referred to no authority for the proposition that that litigant could impose restrictions upon its use. The argument of restricted utility now advanced was not foreshadowed by any specific reference in written submissions or otherwise. The Court raised the absence with senior counsel. It was recognized that, as a result of the adjournments which the applicant had sought, the minimum term component of his sentence is scheduled to expire in less than three months time. The applicant through senior counsel indicated that he did not wish further adjournment of the appeal to enable a full bench to be constituted unless bail was granted in the meantime. It would not be appropriate for the Court in effect to enter into negotiations as to the terms of adjournment. It was specified that the applicant expressly did not abandon the argument on this point and counsel was invited to continue his submissions to their conclusion. The situation is less than satisfactory, however this application has been adjourned for over a year and, despite the circumstance that that is a consequence of the applicant’s own doing, the impending expiry of the minimum term component of sentence should not be ignored. The balance of justice would be served by proceeding even though it would have been desirable that the Crown have an opportunity to consider this unforeshadowed issue. 24 I am unpersuaded that the mere fact that the material was before his Honour for one purpose intended by the applicant placed any restriction upon his Honour’s use of the material. Unless special rules apply, evidence generally which is before a tribunal is available for all legitimate purposes. Further I find that in the particular circumstances no breach of s 17(2) of the Royal Commissions Act 1923 is manifest and this Court should not intervene in respect of the use by Stewart ADCJ of the material that he was expressly invited to read.25 Once it is recognized that the material was available to be used by his Honour, there is abundant justification for his findings and observations about the applicant. In no way do they manifest any cynicism which I took to be an expression by counsel as a euphemism for bias or prejudice. I would reject this ground. 26 This brings me finally to the assertion concerning the weight to be given to the applicant’s assistance to authorities. As the record of adjournments which I have chronicled shows the multiple adjournments were sought in order to enable the applicant to rely upon material which he had given to the Independent Commission Against Corruption. In the event nothing was put before the Court in order to enable any assessment of whether any such information was either of value or not. So far as other matters of asserted assistance by the applicant, I see no error in the way in which they were assessed by the learned sentencing judge.27 As the criminality of the applicant which is manifest in the remarks which I have earlier recited demonstrates this was a serious offence within its category. The sentence was not, in my view manifestly excessive.28 I propose that application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal dismissed and sentence confirmed.29 KIRBY J: I agree with the order proposed and the reasons given for that order.

     REGINA v Patrick James STEPHENS 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1 SHELLER JA: On 22 June 1987 the appellant, Patrick James Stephens, pleaded guilty to a charge that on 18 December 1986 he murdered his wife, Sandiya Stephens, at Dungay near Murwillumbah. On 22 December 1987 McInerney J sentenced him to penal servitude for life to date from 4 January 1987, from which date the appellant had been continuously in custody. 2 In 1997 the appellant applied under s13A (2) of the Sentencing Act 1989 for determination of a minimum term and an additional term for the sentence imposed. McInerney J heard and, on 27 November 1997, granted the application which the Crown did not oppose. His Honour imposed a total sentence of penal servitude for twenty-two years comprising a minimum term of sixteen years to commence on 4 January 1987 and an additional term of six years, making the appellant eligible for parole on 4 January 2003. On 26 August 1998 the appellant applied for leave to appeal out of time on the ground that the re-determined sentence was excessive. Apart from delay the appellant had a right of appeal pursuant to s13A (12).3 The grounds of appeal were stated in the written submissions on behalf of the appellant to be: 
     
      
       
       1. That his Honour erred by finding that the appellant was unable to show any contrition for his act. 
        
       2. His Honour gave insufficient weight to the plea of guilty. 
        
       3. His Honour erred by failing to give sufficient weight to the appellant’s rehabilitation. 
        
       4. The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    4 Section 13A (9) provides that the Supreme Court, in exercising its functions under the section, is to have regard to, inter alia,  “(b) Any report on the person made by the Review Council and any other relevant reports prepared after sentence (including, for example, reports on the person’s rehabilitation), being in either case reports made available to the Supreme Court, and 
     
      
       
        (c) The need to preserve the safety of the community, and 
        
        (d) The age of the person (at the time the person committed the offence and also at the time the Supreme Court deals with the application), and may have regard to any other relevant matter.” 
       
      
    5 The appellant married the deceased, a Malaysian citizen, in Malaysia on 13 June 1980. After the marriage they lived together on his parents’ farm at Upper Dungay. The appellant worked with the Tweed Shire Council as a crane operator. His parents lived nearby but were often away. The deceased lived a lonely life on the farm.6 In April 1985 the appellant purchased a 250 gram bottle of cyanide from a chemist in Lismore for the ostensible purpose of poisoning dingoes. On 18 December 1986 there was still cyanide in the bottle which was kept in a shed on the property. In the evening on 18 December 1986 the appellant took an Orthoxicol capsule, unscrewed it and at least filled one half of the ampoule with cyanide taken from the bottle He used a plastic spoon to transfer the cyanide from the bottle into the ampoule. As there was some cyanide left on the spoon, he rinsed the spoon in a glass of water. He said that he then gave the capsule and the glass of water containing the residue of cyanide to the deceased because she was complaining of a headache.7 The appellant then left his wife to die and callously set about preparing dinner. Not unnaturally half an hour later he discovered his wife was dead. The appellant wrapped the deceased in a sheet and carried her out to the lawn. Shortly afterwards he buried her in the back yard adding lime from a bag of lime used for garden purposes before filling in the grave.8 The appellant recounted his first version of what happened on 18 December to his sister the next day. He told her the deceased had died suddenly in her sleep the previous night. He said he had gone to give her something to eat but she would not wake up. He said he was taking her to a mosque at Woolgoolga.9 A number of people made statements that the appellant showed no emotion when commenting about his wife’s death.10 When that evening his sister asked him why he did not tell anyone about the deceased’s death he said “I just couldn’t handle people yesterday.” He said he had not thought to ring triple 0. He said an autopsy had shown the deceased had died from natural causes. He said, “She had the flu and I gave her an Orthoxicol tablet”.11 The appellant adhered to this story when speaking to his parents and friends. He told his father he had sent an international telegram to the deceased’s parents. He did not telephone because it was necessary, so he said, to book a month beforehand.12 In fact, according to the statement of facts on 22 December 1986 (McInerney J said it was 3 January 1987), the appellant wrote to the deceased’s parents announcing her death. In his reasons for determination McInerney J said: “He informed them that the deceased had been sick for some months and that the doctor could not do anything more for her. He deliberately gave the impression in that letter that he was a loving husband who had done everything he could for his sick wife. He wrote further that when he knew she had died it was the most terrible feeling he had ever had. He wrote that the doctor said: ‘To put it simply, she went to sleep and switched off by turning out the lights’. 
     
      
       
        He said he had prepared her in her wedding sari and took her to a Buddhist temple at Woolgoolga. He said his wife would want him to pick up the pieces and carry on with a new life. He concluded in the letter, ‘You will be feeling very hurt but try to remember nobody knows better than you how you feel right now’. 
        
        The hypocrisy of these actions needs no elaboration.” 
       
      
    13 Through a friend in Australia, the deceased’s parents initiated inquiries and a police investigation resulted. On 4 January 1987 the appellant first spoke to the police. At first he adhered to his story. He said he had taken the deceased to see a Dr Beatty who looked at her and said that she had died of natural causes and that he had rung the undertaker at Tweed Heads and arranged for the body to be taken to the undertaker. McInerney J observed that this was a hopeless version of events.14 The appellant then changed his story. He said the deceased had complained her head was hurting. He examined her head and felt a lump but could not see any bleeding. He gave her an Orthoxicol tablet and prepared the evening meal. When he asked her to partake he noticed she was unconscious and cold. He then took her to the hospital where she was seen by a doctor who said she had died of natural causes. He said he could not understand why there were no records of this visit. He told police he had gone home and found the deceased’s wedding dress and with the permission of the nurse dressed the body in the dress.15 On 4 January 1987 the appellant was seen in a motor vehicle with a young woman. Asked about their relationship he said he had only known her for a couple of weeks and they were only friends. When confronted by the police with what the young woman had told them he said he had known her for longer than two weeks but denied he was having an affair with her. In fact, sexual intercourse had taken place on four occasions, the last time being 28 December 1986, ten days after the deceased’s death. Eventually, the appellant admitted that, because he realised the young woman would not go out with him if she knew he was married, he had told her his wife had died two years before.16 In his reasons for re-determination, McInerney J said: “When I sentenced the [appellant] I was satisfied that he had not admitted to the police that he was having a serious affair with the young lady in question; that he had lied to her about the deceased being dead; that the affair had become fairly serious; that he had had sexual relations with her; that he was in the habit of visiting her almost daily, and indeed spent weekends with her family; that he had led her to believe that he wanted to marry her; and that he in fact visited her on the night of his wife’s death and had dinner with her. She said she did not notice anything different about his demeanour that night. 
     
      
       
        The [appellant] continued to see the young lady daily over the Christmas period with the exception of Christmas Day. He visited her at her parents’ home on Boxing Day and took her back to his home on 2 January 1987. 
        
        I stated in my remarks on sentence: 
        
        ‘It is obvious without going into it [in] any further detail that he was in love with her and he knew if she became aware of his wife being alive she would have ceased the affair. 
        
         
          I am also satisfied that he attempted to downgrade his relationship with her when spoken to by the police because he fully realised the danger of revealing such a relationship on the motive of the killing. 
          
          When it became obvious later that day that the police were not accepting his version of events, he then changed his story again, stating he had panicked and buried her in a hole at the back of the house, believing he would be blamed for letting her die. Why he threw that lime in, he did not know, but later on he admitted that it would assist in the decomposition of the body. 
          
          He intimated that they had a normal marriage, a statement that he later vigorously denied and he admitted he did not find her wedding dress’.” 
         
        
       
      
    17 This last version was the appellant’s third version of events. In a record of interview on 5 January 1987, he gave a detailed description of what had happened. He said the deceased was cold when he first noticed her. He admitted he had sexual intimacy with the young woman and wanted her to think about a serious relationship. The police had found the cyanide bottle in the tool shed. The appellant said he bought the Orthoxicol on 12 December 1986 because he had had the flu. Further, he admitted that a few days before his wife died he went to the box where the cyanide was stored, removed it, unscrewed the lid and tightened it again. McInerney J regarded this admission as very significant and concluded that the appellant looked at the cyanide because he had in mind to poison his wife.18 A second record of interview was made on 7 January 1987. The appellant agreed he had told the police a pack of lies and said he wanted to tell the truth. The deceased had complained of a headache. The appellant thought it would be a good time to poison her. He changed the contents of the capsule in the shed with the spoon and took it back inside and gave the deceased the capsule and glass of water. Asked why he said: “I had to get her out of the road. At that time I didn’t know what to do because I had somebody else with whom I was very much in love.” He had been thinking about doing something to the deceased two to three days before, but not until the occasion when the deceased complained of a headache had he made up his mind to poison her. McInerney J had no doubt that the appellant was well aware of the extremely dangerous qualities of cyanide.19 At the hearing on sentence on 23 June 1987 at Lismore the appellant gave a fifth version of events. He said he did not know how strong the cyanide was. He tried to suggest he did not believe it was a deadly poison because he believed by the time he administered it, it would have deteriorated over time. McInerney J described this evidence as nonsense as was most of the evidence the appellant gave. The appellant said he believed the deceased had a knife hidden in the deep freeze and was going to attack him. He denied he intended to kill his wife. He made, what McInerney J regarded as a hypocritical statement, “If she was sick I would care for her and she would be more dependent on me”. A forty page statement written by the appellant was tendered. McInerney J described it as a self-serving document wherein the appellant tried to put the blame on the deceased for the problems in their marriage. He said he wanted children but that the deceased did not. However, the lay evidence called was to the effect that the deceased was keen to have children and was having medical treatment to overcome a problem. The appellant was critical of the deceased’s attitude towards him. He said she wanted a divorce, disliked him and had attacked him with a knife and that her parents were avaricious. The lay evidence was against his assertions. McInerney J was not prepared to accept anything he said unless his evidence was corroborated. His Honour observed that the appellant’s attempts to blame the deceased’s attitude towards him did him no credit at all.20 His Honour had no doubt the appellant gave the deceased poison intending to kill her. His Honour said: “When I sentenced the [appellant], I concluded that the motivation for poisoning his wife was to get her out of the road so that he could continue his relationship with the young lady. He pleaded guilty to murder on the basis of intent to cause grievous bodily harm or acting with reckless indifference. The Crown case was that he administered the poison with intent to kill. I have no doubt that the Crown’s contention was correct. I am satisfied that he gave the deceased the poison intending to kill her. 
     
      
       
        The facts of this case are horrible. There is nothing in the subjective features to mitigate the serious objective circumstances of this offence. The objective criminality is high. The main factors to be taken into account in sentencing are the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, and retribution. Those matters loom more importantly in determining an appropriate sentence than rehabilitation which of course is a matter to be taken into account.” 
       
      
    21 There could be no doubt, as McInerney J observed, that the crime required severe punishment.22 McInerney J then dealt with the subjective features of the case. The appellant had pleaded guilty to murder. In McInerney J’s view, his plea of guilty was no evidence of his contrition but rather a realisation of the inevitable. His Honour said “He is to be given no credit for his plea of guilty on the question of contrition.” However, the fact that the appellant saved the Crown the expense of a trial was a matter to be factored into the sentence though in the circumstances such factor was worthy only of minimal consideration. 23 A psychologist, Mr W John Taylor, interviewed the appellant before he was sentenced and in a report of 5 August 1987 stated that the appellant had a good deal of remorse for killing his wife. At the time McInerney J rejected that opinion, it being contrary to the facts as he understood them and he saw no reason to change his opinion.24 The appellant was born on 13 February 1957 and passed the School Certificate. He had a Senior First Aid Certificate and numerous licences for crane operation, joinery and rigging. These qualifications suggested he was a reasonably intelligent person. He had no prior convictions. Whilst in custody he had the following classifications: A2 - 10 February 1988; B - 3 June 1992; and C1 - 25 July 1994. On 2 February 1988, Mr Capes, a Probation and Parole Officer, reassessed the appellant as a shy, socially withdrawn man who killed the woman he loved “after suffering long term emotional pain and inner conflict resulting from his inability to bridge their increasing emotional distance, and his inability to deal with his intensive regressed anger at his wife’s dominance and belligerence.” Mr Capes recorded that the appellant was “guilt-ridden” but was open to counselling. He noted that he had renewed his interest in Christianity. McInerney J said:  “I cannot accept that assessment for obvious reasons. This is another example of a professional being hoodwinked by accepting the bland assertions of the person he is interviewing. It is trite to say that, of course, the only other person who could throw light on the matrimonial relationship is dead.”25 The appellant has had an excellent prison record and has been shown to be industrious and willing to learn. He has been interested in art and has produced excellent art work. He has done agricultural courses and achieved excellent results in a TAFE Computers A First Course. In an Education Statement, dated 15 April 1994, it was noted that the appellant wished to develop skills in computer graphics related to signwriting. He attended numeracy classes to further his skills and knowledge in mathematics and classes in Spanish studies. He completed a “tutor training” programme wherein he gained the skills to help other inmates to read and write. He has done considerable maintenance work in the Special Care Unit and has worked in the Maintenance Section as a leading hand carpenter. His carpentry work has been extensive and valuable.26 Mr Capes noted on 30 September 1988 that the appellant had built up a good rapport with regular visitors from prison fellowship and that he attended weekly Bible study courses with the Prison Chaplain. Mr Capes said the appellant was “beginning to cope with his guilt - not overwhelmed by it as when last interviewed in February 1988”.27 A Probation and Parole Officer, A Grapsas, noted on 9 October 1989 that the appellant continued to have difficulty coming to terms with his guilt. He had continued to receive visitors from the fellowship group.28 The appellant has established a significant relationship with a lady from the prison fellowship who began writing to him. She has two children from a previous relationship who are fond of the appellant. The situation is that they plan to marry some time after the appellant is released. He has informed her that he intends to involve himself in Church activities when he is released. She has said the appellant will receive practical and emotional support from the congregation of her Church. The appellant is now taking a Christian education course.29 The appellant is a model prisoner, polite, conscientious and hard-working and only requires minimal supervision. He has worked without supervision in the Maintenance Shop and in high security areas such as the gate house and the Governor’s office. He has also been given access to, and has worked without supervision in, restricted areas such as the Special Care, Lifestyles and Crisis Support Units.30 In 1994 he re-established ties and reconciled with his sister and his family, with whom he had not had contact since 1987.31 McInerney J said that it was to the appellant’s credit that all officers who had reported on him had universally referred to him as a model prisoner. “It appears, however, that the [appellant] is unable to show any contrition for his terrible act whereby he destroyed the life of his wife.”32 On the application for re-determination a clinical psychologist, Dr Walker, who had interviewed the appellant on three occasions and administered tests and prepared a report dated 18 October 1997, gave evidence. In her report she said: “Patrick Stephens has made very significant progress in prison, from a withdrawn, socially inept, immature and tormented young man to a calm and well-adjusted person studying Theology. Therapy received in prison has clearly been very effective, and Patrick’s enthusiastic involvement in education has been another important factor. His work history in prison has been excellent. 
     
      
       
        Patrick was able to concede to me that he would have been aware that he was killing his wife, but his memory is confused and he becomes very distressed when he tries to focus on it. He very much wants to have therapy sessions focusing on the death of his wife and on his intent to kill her; to date therapists have avoided the area because Patrick became so upset. I have agreed, with permission of Corrective Services and after discussion with Mr Zeinfeld, psychologist, to provide Patrick with therapy sessions to focus on his killing his wife. Although afraid, Patrick was eager for this. 
        
        In my opinion, Patrick will not constitute a risk to the community. With his well-developed work skills (both in building and crane-driving), he will fit into the normal world quickly. His group of Christian friends will be supportive and his Theology studies will give him another range of involvements in the community.” 
       
      
    33 McInerney J acknowledged Dr Walker’s impressive curriculum vitae and publications and summarised her report. He said that he could well understand there were cultural differences between the deceased and the appellant as the appellant had remarked to Dr Walker. Dr Walker had no doubt that the appellant had fallen in love with the young woman he met shortly before he killed his wife. When Dr Walker first interviewed the appellant he adhered to his story that he only intended to make his wife sick. His Honour had some doubt, however, about whether the appellant was a withdrawn, socially inept, immature and tormented young man. However, he did have many problems.34 Dr Walker gave oral evidence at the re-determination hearing. McInerney J said: “….that she believed that the appellant needed to be able to talk more about his wife’s death, and, as I understand it, face up to what he did. She believes that none of the specific mechanisms of the crime have been addressed by him. During her conversations with him about his wife’s death he became visibly upset which she believed was genuine.  
     
      
       
        Dr Walker said the [appellant] could still not remember clearly and that he needed to work through it with somebody. She said he was still very frightened to think about it by himself. He was coping, she said, by shutting things out. 
        
        He told Dr Walker that he had found it difficult to cope with issues relating to his wife’s death. When reading my remarks on sentence, he became so upset that he simply physically could not go on reading the document. Dr Walker, however, believes that the [appellant] will come to terms with what he has done in months, not years. This is certainly an optimistic view. Whether it will eventually prove to be correct is a matter of some speculation, despite Dr Walker’s belief. 
        
        Dr Walker had to concede in cross-examination that in her second interview with the [appellant] he said he could not remember intending to kill his wife but he expressed considerable shame. Dr Walker believed the [appellant] had become quite remorseful and that he was not just feeling sorry for himself because of his predicament in gaol. Dr Walker concluded the [appellant] was a much more mature person. She believes he now has the mechanisms to overcome similar problems should they occur in the future.” 
       
      
    35 McInerney J expressly and clearly recognised the balance to be made by a sentencing judge between, on the one hand, the demand for retribution for the horrible crime which was committed and for an appropriate sentence to deter others who might be like minded and, on the other, the blameless and useful life led by the perpetrator, a somewhat socially inept person, up to the time of the commission of the offence. The deceased was a young woman who had her life forfeited by a lonely terrible death in a strange land from a crime motivated by the appellant’s desire to rid himself of his wife so that he could continue his relationship with a young woman, circumstances that called for a severe penalty. His Honour said: “The [appellant] has made giant strides towards his rehabilitation but has yet to face up to the fact that he committed this terrible crime.”36 In his careful and persuasive submissions, Mr Boulten, who appeared for the appellant, emphasised that the appellant’s rehabilitation was not a matter of speculation but a fact demonstrated by his behaviour and positive activities for the twelve years since he was first imprisoned. Mr Boulten stressed the evidence appearing throughout many reports prepared about him of his remorse and feelings of guilt. He submitted that McInerney J erred in failing to give sufficient weight to these matters.37 It is important on an appeal such as this to repeat that the Court’s intervention depends upon a demonstration of error by the sentencing judge. Mr Boulten submitted that the sentence imposed, when compared with other sentences imposed for like offences, is excessive to the point of demonstrating error in itself.38 In my opinion, there is no basis upon which it can be said that McInerney J failed to take account of the appellant’s demonstrated rehabilitation. Moreover, I do not think that his Honour’s conclusion that the appellant had yet to face up to the fact that he committed this terrible crime can be gainsaid. The appellant did not give evidence on the re-determination hearing. He was the person best able to give evidence of a recognition that deliberately and cold-bloodedly and for the purpose of pursuing his relationship with another woman he planned and carried out the killing of his wife by poisoning. Having administered the poison he left his wife to die while he went to cook a meal. When he returned she was dead. It is unnecessary to pile epithet upon epithet to express the seriousness of this crime. At the time of sentence the appellant was content to suggest that the act was merely one of recklessness, part of a plan to make his wife feel sick, and to lay the blame for the problems of the marriage on the deceased. 39 On the re-determination the appellant had the opportunity, himself, to explain his change of attitude. He did not give evidence. Accordingly, it is open to conclude that his evidence would not have assisted his case and to draw more confidently the inference that McInerney J drew from the material before him that the appellant had yet to face up to the gravity of the crime he had committed.40 Mr Boulten submitted that McInerney J should have given greater weight to the plea of guilty. Even without the appellant’s full confession during the interview on 7 January 1987, the known facts were that he had buried his wife’s body in the back yard and covered it with lime, that a post-mortem showed traces of cyanide in the deceased’s organs and in the vicinity of her body when found, that a bottle containing cyanide was in the shed, that the last person to see the deceased alive was the appellant, that he had lied about the circumstances surrounding her death, and that the fulfilment of his relationship with another woman depended upon his getting rid of the deceased. I have no difficulty in accepting McInerney J’s conclusion that the plea of guilty was no more than a realisation of the inevitable. Mr Boulten submitted that in 1987 most people charged with murder pleaded not guilty however strong the case. His Honour factored in the utilitarian value of the plea but regarded it as worthy only of minimal consideration. There was no error in this view.41 Mr Boulten relied upon sentence statistics. To my mind, these do not demonstrate that the sentence imposed in this case was outside the appropriate range so as itself to be demonstrative of error. 42 In my opinion, the appellant has failed to show any error in the re-determination.43 No material was put before the Court in support of the application for leave to appeal and to explain the delay of many months in making it. However, the Crown gave no more than token opposition to this application and I would grant leave. I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
       1. Leave to the appellant, Patrick James Stephens, to appeal out of time; 
        
       2. Appeal dismissed.

     REGINA v JONATHAN PAUL MUIR 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
      
    1 GROVE J: The applicant in these proceedings appeared before Cantrill ADCJ in the Albury District Court on 17 August 1998 where he pleaded guilty to seven counts of breaking entering and stealing and one count of breaking and entering with intent. On that day he was remanded for sentence and released on conditional bail. Later he appeared before a Magistrate where he pleaded guilty to a further offence of breaking entering and stealing committed on 17 August 1998, that is to say on the date of his appearance in the Albury District Court. Ultimately his Honour sentenced the applicant to an effective sentence comprising a minimum term of four years penal servitude with an additional term of sixteen months. In imposing that sentence his Honour also dealt with, pursuant to s 51A of the Justices Act, the offence committed on 17 August 1998. It has to be said that the penalty is, on the face of it, quite severe. The applicant has appeared for himself in these proceedings.2 He has previously submitted some written submissions in response to the Registrar's direction and has today handed up a further document elaborating upon those matters.3 He draws attention to the circumstance that at the time of the offences he was, to use his words, ""under the influence of heroin and sleeping pills"". This was a circumstance that was drawn to the sentencing Judge's attention. Addiction per se is not a mitigating factor for offences such as these.4 A principal matter which the applicant mentions in his letter and in oral address to the Court is that his girlfriend has had a child and that he realises that he is going to be separated from his son during the early years of life. He indicates that he has become more sensitive to his responsibilities as a result of that circumstance.5 Regrettably the applicant's history to date has not shown any indications of real appreciation of responsibility. The multiple counts which I mentioned involved offences which were committed on 1 and 2 April 1998 respectively. I mention those dates because on 8 April 1998 the applicant appeared at the Wodonga Magistrate's Court where he was dealt with for offences including burglary, theft, handling stolen goods and attempting to obtain property by deception. On this occasion he was given sentences of eighteen months to be served concurrently and by way of an intensive correction order. This is a sentencing option in the State of Victoria which involves a form of probation. As I have mentioned, two of the offences in the indictment were committed about a week prior to the appearance in the Wodonga Magistrate's Court. The subsequent offences were on the 17th of that month, the 28th of that month and the 4th, 7th and 12th of the succeeding month. So it can be seen that despite the considerable lenience which is apparent in the sentence imposed in the Wodonga Magistrate's Court the applicant's choice to continue committing offences remained unabated.6 The monetary loss to the various victims in these offences was substantial and submissions from the Crown indicate a total property value of approximately $114,000, most of which has not been recovered. There is also a communication in the Crown's submissions drawing attention to material before the sentencing Judge and the effect upon some victims indeed the requirement that the children of one of them undergo counselling.7 In the written submissions today the applicant has mentioned the matters to which I have already made reference and concludes by asserting that his sentence was heavier than those who have committed more serious crime.8 The question of comparison is something that always has to be seen in the context not only of the crimes but of the particular offender. For that reason I have related some of the history of the applicant's pattern of offending.9 The applicant has a footnote to the written submissions in which he makes reference to the cases of R v. Peres-Vargas and R v. Gudgeon. The issue of parity of sentence between co-offenders is one with which this Court frequently deals. It should be observed, as was noted by the sentencing Judge, that the co-offender of the applicant was a juvenile said by the sentencing Judge to have been aged seventeen years in August 1998 when the applicant appeared for sentence. That discrepancy in age is of significance when one looks at comparative sentences.10 The final paragraph in the submission makes reference to the circumstances of the applicant's present custody. That is not a matter which is germane to the issue of whether or not there is error in the sentence provoking the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court.11 As I have said, this sentence itself is, on the face of it, quite severe. The applicant is a comparatively young man; on the other hand he is not juvenile. His record is longer than simply including the matters at Wodonga Magistrate's Court to which I have made more extensive reference. The sentence imposed was within the range of the sound exercise of discretion and no error in approach or principle is manifest in his Honour's remarks. In those circumstances whilst I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal.12 KIRBY J: I agree.13 GROVE J: The order of the Court therefore is application for leave to appeal granted but appeal dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application by Stephen Arthur Maiden for re-determination under s 13A Sentencing Act 1987 of the life sentence imposed on him by Hunt J at Grafton on 22 September 1988 following his conviction for the murder of Mark Gerald White at Glenreagh in November of 1987. The Crown neither supports nor opposes the application. 2 The Crown case at the trial was that the applicant and one Leslie Davidson Petty, who were both escaped convicts on a spree of criminal activity from Adelaide through Sydney to the Queensland border, lured the victim, a young seventeen year old who had been hitchhiking and whom they had picked up, into the bush and there killed him by breaking his neck and buried his body in a shallow grave. The Crown alleged that there was a prior agreement between them to kill the victim and that on a given signal from Petty, the applicant attacked the victim and during the ensuing struggle they fell to the ground where the applicant had the victim's neck in a head lock, and by pushing very hard and quickly against the side of his face attempted to break his neck, but succeeded only in rendering him unconscious, whereupon Petty came over, turned the victim onto his stomach before grabbing him under the chin and putting his knees into the victim's back, thus breaking his neck from the rear. 3 In a Record of Interview made on 16 February 1988, following his arrest, the applicant said that he merely pushed the victim over and went and dug the grave whilst Petty killed him (answer 14) and the motive for the killing was that they were concerned he would get in the way of a truck which they were supposed to ""rip off"" in Queensland (answer 68). 4 In his evidence on this application he said that he and Petty were intending to stop and rob a truck carrying a large quantity of cigarettes from Queensland to Sydney, and the victim was aware of this proposal and had agreed to be involved in the crime, but that Petty later suggested that he felt the victim should be killed because he believed that he would go to the police or inform the authorities that he and the applicant were in the area and had escaped from gaol; and the applicant agreed to the plan because at the time he regarded Petty as a type of father figure and, as a criminal, he looked up to him. 5 He said that when Petty gave him the signal he pushed the victim over, and the latter fell over on his back, Petty then sat on his stomach and held his hands round his throat, whilst the applicant ran into the bush, and when he came back, Petty had the victim on his stomach, he thought he was unconscious at the time and he saw Petty break his neck, whereupon Petty told him to go and dig a shallow grave, which he did. 6 Petty and the applicant told quite a different story at the trial in unsworn statements which the jury by their verdicts clearly rejected and which the learned trial judge described as ""a tissue of lies"". In the absence of other witnesses, it is difficult to tell how much of the version now given by the applicant is true, and precisely what part he physically played in carrying out the agreement between him and Petty to kill the deceased. However, what is clear beyond reasonable doubt is that there was an agreement between them that the victim should be killed for no good reason. On any version he was part of the agreement and on any version he gave the deceased the initial push preparatory to Petty breaking his neck, and whether he himself first tried to break the deceased's neck is not of any great significance. It was therefore a deliberate, callous, premeditated killing of a young man the killers had given a lift to, befriended and invited to join them in a proposed serious criminal enterprise. They then, so the applicant says, brutally killed him by breaking his neck because he knew about them and their plans and they feared he might notify the police. I accept that the applicant was not the instigator of the offence and was at the time under the influence of a considerably older man. 7 The applicant was born on 24 June 1966 in Melbourne and so was twenty one years old at the time of the murder. At the age of three or four he was placed in an institution along with two of his brothers, and he remained in institutional care until his mid teens when he was briefly re-united with his mother but shortly afterwards he was made a state ward. From the age of fifteen he had a number of convictions mainly in Victoria for offences such as theft, burglary, stealing motor cars, possess house breaking implements and escape from a youth training centre. He served a number of short sentences and ultimately in the District Court at Goulburn on 4 June 1987 he was sentenced to a total of four years penal servitude with a non-parole period of two years for break, enter and steal and forgery. It was whilst serving this sentence at Cooma that he and Petty escaped on 10 October 1987. 8 They travelled to South Australia where they remained for several weeks and then, with two others as travelling companions, they left Adelaide in a stolen motor vehicle on 21 November and drove through Northern Victoria to Sydney, and they then travelled north to Coff's Harbour, on the way picking up the deceased and a young female companion on the Pacific Highway near Macksville. After going to Coff's Harbour, they headed for Grafton via Glenreagh and it was at the latter place that the murder took place. The remainder of the group continued travelling, committing a number of offences on the way, until Petty and the applicant were ultimately arrested on 29 January 1998 near Yass and charged with escape from lawful custody. Subsequently, after being interviewed, both were charged with the murder on 16 February 1988, and made their first appearance on that charge at Goulburn Local Court that same day. 9 Following the sentence for murder, on the 27 March 1992, the applicant in the District Court at Sydney before Gallen DCJ pleaded guilty and was sentenced in respect of a number of offences including the escape itself and also a number of break, enter and steal, and larceny offences, committed between the time of the escape and the time of his re-arrest. For escape lawful custody, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of two years to commence at the expiration of the sentence being served at the time of the escape. His Honour was informed that the sentence expired on 4 February 1990 and dated the sentence for the escape from that date. It has since been ascertained that the date of expiry of the sentence being served at the time of the escape was miscalculated because the time spent at large following the escape was not taken into account and that correctly calculated the date of expiry of the original sentence should have been 31 March 1990. Most of the other sentences were for lesser periods or back dated and were made concurrent with that one, but on a charge of larceny of a motor vehicle from Werris Creek on 19 January 1988 he was sentenced to a minimum term of three years to date from the date of sentencing (ie 27 March 1992) with an additional term of one year. His Honour was of course aware that the sentences he was imposing were largely academic because of the life sentence that had already been imposed on the applicant, but it follows that until 26 March 1995 the applicant was serving sentences for the escape and the offences committed whilst at large. I shall come back to this aspect of the matter.10 After being sentenced for the murder on 11 October 1988, the applicant was classified A2 in Goulburn Correctional Centre. In 1991 whilst at the Reception Prison at Long Bay, where he had been moved temporarily to facilitate court appearances, he wrote a letter indicating that he had decided that he should do something to improve his life by undertaking education with a view to obtaining employment on his ultimate release, and he also at about this time obtained a position as head sweeper in which position he performed well. Up until this stage he had been on protection, but in 1992 he undertook and successfully completed a Motivation and Attitude Development course which became available to selected young inmates in protective custody, although it was necessary for them to cease being on protection whilst undergoing the programme. In November 1994 at his own request he was placed back in protective custody because he was experiencing difficulties with two fellow inmates and as a result he lost his employment as clerk in the Office of the Assistant Superintendent of Industries. 11 On 14 January 1995, he was listed for transfer to Goulburn but deliberately inflicted wounds on himself and was subsequently transferred to Lithgow on 28 February 1995. 12 Since about 1991 he has undertaken a number of courses particularly in the computer field and acquired a number of skills. He has generally received good reports. There have been some blemishes, including charges of cannabis in urine and attempts at self harm and a period at Lithgow Correctional Centre about 1995 when he was depressed. He was re-classified B in September 1995 and transferred to Grafton Correctional Centre where he worked in the print shop but he was on protection and the print shop was subsequently transferred to the minimum security section of the gaol. Apart from using cannabis and on occasions drugs such as Rohypnol etc, he has not been a heavy drug user and in particular he has not used heroin since he was a youth. He has been attending alcohol and other drug courses. Whilst at Lithgow he went on the Methadone program in an attempt to obtain medication for depression which he was then suffering rather than to deal with heroin dependency. 13 In September 1997 he was transferred to Junee Correctional Centre, which is wholly a protection institution. He subsequently applied to undertake the Special Care Programme which caters for inmates with behavioural problems which manifest in self defeating behaviour, and at the time of hearing, the result of his application was not known, although the assessment committee had met. He was undertaking a pre-university training course, working in the cable factory and doing a woodwork course. He gave evidence before me that his hopes for the future included successfully completing the course at the Special Care Unit, improving himself as a person to gain life skills so that hopefully one day he can integrate back into society. He hopes to obtain further educational skills particularly in the computing and social science fields. 14 He has been assessed by Dr Lucas, psychiatrist, whose diagnosis was that although he was not suffering from a major psychiatric disorder at the time of the murder, since being in prison he has had recurrent episodes of depression which he describes as ""an adjustment disorder with depressed mood"". At times paranoid feelings have also been apparent. He expressed the view that the applicant is suffering a personality disorder but its severity is difficult to assess as he has spent little time out of institutions with no real opportunities to demonstrate how he can function in the community. There were indications from his recent time in prison that he's settling down and can apply himself to studies and employment and is motivated to do something about himself. 15 Both to Dr Lucas and in his evidence before me he has accepted responsibility for his role in the murder and expressed contrition for it. In his application to be admitted to the Special Care Unit (10 October 1998) the applicant set out his list of goals if accepted for the programme as follows: 1. Anger management; 
     
      2. Assertiveness skills; 
      
      3. Learn the signs that manifest when reaching a state of depression, anger, procrastination; 
      
      4. Learn to put into practice rational thinking dissociated from negative emotions during stressful situations; and 
      
      5. Break the cycle of repetitive thought patterns linked to the past which are negative to his behaviour. 
      
     This list in my view shows an awareness of his current problems and a desire to overcome them.  
    16 The overall impression which I get is that in time he will reach a stage where he should be able to reintegrate into the community; that time has not yet come but the issue is not whether the time has yet arrived but whether there is a prospect of it occurring in the future. The fixing of a minimum term does not determine the date of his release, that is a matter for the Parole Board subject to the considerations set out in s 17 of the Sentencing Act 1987, and I am satisfied that this is an appropriate case for re-determination of the life sentence.17 The determination of the fresh sentence is complicated by the factors to which I have already referred, namely the fact that at the time of the murder he was an escapee from an outstanding sentence, which had to be completed on his recapture, and he has since been sentenced for the escape itself and a number of other offences committed whilst at large. A similar situation concerning escapees committing murder and other offences and being sentenced separately for the escape and other offences arose in R v Purdey (1992) 65 A Crim R 441 affirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal (1993) 31 NSWLR 668, SLR (1994) 181 CLR 691n and R v Haggart (unreported - Dunford J - 19 November 1993). 18 In respect of the escape and other offences committed whilst at large, a number of concurrent and partly concurrent sentences were imposed by Judge Gallen on 27 March 1992 the overall effect of which was that the longest minimum term expired 26 March 1995. 19 At the time he was taken into custody on 29 January 1988 he was an escapee and so continued serving his pre-existing sentences which did not expire until 31 March 1990, by which time he had been sentenced for the murder (on 21 September 1988). Accordingly when remanded in custody on 16 February 1988 it was not for this offence, and the appropriate date under s 13A (5) for commencement of the minimum term to be set on this application is the date on which the original sentence commenced (i.e. 21 September 1988): R v Purdey.20 Although the sentence must be backdated to the date of the original sentence, in calculating its length, these other outstanding sentences must not be disregarded as otherwise the applicant would in effect only be punished for the murder and not for the other offences. As Hunt J said in R v Purdey at 65 A Crim R at 447: ""As the judge resentencing pursuant to s 13A is precluded from making the fresh sentence cumulative upon others which the prisoner was serving when the original life sentence was imposed - or would have been serving when sentenced for the murder in the ordinary course of events - he or she must therefore make the sentence for murder longer to take those other crimes into account, provided that the sentence imposed for the murder remains individually proportionate to the crime for which it is imposed. Again, to hold otherwise would effectively mean that the applicant would not be punished for those other crimes."" 
     
     This passage was approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal at 31 NSWLR 668 at 680 per Carruthers J with whom on this point the other members of the Court agreed. Moreover, it is necessary to fix a sentence for the murder which reflects the seriousness of that offence and takes into account protection of the public, retribution, general and personal deterrence, as well as rehabilitation:  
     R v Purdey 
     . But regard must also be had to the principle of totality with the result that the additional term to be served for the murder will be less than it would have been if it had stood alone as a single offence and he were being sentenced for it in isolation. 
    21 Taking these factors into account I consider the additional minimum term which should be added to the other sentences (that is to be served beyond 26 March 1995) is twelve years, which as I say is considerably less than would have been an appropriate minimum term for this offence if it had stood alone, but it must be fixed by reference to a commencement date of 21 September 1988. 
    22 Stephen Arthur Leslie Maiden, for the murder of Mark Gerald White I re-sentence you to penal servitude for a minimum term of eighteen and a half years and it shall be deemed to have commenced on 21 September 1988. I fix an additional term of six years; the earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole will be 20 March 2007.

     REGINA v RALPH REYNOLD QUINLAN 
      
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Viney DCJ in the Sydney District Court. I propose to give relatively brief reasons for the conclusion that I will express. 2 The applicant appeared and pleaded guilty to two counts of armed robbery and one count of attempted armed robbery. On a schedule, five offences of stealing motor vehicles and one charge of escaping from lawful custody was taken into account. There was also a second indictment which related to three matters of assault which had apparently occurred at a prison farm. 3 The structure of the sentences imposed in the District Court were such that the sentence on the first count of the first indictment enveloped all of the periods imposed in respect of other matters. It is therefore sufficient in my view to focus attention upon that sentence which was a total of fourteen years penal servitude divided into minimum and additional terms of nine years and five years respectively.4 The applicant is a man of Aboriginal background. He had a not inconsiderable prior record. It is apparent that the offences would carry significant penalty.5 Mr Nicholson SC for the applicant has acknowledged that in the absence of special features the sentence which I have mentioned must be regarded as within the range of possible imposition.6 The applicant's case has been based upon four major premises. It is said that insufficient account was taken of the applicant's plea of guilty, of his rehabilitation prospects, his Aboriginality and finally and fourthly the assistance given by the applicant to authorities. 7 It has been acknowledged in the course of oral submissions that the shortly stated reference to the Aboriginality of the applicant was intended to refer to the frequent disadvantages manifest in persons who have had deprived backgrounds.8 In this case there was considerable evidence tendered to the sentencing Judge relating to this applicant in particular. His Honour referred to much of that material in his remarks on sentence. It is true that he did not indicate that he was giving any particular amount of discount from the sentence in relation to those matters but for my part I do not conclude that he overlooked them. Similarly, I am unpersuaded that his Honour overlooked in any relevant way the weight to be given to the plea of guilty and to the rehabilitation prospects of the applicant. I am, however, of the view that the applicant's case in relation to the discount that should be allowed for assistance to authorities has been made out.9 The reason that I propose to deal with this matter in relatively short form is the highly sensitive and important material which is contained in a sealed envelope which was sealed pursuant to an order by Viney DCJ that the same was not to be opened other than by direction of a Judge. I am familiar with the content of that envelope. For reasons of security I regard it as contrary to the interests of the applicant and public generally that I make specific reference to the nature and detail of what is contained therein. Nevertheless I should record my conclusion that the material relates to more than one aspect of assistance. The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing Judge that he was prepared to continue to render assistance and nothing was put before this court to suggest that that situation had altered in any way.10 I have described the material as sensitive. It is also of self evident importance and therefore I conclude that the applicant was entitled to a significant and weighty discount against any sentencing which otherwise ought to have been imposed.11 In the course of argument it was canvassed with the learned Crown Prosecutor that the ultimate total sentence of fourteen years penal servitude had to represent what I might describe in the vernacular as a “discounted” term, giving rise to the inevitable question of where did the penalty start. It must not be overlooked that his Honour was dealing with totality of criminality and not with a single count.12 The maximum penalty for a single count of armed robbery was twenty years. It therefore follows that the discount was something less than a third if, and I emphasise if, it was appropriate to start with a hypothesis of the maximum penalty.13 Serious though the offences were, and I have not taken time to describe them, I would not categorise them as in the worst range nor would I categorise the applicant in all the circumstances as within the range of worst offender.14 I have come to the conclusion that the total criminality of the applicant, giving him the discount which his assistance and offer of assistance merits, is to substitute a total term of nine years penal servitude for the longest term imposed below. The other terms can therefore stand including the penalty imposed upon the third count of the first indictment within which the matters on the schedule were taken into account. 15 The total period of nine years would represent a discount approaching forty percent of what I think would otherwise have been an appropriate sentence for the totality of criminality here manifest, giving proper weight to the subjective matters pertinent to the applicant.16 As is self evident from the division of the term imposed in the District Court his Honour found there was special circumstances justifying an extension of the additional term beyond that contemplated by s 5 of the Statute for reasons co ordinate with those found by his Honour. I too would extend the additional term and I would divide the total term of nine years into minimum and additional terms of six and three years. In my view that sentence would not offend against the prescription in s 444B(2) of the Crimes Act which requires that even where discount of this sort with which I am now dealing has been given the sentence itself should not be reduced below what is appropriate in all the circumstances.17 As I have indicated the enveloping term on the first count represents the effective term to be served by the applicant. Accordingly I propose the following orders: That the application for leave to appeal be granted; that the appeal be allowed; that the sentence imposed upon the first count of the first indictment be quashed and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to a total term of nine years penal servitude consist of a minimum term of six years commencing on 3 September 1996 and expiring on 2 September 2002 together with an additional term of three years commencing upon 3 September 2002. I would specify that the applicant is to be eligible for parole from 3 September 2002. I would confirm the sentence imposed on the second and third counts and the taking into account in relation to the sentence on the third count all the matters contained in the form 1. I would also confirm the sentences imposed in relation to the second indictment. 18 The reasons that I have adumbrated indicate the concern that I have in relation to the sensitive material contained in the envelope and I would direct that that material be resealed and not opened without the authority of a Judge.19 KIRBY J: I too am familiar with the contents of the envelope. I agree with the reasons that have been given and the orders proposed.20 GROVE J: The orders of the court will therefore be as I have proposed.

      The deceased worker brought proceedings in the Dust Diseases Tribunal against three employers for personal injuries suffered by him as a result of exposure to silica dust during the course of his employments. Following appeals to the Court of Appeal and the High Court, the High Court remitted the assessment of damages to the Tribunal. The trial Judge found that the deceased suffered two separate injuries, silicosis and then a progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). He found that the second injury was damage caused by the concurrent torts of the defendants, but that different parts of the silicosis had been caused by each of the tortfeasors and made separate awards for silicosis against each of the employers and a single award for the PMF against the second and third employers. The second and third employers challenged the Judge’s finding that the PMF was a separate injury attracting a separate award of damages, the awards for the silicosis, the allowance for future medical expenses and the deduction for future weekly compensation benefits under the  
      Workers Compensation (Dust Diseases) Act  
      1942. 
       
      HELD 
      : 
       allowing the appeal in part: (1) The trial Judge was entitled to find that the PMF was a separate injury. (2) The appellant’s challenges to the trial Judge’s separate awards for the silicosis failed. (3) The award for future medical expenses should have been disallowed as they were payable as compensation benefits under the  
      Dust Diseases Act.  
      (4) The claim for a further deduction for future pension payments payable under the  
      Dust Diseases Act  
      succeeded. The provisions of the amended s 12 D of the  
      Dust Diseases Tribunal Act  
      1989 prohibiting deductions from awards for non-economic loss, did not overrule the general principle that future pension entitlements should be deducted from other components of an award of common law damages.

       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 THE COURT: This is the second series of appeals to this Court from the assessment of the damages payable to the late Denis Hollins (“the worker”) for personal injuries suffered by him as a result of his exposure to silica dust during his employment. The first judgment of Johns J delivered on 16 December 1992 in favour of the worker against all three defendants for $502,272 was reversed by this Court on 22 December 1993 on grounds relating to both liability and damages. The judgments in favour of the worker were restored, except on the issue of damages, by the High Court on 3 April 1996. See Harris v Commercial Minerals Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 1. The formal orders of the High Court, so far as relevant were (par 3(a)) that “in lieu of the said orders of the New South Wales Court of Appeal order that (a) the appeals to that Court against the assessment of damages by the Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales be allowed” and (par 3(c)) that “the matter be remitted to the Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales to assess the damages to be awarded against the second and third defendants before that Tribunal on the basis of the findings of and the evidence before Judge Johns”.2  The proceedings were brought by the worker in the Tribunal against three of his employers which had exposed him to dust in the course of his employment. He was employed by the first defendant from 25 October 1953 until 31 March 1955 and from 8 July 1957 to 12 July 1962 for a total of some 6 years and 5 months. He was employed by the second defendant (Auqal Pty Ltd, the second appellant) from 1 July 1969 to 31 March 1973 for 3 years and 9 months, and by the third defendant, Commercial Minerals Ltd (the first appellant), from 31 March 1973 to 15 August 1986 for 13 years and 5 months. In his original judgment Johns J found all defendants liable to the worker and entered judgments for the damages assessed “against each of the defendants”. The issues relating to damages litigated in the first appeals to this Court were the validity of these judgments for the same amount against consecutive tortfeasors, and whether “future compensation benefits under” the Workers Compensation (Dust Diseases) Act 1942 should be deducted when assessing the worker’s future economic loss.3  The High Court held that this Court had been correct in holding “that the present value of the future benefits payable under the Dust Diseases Act was deductible from the worker’s damages” (ibid 16, 18). The worker had died pending the appeal to the High Court and his administratrix did not challenge this Court’s decision that a single judgment should not have been entered against the three defendants (ibid 18-19).4  On the new trial Johns J held that the deceased had suffered from silicosis, and progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) which developed from the underlying silicosis. He found that “The process that takes place is a coalescence of the rounded deposits into a single mass and once contracted it inevitably will progress, although the rate of progression varies with the individual”. He further found that “the PMF is distinct from the silicosis and is the consequence … of all exposure until 1982”. Accordingly he found that the separate torts of each defendant combined to produce a second injury and concluded: “The PMF condition is therefore the direct product of a group of acts not simultaneous, all converging to bring about one occurrence of damage and in those circumstances it can be fairly said to be indivisible. The PMF therefore was caused by all the defendants. I conclude therefore that in respect to the PMF the condition is one and indivisible and the defendants therefore are … severally liable for it”.5  The Judge reassessed the worker’s damages at $405,400. He apportioned 40 percent of this to the silicosis and 60 percent to the PMF, and held that the second and third employers were liable as several concurrent tortfeasors for $243,240 damages for the PMF. He apportioned the damages of $162,160 awarded for the silicosis between the three employers as consecutive tortfeasors in the proportions 20 percent, 45 percent and 35 percent, and awarded damages of $72,972 against the second employer and $56,756 against the third employer on this basis.6  The third employer appealed within time challenging the finding that the PMF was a separate, single injury caused by the wrongful acts of all three employers, the apportionment of the damages for silicosis, and the allowance of $41,921 for future medical expenses which it said should have been disallowed as they were payable as compensation benefits under the Dust Diseases Act.7  The second employer did not appeal in time, because its workers’ compensation insurer believed that its liability under the common law extension in its policy was limited to $50,000. It later discovered that its limit of liability was apparently $200,000. It then sought and was granted leave to appeal out of time. It also challenged the finding that PMF was a separate condition which gave rise to entitlements to a single award against all three employers, the apportionment in respect of the damages for silicosis, the allowance for future medical expenses, and the deduction of future weekly compensation benefits under the Dust Diseases Act for only 7.5 years instead of 12 years. It was recognised that the second employer’s late application for leave to appeal out of time could be relevant on costs.8  Mr Hoeben SC, who appeared for the second employer, contended that $47,024 should be deducted from the Judge’s assessment for future medical expenses ($41,921) and future hospice care ($5,103), and a further $39,628 should be deducted for future weekly compensation benefits for the difference between 7.5 years and 12 years.9  After the Court granted leave to appeal out of time to the second employer, Mr Toomey QC for the third employer sought and was granted leave to amend its notice of appeal to include a new ground 10 covering the Judge’s refusal to allow a deduction for future weekly compensation benefits for 12 years instead of 7.5 years. It was again recognised that this late amendment could be relevant on costs. The findings relating to PMF10  Mr Toomey submitted that it was not open to the trial Judge, consistently with his original reasons for judgment, to find that PMF was a separate condition, and not simply part of the worker’s silicosis. The finding that PMF was a separate condition, made in the second judgment of the trial Judge, was said to be contrary to the High Court’s direction that the worker’s damages be assessed “on the basis of the findings and evidence before” the Judge. There is no substance in this submission. In his original reasons the Judge found that the plaintiff suffered from silicosis “complicated by progressive massive fibrosis” which had developed due to “relatively high levels of silica dust exposure”. This was in substance a finding that the worker was suffering from PMF as a separate condition and the medical evidence supports this finding. His Honour had no occasion, in his first judgment, to emphasise the distinction between the two conditions because it was not thought legally necessary to do so, but nevertheless the finding was clearly made. Dust Diseases Act11  The award of $47,024 for future medical expenses and hospice care was not separately or clearly challenged in the first appeals to this Court either in the notices of appeal or during the hearing. The point was not mentioned in this Court’s reasons for judgment, but the orders for new trials made by this Court would have permitted the third employer to raise that question on the new trial. The specific point is not referred to in the reasons or orders of the High Court either, although the right to payment for medical expenses is clearly a benefit receivable under the Act. See the Workers Compensation (Dust Diseases) Act s 8 (2)(d) and see also James Hardie & Co Pty Ltd v Newton (1997) 42 NSWLR 729, 737, 741.12  The question could never have arisen if the original notices of appeal to this Court had complied with SCR Pt 51 r 11(1)(c) which requires a notice of appeal to state “specifically” the grounds of appeal, and r 11(1)(d) which requires it to state the judgment sought in place of the judgment below. Neither of the original notices of appeal took the point about future medical expenses “specifically”. Mr Toomey informed the Court that the point as to such expenses was taken at the first trial by Mr Little, who appeared for the third employer, and it may be significant that the damages then awarded did not include any amount for past medical expenses. However the other counsel, particularly Mr Jackson QC and his junior who appeared for the worker’s estate but had not appeared at the first trial, were not able to confirm Mr Little’s recollection and the Court cannot act on Mr Toomey’s statement. This of course is not intended to reflect in any way on Mr Little’s integrity.13  In these circumstances the question turns on the effect of the orders of the High Court. The judgments in favour of the worker at the original trial were set aside on the question of damages, and the proceedings remitted to the Dust Diseases Tribunal “to assess the damages to be awarded against the second and third defendants … on the basis of the findings of and the evidence before Judge Johns”. The judgments entered after the original trial were therefore set aside and could not prevent the employers relitigating the question of future medical expenses. See Roe v R A Naylor Ltd (1918) 87 LJKB 958 CA, 963; Butler v Butler (1894) P 25 CA, 29.14  The order of the High Court that the damages be assessed on the basis of the findings and the evidence at the first trial prevented the evidence being automatically reopened, preserved the trial Judge’s findings of primary fact, and any issue estoppels as to facts fundamental to the assessment. See Blair v Curran (1939) 62 CLR 464, 532. The orders did not otherwise bind the parties or the Judge on the new assessment. In particular they did not bind the parties or the Judge on questions of law.15  The appellants’ point relating to future medical expenses arose on the face of the Judge’s original reasons for judgment and did not require any amendment to the pleadings, or any additional evidence. The Judge’s summary of his first assessment showed that his award included (255) “future medical expenses $41,921.00”.16  His reasons for judgment also showed that his award of $21,658 for Future Domestic Assistance and Hospice care included $5,103 for the latter (254). There was no dispute before us that the latter amount was a medical or hospital expense payable under the Act. 17  The propriety of including these sums in the reassessment of the worker’s damages raised a question of law. The general question as to future benefits under the Act was covered by the decision of the High Court but there was no decision on particular benefits other than the pension payments. In our judgment the points as to these items, which raised a pure question of law, were open to the appellants on the reassessment, and are open to them in these appeals. We would uphold the appeals as to these items and reduce the damages accordingly.18  The second question as to the effect of the Act concerns the amount of $39,628 being the present value of future pension payments under the Act for 4.5 years after the worker attained 65. At the new trial the appellants unsuccessfully contended for a deduction for the present value of pension payments for 12 years based on the worker’s then expectation of life. The trial Judge followed the decision of O’Meally J in Katidis v Meggitt (Overseas) Ltd (No 2) (1995) 11 NSWCCR 147 on this question and allowed only 7.5 years for the period until the worker’s normal retirement at 65. This decision has since been overruled in James Hardie & Co Pty Ltd v Newton (1997) 42 NSWLR 729. Consistently with this decision the appellants were entitled to a further deduction for the $39,628.19  This Court reserved its decision on 4 November 1998, but thereafter the Parliament amended the Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989 to insert a new s 12D(2) which provided: “In determining damages for non-economic loss in any such proceedings, no deduction is to be made for any amount of compensation already paid or payable, or payable in the future, under the Workers Compensation (Dust Diseases) Act 1942”.20  Section 12D(3) provides: “In this section: 
     
      
       Damages for non-economic loss means damages or compensation for the loss following: 
       
       (a) pain and suffering, 
       
       (b) loss of amenities of life, 
       
       (c) loss of expectation of life, 
       
       (d) disfigurement, 
       
       (e) the need for services of a domestic nature or services relating to nursing and attendance which have been or are to be provided to a person by another person, and for which the first person has not paid and is not liable to pay any fee or charge”. 
      
    21  Sub section (1) provides that the section applies to proceedings in the Tribunal, and on appeal from the Tribunal, for damages in relation to dust-related conditions. The Act was proclaimed to commence on 1 December 1998. Section 10 of the Workers Compensation Legislation Amendment (Dust Diseases and Other Matters) Act 1998, which inserted s 12D in the Tribunal Act, provides: “(1) Section 12D, which was inserted by the amending Act, applies in relation to causes of action arising before or after the commencement of that section, and extends to proceedings pending at that commencement, 
     
      
       (2) However, section 12D does not apply in relation to a cause of action to the extent that proceedings on the cause of action have been determined before the commencement of that section”. 
      
    22  In view of the express provision in s 12D(1) extending to appellate proceedings, the section must be applied in the determination of these appeals. The Judge’s revised assessment of $405,400 was based on his original assessment of $502,272 which he reduced by $18,600 to adjust for an error in calculating interest on past economic loss, and $78,272 for future pension payments under the Act. Section 12D did not overrule the general principle established in Harris v Commercial Minerals (1996) 186 CLR 1 that future pension entitlements should be deducted from “awards of damages in respect of injuries giving rise to those benefits” so as to be “deductible from any common law damages” (ibid 18) but only that part of Newton’s case that held that future benefits could be deducted from general damages as defined.23  The Judge’s original award included $120,743 for loss of future earnings calculated over a period of 7.5 years from the date of judgment. The deduction of $78,272 made by the Judge, and a further deduction of $39,628 for the next 4.5 years, total $117,900 which is less than the amount included for future economic loss. However consistently with Harris v Commercial Minerals, and the unreversed part of the decision in Newton, there is no reason why these entitlements should not have been deducted from the total award for economic loss including past economic loss. In our judgment therefore the appeals also succeed in respect of this further sum of $39,628. Apportionment24  The appellants did not otherwise challenge the apportionment of the damages between the PMF at 60 percent and the silicosis at 40 percent but both challenged the apportionment of responsibility for the silicosis part of the award. The first employer who was responsible for 27 percent of the exposure on a purely time basis was held responsible for 20 percent of the damage. The second employer responsible for 16 percent of the exposure on a time basis was held responsible for 45 percent of the damage, and the third employer with 57 percent of the exposure on a time basis was held responsible for 35 percent. If the period during which the worker was exposed to excessive dust was the only relevant factor, these apportionments could not be supported but other factors are also relevant.25  One matter relied upon by the appellants related to the date when the worker’s PMF was first detected or diagnosed. The trial Judge found that this occurred in 1982 relying on Dr Field’s report to the Dust Diseases Board of 24 December (223). He said: “There is some reference in Dr Field’s report of serial X-rays between 1971 and 1982 which to the doctor reveals steady progression of the PMF. Dr Field did not give oral evidence in this case. I have already referred to his report … regarding the diagnosis and its cause. No other X-rays other than the two referred to in Dr Field’s report have been observed by any other medical practitioner. There is no explanation as to whether or not Dr Field is referring to two X-rays or more than two X-rays in his report. As Dr Gianoutsos indicated … Dr Field may have been saying that the plaintiff had nodular disease at the outset and that the nodular disease progressed in terms of the areas of nodulates coalescing together. Although it is open to submit that the PMF was present at the time of the diagnosis in 1971, I conclude that on the basis of the preponderance of medical evidence that the PMF was first observed and diagnosed in 1982 as a consequence of the X-rays of 28 October 1982. Dr Field was not called to elaborate or to confirm the existence of more than two X-rays. It is clear to me as I have indicated that when he refers to serial films he refers merely to the films of 11 June 1971 and 28 October 1982”.26  We cannot agree with the Judge’s conclusions on this question. The letter was tendered by Mr Little for the third employer from the file of the Dust Diseases Board on 16 December 1992 (original appeal books volume 1/220) “in respect of the limitation question only” (222) because the history was relevant to the plaintiff’s knowledge (221). No one required Dr Field to be called to give oral evidence, and no one sought to tender additional documents from the Dust Diseases Board file. Mr Little had earlier (3 December 1992) cross-examined Dr Gianoutsos about some of the statements in the letter (110-12) but the doctor was never shown the letter itself, and there was no re-examination.27  In these circumstances Dr Gianoutsos’s speculations about the meaning of the letter are not entitled to any weight, and this Court must interpret it for itself, being, in this respect, in as good a position as the trial Judge. Dr Field conducted exercise and lung function tests on the worker on 21 December 1982. He referred to these and continued: “Serial films from 11.6.1971 to 28.10.1982 reveal steady progression of the massive fibrosis with a reduction in lung volume and, to a large extent, disappearance of the background nodulation … On the information available to me I conclude that his pulmonary lesion is due to progressive massive fibrosis caused by exposure to silica during the course of his employment”.28  In our judgment this cannot be read as a reference to x-ray films taken only on 11 June 1971 and 28 October 1982. Dr Field speaks of “serial films” which indicates, on the dictionary meanings of “serial”, more than two, and these are “from” 11/6/71 “to” 28/10/82 and not simply “of” those dates. The films are said to reveal “steady progression” of the PMF which can only mean that other films taken within that period had also been seen which revealed both the progression and the steadiness of its development.29  The letter, in our opinion, is totally inconsistent with the view that the worker’s PMF had only commenced a short time before December 1982. However it does not establish that he was suffering from PMF in June 1971. It is entirely possible that the PMF was not visible in the earliest x-rays, and only appeared later in the series, and then steadily progressed to October 1982. There is no evidence as to the dates of the other x-rays in the series, or as to the Board’s practice in monitoring the condition of dust affected workers.30  This interpretation of the letter is supported by the evidence that the worker’s condition was being monitored by the Dust Diseases Board. His condition was diagnosed in 1971 when he first consulted the Board, and was assessed as having a 10 percent disability. In 1978 he was assessed as having a 40 percent disability, and in 1982, 50 percent. 31  No one took the point that the report of Dr Field was not in evidence on the issue of damages and all parties appeared to have treated it as available for that purpose. There is no record of it having been re-tendered on the issue of damages, but it is possible that this did occur and was not formally recorded. Whatever the strict position may have been all parties, including the Judge, acquiesced in the new trial being conducted on the basis that this letter was available to the defendants.32  However this conclusion does not invalidate the Judge’s apportionment. The Court cannot make a finding as to when the PMF was first apparent in the worker’s x-rays, although it must have been well before 1982. His employment with the second employer ceased on 31 March 1973, but on 1 July 1972 he ceased working full time in the factory and began to work as a truck driver. He was employed as a truck driver by the third employer from 1 April 1973 to 15 August 1986. His work as a truck driver reduced, but did not eliminate, his exposure to dust. The loading and unloading of his truck generated dust and loading occurred in a loading dock which was exposed to dust from the factory. He also worked in the factory on Saturdays for three years, and at other times when his truck was being serviced, or for other reasons.33  The Judge found that the worker was exposed to very high levels of silica dust while employed full time in the factory by the first and second employers, and to significant levels of dust while employed by the second and third employers as a truck driver. These findings were not challenged.34  The plaintiff was diagnosed as having a 50 percent disability in 1982. In 1985 he had a 60 percent disability and then in 1986 first 70 percent and shortly afterwards 100 percent. He retired from the workforce in August. In his second decision the Judge found that the prognosis for silicosis is idiosyncratic and unpredictable. However if there is continued exposure to silica this would “materially contribute to the disease and its progression”, and the rate of progression will be increased. Continuous exposure in someone who already has an established disease worsens the problem as the lungs take on an extra burden of silica. Both the amount and the period of further exposure are significant.35  Once PMF is contracted it will inevitably progress, although the rate of progression will vary with the individual. Dr Joseph, called by the third employer, confirmed the significance of the worker’s exposure from 1972 to 1981, saying that all exposure had been significant, and that the total dose of dust was important and materially contributed to the PMF. The dust therefore has a cumulative effect on the lungs. According to Dr Gianoutsos the worker’s continued exposure to silica accentuated and aggravated his problems. The fact that the PMF developed some time before 1982 does not affect these findings because it cannot be found to have developed before the worker commenced with the third employer on 1 April 1973.36  The exposure to dust during his employment with the first employer ceased in 1969 and by itself may not have been sufficient to cause silicosis, let alone PMF. Silicosis was diagnosed in June 1971 but at that stage the worker’s disability was only 10 percent. His continuing exposure during employment with the second employer, building on his earlier exposure, was sufficient to cause silicosis and the worker experienced his first symptoms in 1972 (AB 52). The Judge’s award for past economic loss dated from 1 July that year. The causative potency of the worker’s heavy exposure with the second employer was significant as it had a cumulative effect on his earlier exposure, triggered the onset of his silicosis, and also had a catalytic or compounding effect. The causative potency of his exposure with the third employer was much less because the degree of exposure was much less, although that lesser exposure continued for a long time and also had a catalytic or compounding effect on the result of his earlier exposures.37  Mr Hoeben submitted that the culpability of all the employers was the same but we cannot agree. Safety standards in this industry should have been rising with growing awareness of the hazards of exposure to excessive dust. His employment with the first employer from October 1953 to March 1955, and from July 1957 to July 1962, was relatively early and his employment with the others was significantly later. The worker was diagnosed with silicosis on 11 June 1971, which ought to have alerted the second employer to the need to take additional precautions in general, and to take additional precautions for the safety of this worker in particular. Compare Paris v Stepney Borough Council [1951] AC 367. Nothing was done until July 1972 but even then significant exposure continued. Nothing was done by the third employer to improve dust conditions during the long period from April 1973 to August 1986.38  The Judge had to weigh all these factors to arrive at an apportionment, and given the different culpabilities and causative potencies of the conduct of the three employers we have not been persuaded that his apportionment was beyond the range of a sound exercise of his discretion. See The Macgregor [1943] AC 197, 201. We would therefore dismiss the appeals on this issue.39  In our opinion the appeals should be allowed in part, the assessment of $405,400 should be set aside, and an assessment of $318,748 substituted to reflect the deductions of $41,921; $5,103, and $39,628 previously referred to. The judgments against the second and third employers should be set aside and several judgments entered for $191,248.80 against each of them as concurrent tortfeasors, a several judgment for $57,374.55 entered against the second employer, and a several judgment for $44,624.65 against the third employer in each case as consecutive tortfeasors.40  The appellants have succeeded in reducing the judgments against them by substantial amounts. However the second employer obtained leave to appeal out of time at the hearing, and the third employer then obtained leave to add the ground of appeal relating to the period for which future pension payments should be deducted.41  The Judge did not direct the entry of judgment in favour of the worker as from the date of his original judgment as he was bound to do, having regard to the death of the worker and the orders made by the High Court. See Wing Lee v Lew [1925] AC 819. The formal judgment was not taken out and included in the appeal book. The form of the Judge’s direction for the entry of judgment probably deprived the worker’s estate of interest on the judgment from 22 December 1992, when the first judgment was entered, to 27 September 1996 and may have had other consequences. The Court drew this matter to the attention of the parties, and agreement was reached on the appropriate form of judgment which secured the estate’s entitlement to interest from 22 December 1992, rendering unnecessary a cross-appeal out of time by the administratrix.42  The bulk of the hearing time was taken up with the appellants’ challenges to the finding that the PMF was a separate condition, and the apportionment for the silicosis on which they were unsuccessful. Each employer was a disputing respondent to the others’ appeal on the apportionment issue. Taking all these factors into account, we would order that each appellant pay one third of the costs of the administratrix, and that there be no other orders as to costs.43  The orders we would propose are therefore: 
     
      
      (1) Appeals allowed; 
       
      (2) Set aside the assessment in the Dust Diseases Tribunal of

        substitute an assessment of $318,748; 
        
       
      
      
      (3) Set aside the judgments entered against the first and 
       
        
        second appellants in the Dust Diseases Tribunal except 
         
        as to costs and substitute in favour of the worker: 
         
         (a) several judgments for $191,248.80 against

         (b) a several judgment for $57,374.55 against 
          
           
            
            the second appellant (the second employer), 
             
            as a consecutive tortfeasor, 
            
           
          
         (c) a several judgment for $44,624.65 against the 
          
           
            
            first appellant (the third employer) as a  
             
            consecutive tortfeasor, 
            
           
          
         
        with effect from 22 December 1992. 
        
       
      (4) The first and second appellants are each to pay one third of the 
       
        
        costs of the first respondent, the administratrix of the estate of 
         
        the deceased worker of the appeals; 
        
       
      (5) Otherwise no order as to costs.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
      
     1  
     THE COURT 
     : The appellants Brendan Fernando and his cousin Vester Allan Fernando were jointly indicted on charges of the murder and aggravated sexual assault of Sandra Hoare. Both appellants pleaded not guilty but after a lengthy trial the jury found them guilty of murder. In the case of Brendan Fernando he was found guilty on the second count as charged. In the case of Vester Fernando the trial judge directed a verdict of not guilty on the aggravated sexual assault charge but the jury found him guilty of assault with intent to have sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation. 
      
     2  
     Each appellant was sentenced for the crime of murder to penal servitude for the term of his natural life. In each case the second offence attracted a penalty of ten years penal servitude. 
      
     3  
     Each appellant has appealed against his conviction and also seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. 
      
     4  
     It was the Crown case that the appellants abducted the deceased, a young nurse then on duty at the Walgett District Hospital, and that following her abduction she was sexually assaulted and then murdered. It was claimed these events took place very early on the morning of 9 December 1994. The deceased’s body was found in a paddock some 400 metres away from the hospital. The evidence was that the deceased had sustained a number of cuts to the jaw but there were two very severe wounds to the neck. One of these wounds was more than half way around the neck but was mainly to the left side and to the back of it. The wound passed through a number of muscles, the jugular vein and the left vertebral artery. That wound alone would have cause death, but there was a second severe wound across the front of the neck and that passed through the larynx and into the voice box. 
      
     5  
     There was evidence from the deceased’s fiance that he saw the deceased dress for work before he drove her to the hospital and that she dressed in a bra, panties, a white shirt, slacks, sockettes and shoes. Her hair was pulled back with a tie at the back. When the body was discovered the deceased was found to be naked except for a pair of slacks, shoes and sockettes. There was some material around her neck. The zippered fly of the slacks was undone and the slacks were secured by a single button. The deceased’s underclothing was never found. 
      
     6  
     The nature of the case presented by the Crown against each of the appellants and the responses of the appellants may be summarised as follows: 
      
       
       As against Vester Fernando 
       
      
     7  
     This was based upon circumstantial evidence. For some time prior to the date of the murder this appellant had been staying at the Orana Haven. Evidence was called from three other occupants that they had seen him in possession of machetes there. There was also evidence that he was seen in possession of at least one machete in Walgett on the night of 8 December 1994. There were many witnesses who saw the appellant that night: 
      
       
        
         
         (i) Wendy Fernando, the appellant’s sister said that the appellant arrived at her home in Walgett at about 6.00 pm, bringing with him his overnight bag. He was subsequently driven to a hotel and the appellant’s sister last saw him at that hotel about 10.00 pm. She next saw him at her home the following morning. 
          
         (ii) Sharada Morgan gave evidence of seeing both appellants in a street in Walgett early on the morning of 9 December 1994. She said that she was with her brother Lindsay and another person at the time. She saw a police vehicle approaching in the street and she said she saw Brendan Fernando throw a knife into the bush when the police car passed by. She said that Brendan retrieved the knife afterwards and gave it to the appellant Vester who put it down his shorts. She said that she later saw both appellants and Michael Jackson walking in the direction of the hospital. 
          
         (iii) Lindsay Morgan said that he saw the appellants in the street at 1.00 am or 2.00 am on 9 December. He said that the appellant Vester was holding a machete in his right hand and that the appellant Brendan was walking beside him. He said he heard the appellant Vester ask Brendan to go back to the hospital and steal a car and he also heard both appellants ask Michael Jackson to go with them and he saw them walking towards the hospital. 
          
         (iv) Robert Walford placed his meeting in the street with the appellants as having occurred at about midnight. He was involved in an altercation with Vester that he said lasted for up to thirty minutes. He said that during it, Vester grabbed him by the shirt with his left hand and he said that he saw that this appellant had a machete with him. 
          
         (v) Michael Jackson, whose evidence is the subject of a number of grounds of appeal, was cross-examined by the Crown on a statement he had made to the police on 11 December 1994. In that statement he said that he saw the appellants in the street and that Vester invited him to join them to steal a car. In the statement he said that Vester said  
         “Don’t worry about anyone grabbing you Mick, I’ve got a machete here.” 
          He said that Vester pulled up his shirt and showed him a blade of what looked like a machete and added  
         “If anyone grabs you, I’ll kill them.” 
          He said that he told the police in that statement that Vester said he was going to his sister’s place to get a screwdriver to break into the car. Jackson parted company with the appellants after that conversation. 
         
        
       
      
     8  
     Two machetes were found in a dam not far from the place where the body of the deceased was discovered and the medical evidence was that either machete could have inflicted the wounds found on the victim’s body. 
      
     9  
     Then evidence was introduced in the Crown case that a car owned by Mrs Wells, was broken into in the hospital grounds just outside the ward where the deceased was on duty that night and items were taken from it that were later linked to this appellant. A screwdriver was found near the machetes which evidence indicated could have caused the damage to Mrs Wells’ car. 
      
     10  
     Adam Jackson was a male nurse at the hospital and he was living in a relationship with Mrs Wells. He said that he drove her vehicle to the hospital, parking it outside the ward where the deceased was on duty at about 10.45 pm on 8 December. The following morning at about 2.45 am he went over to the ward to visit the deceased but could not find her. He did however come upon a patient with a head wound and he noticed blood in the building. He also discovered that the car had been damaged. There was a broken window and there was damage to the lock and to the ignition. He noticed that tapes were missing from the glove box as well as sunglasses, a photograph of Mrs Wells’ children and other items. 
      
     11  
     Mrs Wells later identified items recovered by the police as being her property taken from her car. The property so identified had been recovered by police in various areas. When police executed a search warrant at the premises where the appellant claimed to have spent the night of 9 December they found an open clear plastic audio cassette cover with a portion of an audio cassette insert bearing the words “Bon Jovi Bed of Roses” printed on it. A further part of the Bon Jovi cassette cover was found at the base of a tree near the levee bank and it matched what was missing from what police recovered from the house. Subsequently the police found a bag in the boot of a car in which Vester Fernando travelled to Dubbo shortly after the death of the deceased. That bag, which was identified as being this appellant’s bag, contained a number of items taken from Mrs Wells’ car, including a torn photograph of her children and paper on which her former husband’s name, address and phone number were recorded. Mrs Wells also identified as taken from her car some children’s sunglasses found in an area to which the police investigations had taken them, and through which the footprints hereunder described proceeded. 
      
     12  
     There was footprint evidence relied upon by the Crown. There was evidence that it rained heavily about 2.30 am on 9 December and the soil in the Walgett area was heavy, tending to be sticky when wet and to adhere to footwear. Muddy shoe prints were found in the hospital building from which the deceased had, on the Crown case, been abducted. There were footprints found in the vicinity of the car. There were further shoe impressions in the soil across the front of the hospital building and near a set of steps at the end of the relevant ward, so the Crown case was that whoever broke into the vehicle proceeded into the hospital building. 
      
     13  
     Footprints were then observed that led away from the hospital. There were three sets that led to a place where, on the Crown, the deceased was attacked. At that point there was an area of disturbed ground in a timbered area near a rugby oval. In that disturbed ground there was a black coloured hair elastic and a pair of scissors with the name “Sandra” on them, a lens cleaning cloth and a small metal button identical in appearance to those on the blouse of the deceased later identified. The three sets of footprints led away then from that area to where the body was found. From that point there were two sets of footprints that continued on approximately one metre apart. The tracks led to the levee bank where part of the cassette cover and a screwdriver were found. There was a single set of tracks that crossed the levee bank and looped back, then two sets of tracks moved on to the street, where they disappeared. 
      
     14  
     There was evidence that the size of an impression taken was similar in length to the size of the shoes which the appellant claimed he was wearing. The cast was taken from a barred shoe impression near the rugby oval, and that impression was similar to impressions seen both inside and outside the hospital building in which the deceased had been working. There was an issue as to whether this appellant was wearing black shoes as he claimed because Lindsay Morgan said that when he encountered the appellant he was wearing brown riding boots, and Robert Walford said he was wearing what he described as a pair of hob nail shoes like work boots. 
      
     15  
     This appellant gave evidence. He denied going anywhere near the hospital. He denied possessing any machetes. He admitted the encounter with Robert Walford but said that what he was holding at that time was a small iron bar that he found. His evidence was that after the encounter with Walford he met Michael Jackson and that Jackson, Brendan and himself went to his sister’s place to have a smoke and there the appellant said he remained. 
      
       
       As against Brendan Fernando 
       
      
     16  
     The Crown relied in part upon the same circumstantial evidence as that relied upon against his cousin. Additionally however, the Crown relied upon admissions made by this appellant in the course of: 
      
       
        
         
         (i) an interview, details of which were recorded in a police notebook entry signed by the appellant; 
          
         (ii) at an electronically recorded interview; and 
          
         (iii) in a “runaround” which was recorded on video and also on tape. 
         
        
       
      
     17  
     This appellant did not give evidence at the trial. A psychologist was called however and expressed the opinion that the appellant had an intellectual disability. It was urged that this and the appellant’s consumption of alcohol would have affected his capacity to enter into an understanding or arrangement with the co-appellant such as had been advanced by the Crown. It was further submitted that if there was an agreement with Vester Fernando it only related to stealing a car. What the appellant told the police was true and he was not a party to any common enterprise that extended to the killing of the deceased. 
      
     18  
     The admissions made by Brendan Fernando and the circumstances in which they were made are the subject of the first of the grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant Brendan Fernando, to a consideration of which we now turn. Because the detail of these admissions and the evidence that emerged on the runaround are at the core of the appellant Vester Fernando’s submission that he should have been granted a separate trial, it is convenient to deal with Brendan Fernando’s appeal first. 
      
       
     APPEAL OF BRENDAN FERNANDO 
      
      Ground 1: The learned trial judge erred in allowing into evidence the admissions made by police to the appellant 
      
     19  
     Before the evidence in point was admitted against the appellant there was an extensive voir dire hearing at the conclusion of which his Honour stated reasons for admitting the relevant evidence to go before the jury. It will, of course, be necessary to consider his Honour’s reasons when addressing this ground but at the outset it is desirable to look at the sequence of events in the course of which the admissions were elicited.  
      
     20  
     Early on 10 December 1994, some time shortly after midnight, Det. Sgt Pollock and other police officers attended 79 Dewhurst Street, Walgett where the appellant was staying with his sister and her de facto husband, Colin Morris. The appellant was awakened and asked to go the police station to be questioned. Whilst the evidence of Colin Morris was that Sgt Pollock informed the appellant at his house that the police officer wanted to question him about an assault charge, Sgt Pollock’s account was that he said he wanted to question him about the killing of the nurse at the hospital.  
      
     21  
     The admissions were made at various stages in the course of events beginning at 12.50 am. It is necessary to set out the relevant evidence in close detail: 
      
       
       (i) The police notebook admissions: in the first instance Det. Sgt Pollock asked the appellant a number of questions to which the appellant responded. These questions and answers were recorded in the police officer’s notebook in the course of an interview that began at about 12.50 am and continued until about 1.10 am.  
        
       (ii) Sgt Pollock then advised the appellant that there would be an electronic interview but the appellant indicated he was not prepared to be interviewed in that way. Sgt Pollock then said he was compelled to ask some questions on the electronic machine. However before the ERISP began, Sgt Pollock asked the appellant:  
       “Where is the machete now?” 
        The appellant responded:  
       “Vester threw it over the levee bank.” 
        Sgt Pollock asked:  
        
         
       “Q. Are you prepared to show us where you threw it? 
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
        Q. Are you prepared to go with us to show us what happened with the woman and we will have a video made of what you show us? 
        
        A. I don’t want to go too close to where it happened. 
        
        Q. Are you prepared to go with us to that area? 
        
        A. Yeah, but not too close.” 
        
       (iii) Then the ERISP interview took place from 1.45 am to 1.58 am. In the course of this interview the appellant was asked these questions and gave these answers: 
        
         
       “Q.10 Do you agree to be electronically interviewed? 
        
        A. No. 
        
        Q.11 Is that no? 
        
        A. No, I don’t want do it. 
        
        Q.12 Just for the purpose of this interview would you repeat your full name, date of birth and your address? 
        
        A. Brendan Fernando. Seventh of the tenth, seventy nine. 
        
        Q.13 And your address? 
        
        A. Seventy four Arthur Street Walgett. 
        
        Q.14 Seventy four Arthur Street Walgett was it. 
        
        A. ------------------- 
        
        Q.15 Right. Are you prepared to be interviewed by way of a typed record of interview. (Pause) Do you understand that question? 
        
        A. Yeah I do, but ____________ 
        
        Q.16 Sorry. 
        
        A. I don’t think I can handle an interview at the moment. 
        
        Q.17 You don’t think you could handle an interview at the moment. Do you agree that while I was talking to you earlier I wrote the questions and answers in my notebook. 
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
        Q.18 Are you prepared to read this notebook and um tell me whether the questions and answers entered there are correct? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q.19 Or do you want, I may have to help you read them. Are you prepared for me to do that? 
        
        A. Can’t understand that writing. 
        
        Q.20 You can’t? 
        
        A. I can’t understand that writing. 
        
        Q.21 Are you quite happy for me to read those questions and answers to you? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q.22 Well what I’ve got written there is your, twelve twenty five a.m. at the house where you were, then your name. You gave an address of seven Hammond Street Goodooga. Right and your girlfriends name. Then my introduction to you and as I told you I am inquiring into the death of Sandra Hoare and I gave you a caution that you didn’t have to answer any questions unless you wanted to as anything you did say may later be used in evidence. Did you understand that? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q.23 And you said, ‘Yeah’. I said I told you, sorry, ‘I have been told that you were in town with Vester Fernando early yesterday morning. Do you want to say anything about that?’ 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q.24 And you said, ‘No I only got here this morning. I said, ‘Is Vesta your brother.’ You said, ‘No my cousin.’ I said, ‘I’ve been told you were seen with a machete near Fings house.’ You said, ‘No.’ I said, Did you go to the hospital yesterday morning about 3am.’ You said, ‘No I didn’t get here until 7am. 7 o’clock I should say.’ I said, ‘Is Vesta in Walgett at the moment.’ You said, ‘No he’s in Brewarrina at a drying out centre.’ I said, ‘I have been told you are, sorry, I’ve been told that you have been identified by four people in Walgett after midnight yesterday what do you say about that.’ You said, ‘I only went there to get the car.’ I said, ‘What happened then.’ You said, ‘I looked in through a window and said there’s a sheila there.’ I said, ‘What happened then.’ ‘Vesta grabbed her and I said what are you fucking doing man.’ I said, ‘Did you assault the old man.’ You said, ‘No, he told me to hold onto the girl and he hit the old man.’ I said, ‘What happened then.’ And you said, ‘He took her and started going scrub.’ I said, ‘Did you have sex with the girl.’ You said, ‘No I already had sex. Vesta had sex, had it with her.’ I said, ‘Were you there when he had sex with her.’ You said, ‘Yeah. I said, ‘What happened to her underpants.’ You said, ‘He took them.’ I said, ‘What happened to her bra.’ You said, ‘He took them too. He put them in his pocket.’ I said, ‘Who hit the woman with the machete.’ You said, ‘He did I had my back turned walking away.’ I said, ‘Did you see him hit her.’ You said, ‘No I heard her screaming but.’ I said, ‘Did you try and stop him.’ You said, ‘He was the man in control he had the blade.’ I said, ‘Where did he get the machete.’ You said, ‘Near the church under a building.’ I said, ‘Where did he carry it. You said up his sleeve. He had scissors taped, tapped to his shoulder too.’ This shoulder and you pointed to your left shoulder. Is that correct? 
        
        A. Mmmm. 
        
        Q.25 I said, ‘W[h]ere you carrying a screw driver.’ You said, ‘No.’ I said, ‘How did you smash the car window?’ You said, ‘Vesta did that with a machete. With the machete I should say.’ I said, ‘W[h]ere you drinking yesterday’ You said, “I was pretty full I’d been drinking all day.’ I said, ‘You seem to be able to recall everything though.’ You said, ‘How could you forget it. It was bad.’ I said, ‘Was Vesta drinking.’ You said, ‘No he didn’t look it.’ Is that all correct? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q.26 Are you prepared to sign that? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q.27 To say its correct? 
        
        A. Yes.” 
        
       He was then asked whether he wanted to be interviewed any further about what he said and his response was  
       “I can’t handle the pressure”. 
        The conversation that had earlier taken place, immediately before the electronically recorded interview began, seemingly prompted the following exchange as recorded: 
        
         
       “Q.30 …Do you agree that I asked you earlier if you were prepared to show us where you threw, where Vester threw the machete? 
        
        A. Mmm. 
        
        Q.31 Are you still prepared to do that? 
        
        A. Mm. 
        
        Q.32 And are you prepared to show us where you went um when you went to break into the car early yesterday morning at that hospital. 
        
        A. You want me to take you back up there. 
        
        Q.33 Yeah. 
        
        A. No. ____________ 
        
        Q.34 Hey? 
        
        A. No. 
        
        Q.35 Then you could show us where you went at the hospital and where you went with the girl. Not prepared to do that. 
        
        A. No I couldn’t do that. 
        
        Q.36 Okay, well are you prepared to show where Vesta threw the machete. 
        
        A. Yeah.” 
        
       (iv) Immediately following the suspension of that interview, Sgt Pollock asked the appellant, in words not recorded:  
       “Listen, why don’t you show us where you went up at the car, eh?” 
        He agreed in cross-examination that he said that to the appellant in an endeavour  
       “to have him change his mind” 
        concerning his refusal, expressed in the electronically recorded interview, in his responses to questions 32-35. 
        
       (v) The runaround between 2.20 am and 2.53 am: In the course of the runaround that followed the suspension of the ERISP the appellant took part in a conversation which was recorded on a tape recorder and the events were also recorded on video. The record concerning that runaround begins: 
        
         
       “Q.1 Now Brendan. Do you agree I just spoke to you a little while ago that um we are going to now go and you are going to show me where Vester threw the machete? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q.2 Yes. Do you agree that I asked you whether you agreed with having our conversation during this trip recorded on a tape recorder? 
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
        Q.3 And do you agree with having it done that way? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q.4 And do you understand that on our trip along this way um I will have to ask you some questions? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q.5 Now I want you to understand that you don’t have to answer any of those questions or say anything unless you wish but whatever you do say will be recorded and later given in evidence. Do you understand that? 
        
        A. Yes.” 
        
       During the runaround, and having shown the police where the machete had been thrown and  
       “buried by Vester” 
       , the appellant gave the following answers to the following questions: 
        
         
       “Q.70 Will you just to me again where Vester took the girls pants off. Underpants? 
        
        A.. Under a tree near No. 2 oval. 
        
        Q.71 And had he assaulted her in any way at that point? 
        
        A. No he didn’t. No. 
        
        Q.72 Did she walk with him to the tree at No. 2 oval? 
        
        A. Yeah. Cause she had no other choice. 
        
        Q.73 Why didn’t she have any other choice?

        Q.74 So was he dragging her at all? 
        
        A. No she co-operated and that and we could lead her. 
        
        Q.75 Which way do we go now? 
        
        A. Keep going. 
        
        Q.76 And where did he take her bra off? 
        
        A. At the same place where he took her pants off. 
        
        Q.77 And then after he took the bra and pants off, what did he do then? 
        
        A. He told her to lay down. She laid down. 
        
        Q.78 Yeah. What happened then?

        Q.79 Did you hold them? 
        
        A. I had no other choice so I grabbed them. 
        
        …… 
        
        Q.85 Okay. Now um. You held her legs. Did he had sexual intercourse with her? 
        
        A. Yeah.

       (vi) The ERISP resumed at 2.53 am after the appellant had been taken back to the police station and it was suspended again at 2.58 am. In this period the appellant expressed his willingness to show police the clothing he had been wearing when he went to the Walgett hospital. 
        
       (vii) The ERISP resumed briefly between 3.02 and 3.04 am during which time the appellant acknowledged to Sgt Holland that he had answered the earlier questions of his own free will and that he had no complaints as to the manner in which he had been treated. 
        
       (viii) The appellant was formally charged at about 3.20 or 3.25 am. 
        
       (ix) At about 5.50 am the appellant accompanied two police officers to Dewhurst Street to point out the house in which Vester Fernando was staying. 
        
       (x) After 7.00 am the appellant accompanied Sgt Pollack to the No. 2 oval where he was asked whether that was the area where the deceased had been sexually assaulted. He said that it was. 
       
      
     22  
     It was submitted by Mr Buddin that the trial judge was in error in allowing the evidence of admissions to go before the jury. A number of reasons for this submission were advanced. They were of course more fully expressed, but in essence the argument for the exclusion of the admissions was as follows: 
      
       
       (i) that as the ERISP records (in the response to questions 10 and 11), the appellant made it clear he did not want to be electronically interviewed; 
        
       (ii) the assertion of compulsion advanced by Sgt Pollock to justify that interview was incorrect and in any event the interview continued past the point to which Sgt Pollock understood he was compelled to proceed, which was to identify on the recording the appellant’s name and his unwillingness to be further interviewed; 
        
       (iii) the appellant’s participation in the runaround was against his will in so far as it extended beyond showing where the machete had been thrown; 
        
       (iv) the appellant was not formally charged until approximately 3.20 am although Sgt Pollock had made up his mind to charge him at about 1.00 am once he had admitted in the notebook interview that he went with Vester to steal the car; 
        
       (v) other factors calling for the exclusion of the evidence were advanced: 
        
        (a) the period of interrogation; 
        
        (b) the appellant’s vulnerability by reason of his 
         
       age, his background and social status, his eduction and intelligence, his distress and his intellectual disability; 
        
        (c) Sgt Pollock’s failure to comply with the Police Commissioner’s instructions: 
        
        (i) failing to inform the appellant whether he was under arrest or not before accompanying him to the police station; 
        
         
          (ii) failing to inform him at about 1.00 am that he was under arrest and for what reason; 
          
          (iii) persisting with the interrogation after the appellant had conveyed his unwillingness to be further questioned; 
          
          (d) the failure to inform the appellant that he could 
           
         contact a lawyer, a relative, a friend or a member of an Aboriginal organisation. 
         
        
       
      
     23  
     The issue of admissibility that arose for the trial judge involved consideration of ss 84 and 85 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      as well as the discretionary provisions of ss 90 and 138 of the Act. (The appellant relied upon the lastmentioned provision at the trial for the exclusion of the admissions made on the “runaround” after the police had been taken to where the machete had been thrown. Hence the objection covered those passages extracted above from the tape recording and the video that related to it.) 
      
     24  
     Section 84 imposed on the Crown a positive burden of satisfying the court that the admissions were not influenced by: 
      
       
     “(a) violent, oppressive, inhuman or degrading conduct…, or 
      
       
        (b) a threat of conduct of that kind.” 
       
      
     25  
     There was no evidence to suggest that any violence or threat of violence was proffered in this case but the trial judge was obliged to satisfy himself that the admissions were not influenced by oppressive conduct. It is plain from his Honour’s lengthy reasons for judgment following the voir dire proceedings that he was so satisfied in this case; indeed his Honour expressly found that this was so. His Honour also addressed the discretionary considerations that arose under ss 90 and 138 before deciding to admit the evidence. 
      
     26  
     His Honour made a number of significant findings of fact on the evidence introduced on the voir dire: 
      
       
        
         
         (i) the appellant voluntarily accompanied Sgt Pollock to the police station after being informed that the police officer was making inquiries into the death of the nurse at the hospital the previous morning; 
          
         (ii) based on prior experience with the police the appellant understood the meaning of police cautions such as he was given on 10 December before the “notebook” interview, at the ERISP interview and later on the runaround; 
          
         (iii) the appellant was aware of his right to remain silent; 
          
         (iv) whilst Sgt Pollock should have informed the appellant as soon as he formed the requisite state of mind, the appellant appreciated from prior dealings and experience that he was under arrest once he told the police officer he went to the hospital  
         “to get the car” 
         ; 
          
         (v) that Sgt Pollock believed that the appellant appreciated he was under arrest as from 1.00 am and that there was no deliberate breach of the law or recklessness in the police officer’s conduct in the sense explained in  
         Foster v The Queen 
          67 ALJR 550 at 565; 
          
         (vi) that Sgt Pollock did believe he was compelled by police instructions to undertake an electronic interview even in a case where the person to be interviewed was unwilling to participate; 
          
         (vii) that the appellant signed what was written in the notebook voluntarily; 
          
         (viii) that Sgt Pollock regarded the essential purpose of the runaround to be undertaken as being to locate the machete, although he had in mind he would converse with the appellant and that the conversation would be recorded; 
          
         (ix) that the appellant knew what was said on the runaround was being recorded and that the appellant had agreed to this occurring; 
          
         (x) that the appellant was not taken on the runaround to places he objected to but taken some distance away from them; 
          
         (xi) that the appellant agreed to accompany police to the No. 2 oval on the visit that occurred later that morning and that he received an appropriate caution concerning that visit; 
          
         (xii) that the various admissions that were made were reliable and probative; 
          
         (xiii) that the appellant was treated with consideration and respect by the police officers concerned; 
          
         (xiv) that Dr Trindall, Constable Mayes and Constable Gilmour had observed no intellectual impairment in their dealings with the appellant and that the appellant’s admissions were not rendered unreliable by any such disability. 
         
        
       
      
     27  
     The above findings of fact were in our opinion open to his Honour and Mr Buddin’s submission to the contrary, in relation to such findings as he did challenge, is rejected. These findings all represented relevant considerations in his Honour’s task in determining whether the evidence should be admitted. 
      
     28  
     The Court does not accept the submission that his Honour applied the wrong test in considering the requirements of s 84. On the contrary, a reading of his judgment discloses that he addressed those matters relevant to the issue upon which the submissions focussed: namely whether the admissions were influenced by  
     “oppressive conduct” 
     . 
      
     29  
     In addressing ss 90 and 138 Mr Buddin referred to  
     R v Swaffield 
      (1997-98) 192 CLR 159 and drew attention in particular to the passage in the joint judgment of Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 202 which is relevant to the discretionary exercise: 
      
       
     “However, the notion of compulsion is not an integral part of the fairness discretion and it plays no part in the policy discretion. In the light of recent decisions of this Court, it is no great step to recognise, as the Canadian Supreme Court has done, an approach which looks to the accused’s freedom to choose to speak to the police and the extent to which that freedom has been impugned. Where the freedom has been impugned the court has a discretion to reject the evidence. In deciding whether to exercise that discretion, which is a discretion to exclude not to admit, the court will look at all the circumstances. Those circumstances may point to unfairness to the accused if the confession is admitted. There may be no unfairness involved but the court may consider that, having regard to the means by which the confession was elicited, the evidence has been obtained at a price which is unacceptable having regard to prevailing community standards. This invests a broad discretion in the court...” 
      
     30  
     A court addressing issues such as arise in the present case must be vigilant to ensure that evidence is not permitted to be introduced at an unacceptable price. 
      
     31  
     The findings that his Honour made and which we have recorded warrant consideration in relation to the issues arising under each of the statutory provisions, ss 84, 90 and 138. 
      
     32  
     It is always a matter of degree as to whether police questioning has gone too far, recognising the duty of the investigating police officer on the one hand and the right of the suspect on the other hand. 
      
     33  
     In the judgment of this Court in  
     R v Plevac 
      (1995) 84 A Crim R 570 it was said (at 580): 
      
       
     “Police should not persist with such an interrogation after the suspect has indicated that he or she does not wish to answer further questions: Ireland (1970) 126 CLR 321 at 331-332; although merely because a suspect says he does not wish to answer, or will not answer, any further questions does not render inadmissible answers to further questions which the suspect does answer provided the questions are fair and proper and the answers are otherwise admissible.” 
      
     34  
     Then in  
     R v Clarke 
      (1997) 97 A Crim R 414 Hunt CJ at CL, with whose judgment the other members of the court agreed, said at 419: 
      
       
     “It should be kept in mind that a police officer is under a duty to ascertain the facts which bear upon the commission of a crime, whether from the suspect or not, and the officer is not bound to accept the first answer given; questioning is not to be regarded as unfair merely because it is persistent (Smith [1964] VR 95 at 97; Lavery (No. 2) (1979) 20 SASR 430 at 470; O’Neill (1988) 48 SASR 51 at 56). It is a question of degree as to whether persistence has crossed the line so as to render it unfair to use the answers in evidence (cf Wilson at 324).” 
      
     35  
     In this case the admissions recorded at the electronic interview had already been made in the notebook interview. That earlier interview took place before s 424A of the  
     Crimes Act  
     required tape recording of an interview at which an admission was made before evidence of the admission could be introduced. Moreover the appellant had before the electronic interview already agreed to take the police to where the machete had been disposed of, and to accompany police to the scene provided he did not go  
     “too close” 
      to where it happened. 
      
     36  
     The manner in which the police officers behaved towards and communicated with the appellant warranted the closest scrutiny in considering this ground. This Court was invited to and has had the benefit of seeing and listening to the electronic interview. It has also seen the video of the “runaround” and heard the accompanying record of what the appellant had to say during the course of that activity. We have already remarked that his Honour accepted that the appellant was treated with consideration and respect and that there was no oppressive behaviour. To the extent that his Honour’s findings were based on the visual and audio material that this Court has seen and heard, we would see no reason to disagree with those findings. We observed no indications of aggression or vigorous questioning or any other indicators of overbearance in the conduct of the police involved. 
      
     37  
     In our opinion the trial judge was correct in the decision he reached in relation to s 84. 
      
     38  
     His Honour found that the admissions were reliable and this finding, plainly open to the judge, bore upon the issue of fairness under s 90. The reliability of the evidence and its importance in the case for the Crown were very relevant considerations in weighing the public interest in allowing the jury to consider such evidence. Having reflected upon all the submissions made by Mr Buddin, we do not consider that error has been demonstrated in the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge under either s 90 or s 138. 
      
     39  
     In our opinion the evidence was properly allowed at the trial and this ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
     Ground 2: The trial judge erred in allowing evidence to be given by David Doolan, Bruce Scott and Derek Pitt in the Crown case against Brendan Fernando. 
      
     40  
     Each of these three witnesses gave evidence of having observed the appellant’s co-accused, Vester Fernando, with a machete on occasions before 9 December 1994. 
      
     41  
     At an early stage of the trial, before the Crown Prosecutor made his opening address, counsel for Vester Fernando informed the trial judge that he would object to evidence of this kind being given, on the grounds that it was merely evidence of a propensity on the part of Vester Fernando to carry large knives. Counsel for Brendan Fernando stated that he would object to evidence of this kind, on the grounds that it was irrelevant to the trial of his client. The trial judge, however, made a ruling that the Crown Prosecutor should be permitted to refer to the evidence in question in his opening address. When Mr Doolan, the first of the three witnesses to be called, was giving evidence in the Crown case, both defence counsel repeated their objections to evidence of the kind in question being given. The trial judge held that such evidence would be admissible as against both of the accused. 
      
     42  
     On the hearing of the appeal it was submitted on behalf of Brendan Fernando that evidence that his co-accused had been seen with a machete, on occasions when Brendan Fernando was not present, was not admissible against Brendan Fernando. 
      
     43  
     We do not consider that this submission should be upheld. The Crown case against each appellant included that he had been a party to a joint enterprise with the other appellant, in which Vester Fernando had used a particular kind of weapon, a machete. Evidence that in the recent past before the night of 8 and 9 December 1994, Vester Fernando had been observed in possession of a machete was relevant, not only in the trial of Vester Fernando but also in the trial of Brendan Fernando, as showing that on the night of 8 and 9 December 1994 Vester Fernando had available to him a machete. Such evidence was admissible for this purpose against Brendan Fernando, regardless of whether Brendan Fernando had been present on the occasions when Vester Fernando was observed having a machete in his possession. As Brendan Fernando had not been present on these occasions, such evidence did not show that Brendan Fernando had been aware, on or prior to the night of 8 and 9 December 1994, that Vester Fernando had a machete. Nevertheless, the evidence was relevant to prove the matter which we have indicated. 
      
     44  
     We consider that this ground of appeal should be rejected. 
      
       
     Ground 3: The trial judge erred in granting leave to the Crown to cross-examine its own witness, Michael Jackson, pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act. 
      
     45  
     We note that this ground of appeal is the same as the first part of ground of appeal 5 (d) in Vester Fernando's appeal, that:- 
      
       
     ""The trial judge erred in his conduct of the trial in:- 
      
       
        (d) allowing the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine the witness Michael Jackson in chief...” 
       
      
     46  
     The argument put in support of this ground of appeal in the written submissions by counsel for Brendan Fernando was that the Crown had been on notice that Michael Jackson, if called, would not give evidence in accordance with the statement he had given to the police and that it was impermissible for the Crown to call a witness who it knows would, if called, give evidence which would be inconsistent with a prior statement made by the witness, for the purpose of enabling the Crown to obtain leave under s 38 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      to cross-examine the witness, to cross-examine the witness on the witness's prior inconsistent statement and then to rely on the evidence of the prior inconsistent statement as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted in the prior inconsistent statement. 
      
     47  
     This argument was not pressed in oral argument at the hearing of the appeal. It was conceded that a key step in the argument, that the Crown was on notice, before Michael Jackson was called, that he would not give evidence in accordance with his statement, depended on the drawing of an inference to that effect from two parts of the trial transcript, a part where the Crown Prosecutor is recorded as saying, "" 
     I notify my learned friends that I would be seeking leave to take a particular course 
     "" and the part where the court reporter summarised something said by the Crown Prosecutor as "" 
     (Crown Prosecutor indicated that he had given notice of the situation as soon as he had been informed by his instructing solicitor that there may be a problem 
     )"". 
      
     48  
     As to the first part of the transcript the argument for the appellant depended on reading the word which actually appears in the transcript as "" 
     notify 
     "" as being an error for "" 
     notified 
     "", so that the transcript would read "" 
     I notified my learned friends that I would be seeking leave to take a particular course 
     "". 
      
     49  
     It was conceded by counsel for Brendan Fernando at the hearing of the appeal that these ""cryptic"" parts of the transcript did not form a safe foundation for the drawing of the desired inference of the Crown being on notice before it called Michael Jackson and the argument that the Crown had called Michael Jackson for an impermissible purpose was not pressed. 
      
     50  
     It is noteworthy that the trial judge in a judgment of 4 June 1997 concerning Michael Jackson's evidence said that the evidence given by Michael Jackson in his evidence-in-chief (before leave was given to the Crown to cross-examine) that he had smoked marijuana, left the appellants and gone home, "" 
     came quite clearly as a surprise to the Crown"". 
      
     51  
     It was still submitted on the appeal that the trial judge had erred in granting leave to the Crown to cross-examine Michael Jackson but no ground for impugning his Honour's decision was really advanced. There was a clear basis for granting leave to cross-examine, in that Michael Jackson had made a prior statement which was inconsistent with the evidence he had given. When the application was made at the trial, counsel for Brendan Fernando said that he had nothing to say in opposition to the Crown Prosecutor's application and the only submission which counsel for Vester Fernando is recorded as making was that the trial judge was obliged to take into account whether the Crown Prosecutor had given notice at the earliest opportunity of his intention to seek leave (s 38 (6) (a)) and it was put that the earliest opportunity had been ""about 5, 6 minutes ago"". The trial judge said that in reaching his decision to grant leave he had taken s 38 (6) into account and it was clearly open to the trial judge to consider that the Crown Prosecutor's application had been made at the earliest reasonable opportunity. 
      
     52  
     Reference was made in submissions to the decision of the High Court in 
      Lee v The Queen  
     72 ALJR 1484. In  
     Lee  
     leave had been given to the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine the Crown witness Calin pursuant to s 38 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     . However, the only question which the High Court addressed on the appeal to that court was the extent of the operation of s 60 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     . As regards s 38, 
      Lee 
      is in any event distinguishable from the present case on its facts, because in 
      Lee 
      the witness Calin had told police before 
      Lee 
     's trial that he was not willing to give evidence in accordance with the statement he had given to police, because he had heard that he was being called a  
     ""dog"". 
      
     53  
     We would dismiss this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     Ground 4 
     :  
     The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence that material from the witness Michael Jackson which appears at the trial transcript pages 496-500. 
      
     54  
     The evidence given by Michael Jackson at pp 496-500 of the trial transcript was the evidence given by him during cross-examination by the Crown. It is desirable to set out his cross-examination in full:

        Q. Then you said ‘The machete was actually tucked inside his track pants that he was wearing and was covered over the top by the shirt.’ A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said ‘I can’t remember anything else about the track pants because I didn’t pay attention to them.’ A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said ‘The blade was silver and black in colour and was about this long.’ A. Yes. 
        
        Q. You indicated about 20 to 30 centimetres? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said ‘The blade was straight but it curved around towards the end.’ A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said ‘I didn’t see the handle of the machete.’ A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then in par 8 you said ‘Vester then went on to say ‘If anyone grabs you I’ll kill them.’ A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said ‘I didn’t say anything in reply but Brendan said, ‘We will go up to the top end. There should be some good cars up there.’ A. Yes. 
        
        Q. And the top end was where the hospital was, was it not, and the airport, is that right.? A. Yes. 
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Vester said, ‘When we steal the car, we’re going to go up to Queensland. We’ll be right, Mick, I’ve got people up there’? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said, ‘We then started walking off along Fox Street towards the top end of the town which is where the hospital and the airport is’? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said, ‘Vester then said, we are going home to get a jumper first, do you want one’? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said, ‘I said, no, I will be right’? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said, ‘We then turned left into Sutherland Street and kept walking down to Peel Street where we turned right and walked down to the corner of Peel and Dewhurst Street’? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said, ‘Vester walked into his sister, Wendy Fernando’s house on the corner’? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said, ‘I know Vester stays there because I have been to the house before and seen him staying there’? A. Yes 
        
        Q. Then you said, ‘While we were walking along, Vester and Brendan were talking, but I wasn’t listening to what they were saying’? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Paragraph nine: Then you said, ‘When Vester walked into the house I kept walking down to Dewhurst to Cynthia Hickey’s house which is only two houses down from Wendy Fernando’s’? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said, ‘I just wanted to get away from Vester and Brendan because I didn’t want to get involved with them in stealing the car’? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said, ‘I just jumped the back fence of Cynthia’s place and walked the back way home to Dundas Street’, is that correct? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said, ‘The back way, I mean back across Dewhurst through some paddocks, a church on the corner of Sutherland Street, then through some flats before walking up Arthur Street? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Then you said, ‘I arrived at about 1 am so it would have been about twelve midnight when I last saw Vester and Brendan’? A. Yes.

        OBJECTION BY MR WENDLER. 
        
        WENDLER: This has never been an area which he went into in examination in-chief. He has never given the witness an opportunity to give evidence about this. 
        
        HIS HONOUR: I withdraw that question. 
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. You said, Michael, that you had seen Vester Brendan coming out of the laneway opposite the tyre service? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. You said you spoke with them? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. And did you notice anything about them, about their sobriety? A. Yes. 
        
        Q. What did you notice? A. They were a bit drunk, they were staggering a bit. 
        
        Q. What about when they were talking to you, could you understand what they were saying? A. Yes.” 
       
      
     55  
     This ground of appeal in Brendan Fernando's appeal comprehended within it a more limited ground of appeal in Vester Fernando's appeal (Ground 5(e)):- 
      
       
     ""The trial judge erred in his conduct of the trial in-: 
      
       
        (e) admitting into evidence the representation that Jackson heard the appellant (Vester Fernando) say, 'If anyone grabs you, I'll kill them 
       ' "". 
       
      
     56  
     The trial judge directed the jury that the evidence of what Michael Jackson had said in his statement to the police which was elicited in this cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, was not merely evidence of prior inconsistent statements by Michael Jackson which could be used by the jury in assessing the credibility of Michael Jackson's evidence but could be used as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted in the statement. 
      
     57  
     The principal submission made by counsel for Brendan Fernando in support of this ground was sought to be based on the decision of the High Court in 
      Lee v The Queen 
     . In 
      Lee 
     , the Crown was permitted to adduce evidence that the Crown witness Calin had made a statement to the police in which he had said that he had had a chance meeting with Lee and that Lee had said, inter alia,  
     ""Leave me alone, cause I'm running, because I fired two shots... I 
       
     did a job and the other guy was with me bailed out"" 
     . It will be observed that what Lee said to Calin was a report by Lee of past events of which Calin had no knowledge. The High Court held that this evidence of what Calin had said he had been told by Lee was evidence only that Lee had said those things to Calin and that that was all that Calin had intended to assert in the statement he had made to the police, and was not evidence that Lee had in fact fired two shots or had done a job or that the person with him had bailed out, matters which Calin had no way of knowing and which he had not intended to assert as being facts. The High Court went on to say at paragraph 41:- 
      
       
     “Evidence of Mr Calin’s prior statements of what the appellant had said should not have been admitted as evidence of the truth of the confession allegedly made by him to Mr Calin. Because those prior statements of what the appellant had said went only to Mr Calin’s credit, the trial judge could either have rejected those parts of the statements or, if that course was not followed, would have had to give clear directions to the jury about the very limited use to which they could be put. In the circumstances of this case, the former course was to be preferred”. 
      
     58  
     It was submitted that the High Court's reasoning in 
      Lee 
      was applicable to the present case, that the evidence by Michael Jackson of what Vester Fernando had said in the presence of Brendan Fernando went only to Michael Jackson's credit and that the preferable course would have been for the trial judge to have rejected this evidence. 
      
     59  
     We do not consider that this submission should be accepted. In the first place much of the evidence given at pp 496-500 of the trial transcript was not evidence of anything said by Vester Fernando but evidence of what Michael Jackson did or observed. 
      
     60  
     In the second place, the evidence of what Vester Fernando said, with the exception of the evidence that Vester Fernando said, 
      ""I 
       
     have got a machete here"", 
      was not sought to be relied on by the Crown as evidence of the truth of facts asserted by Vester Fernando in what he said but was sought to be relied on by the Crown simply as evidence of what Vester Fernando had said, of which Michael Jackson did have direct knowledge. From the evidence of what Vester Fernando said, the jury would be asked to infer that Vester Fernando and Brendan Fernando were about to embark on a criminal venture together and that Vester Fernando had a state of mind such that he would be prepared, in certain contingencies, to use a machete he had, to the extent of killing someone with the machete. The evidence was relevant, otherwise than as merely going to the credit of Michael Jackson. So far as the assertion by Vester Fernando that he had a machete is concerned, this was strongly confirmed by Michael Jackson's evidence in his statement that he had seen Vester Fernando carrying what looked to Michael Jackson like a machete and that he could describe the colour, length and curvature of what he had seen. 
      
     61  
     It was submitted, at least by counsel for Vester Fernando, that the evidence by Michael Jackson that Vester Fernando had said,  
     ""If anyone grabs you, I'll kill them"" 
      should have been excluded by the trial judge in the exercise of his discretion under s 137 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     . However, in our opinion, the trial judge did not err in considering that this evidence of what Vester Fernando had said with respect to the machete he was carrying, shortly before the crimes charged were allegedly committed, was highly probative as indicating Vester Fernando's then state of mind and should not have been excluded as a matter of discretion. 
      
     62  
     We would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     Ground 5: 
       
     The trial judge erred in not limiting the use that could be made of the evidence of Michael Jackson. 
      
     63  
     The evidence of Michael Jackson referred to in this ground of appeal was, again, the evidence given by Michael Jackson in cross-examination by the Crown, which the trial judge told the jury could be used by them as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted in the statement made by Michael Jackson to the police. 
      
     64  
     This ground of appeal comprehended within it ground of appeal 5 (f) in Vester Fernando's appeal that: - 
      
       
     ""The trial judge erred in his conduct of the trial 
      
       
        (f) in failing to direct the jury how they might use the representation (that Jackson heard the appellant (Vester Fernando) say, 'If anybody grabs you I'll kill them'), if they were satisfied to the requisite standard that it was made"". 
       
      
     65  
     After the Crown case had been closed at the trial, counsel for Brendan Fernando made a number of applications, including an application that the use to which the evidence of Michael Jackson's previous representations could be put should be limited, that is limited to being used in the assessment of Michael Jackson's credibility as a witness. The trial judge rejected this application, because he considered the evidence of what Michael Jackson had said to the police to be highly probative and likely to be more reliable than the version Michael Jackson had given in court. 
      
     66  
     As in the case of the previous ground of appeal, counsel for Brendan Fernando relied on the decision of the High Court in 
      Lee v The Queen 
     . It was submitted that the reasoning of the High Court in 
      Lee 
      was applicable to the present case and if what the High Court had described as the preferable course of rejecting the evidence of the previous representations was not adopted, then at least the trial judge should have limited the use to which the evidence of Michael Jackson's previous representations could be put. For the reasons we have already given in rejecting the fourth ground of appeal, we consider that the reasoning of the High Court in 
      Lee 
      is not applicable to the present case and hence the submission presently being considered should also be rejected. In our opinion, no error has been shown in his Honour's decision to reject the application made at the trial that the use to which Michael Jackson's evidence could be put should be limited. The trial judge was entitled to hold that the evidence could be regarded as reliable and probative of a state of mind on the part of Vester Fernando shortly before the offences charged were allegedly committed, which had been exhibited in the presence of Brendan Fernando. 
      
     67  
     We would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     Ground 6 
     :  
     The trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to re-examine Michael Jackson with respect to matters which had emerged in cross-examination of him at the committal hearing. 
      
     68  
     This ground of appeal is substantially the same as part of ground of appeal 5(d) in Vester Fernando's appeal, which was:- 
      
       
     ""The trial judge erred in the conduct of the trial in:- 
      
       
        (d) allowing the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine the witness Michael Jackson... in re-examination"". 
       
      
     69  
     The part of the re-examination of Michael Jackson upon which this ground of appeal was based is the part relating to the questions asked by the Crown and the answers given by Michael Jackson about evidence Michael Jackson had given in the committal proceedings when cross-examined by Vester Fernando's legal representative, including that Michael Jackson had said at the committal proceedings that he had not been worried or concerned about going to the police station. 
      
     70  
     It was submitted that the questions asked by the Crown Prosecutor were leading questions and really amounted to further cross-examination; that the evidence of what Michael Jackson had said at the committal proceedings was of dubious value, because, it was submitted, something was sought by the Crown to be read into the questions as well as the answers and it was not known what instructions Mr Coe had been given; it was not known what the context at the committal proceedings was, in which the evidence had been given; and that caution should be exercised in permitting evidence to be adduced at a trial of what had been said by a witness at a committal proceeding, because of the different purposes of the two kinds of proceedings; and that the evidence in re-examination did not in fact meet the issue which had arisen in cross-examination (whether at the police station Michael Jackson had been afraid of being charged with an offence, because the evidence in re-examination related to ""going"" to the police station). It was submitted that there was ""a temporal and strategic difference"" between going to a police station and being at a police station. It was submitted that defence counsel at the trial should have been given an opportunity of further cross-examining Michael Jackson. 
      
     71  
     We do not consider that any of these submissions should be upheld. The questions asked in re-examination were not objected to by either defence counsel at the trial. There was no issue about what Michael Jackson had said in his evidence in the committal proceedings and it was appropriate, and did not cause any prejudice, for the evidence of what he had said to be elicited by leading questions. What the Crown relied on were the answers given by Michael Jackson that he had not been worried or concerned about going to the police station, and not the questions asked by Mr Coe or what instructions Mr Coe might have received. If the context in which the evidence had been given in the committal proceedings had been of any importance, then either defence counsel at the trial could have applied to ask further questions of Michael Jackson but neither counsel made any such application. We do not see how the different purpose of committal proceedings prevented evidence of what Michael Jackson had said in the committal proceedings from having probative value at the trial. Evidence that Michael Jackson had not been concerned about going to the police station was, in our opinion, at least relevant to determining what his state of mind had been at the police station. Moreover, the evidence given in re-examination did directly meet part of Michael Jackson's evidence given in cross-examination, that when he was asked by a police officer to go to the police station, he had thought that he was under arrest. 
      
     72  
     We would reject this ground of appeal.  
      
      Ground 7 
     :  
     The learned trial judge erred in declining to give the jury a warning pursuant to s165 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      as to the potential unreliability of the evidence of Michael Jackson. 
      
     73  
     This ground of appeal is comprehended within ground of appeal 6(c) in the appeal of Vester Fernando: the learned trial judge erred in his summing up to the jury in: (c) his directions to the jury concerning the witness Michael Jackson and his evidence. 
      
     74  
     Michael Jackson was called as a witness by the Crown. Initially in his evidence in chief he gave some evidence about what had happened on the night of 8 December 1994, which was in accordance with the statement he had made to the police on 11 December 1994. He then gave evidence that, after meeting the two appellants, he had smoked marijuana with them and had then gone home. This evidence was not included in his statement and was inconsistent with what he had said in his statement. 
      
     75  
     The Crown Prosecutor successfully applied for leave, pursuant to s 38 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     , to cross-examine Michael Jackson, on the basis that he had made a prior inconsistent statement. The Crown Prosecutor then cross-examined Michael Jackson on the statement he had made to the police on 11 December 1994 and elicited from Michael Jackson that he had in fact said to the police what was recorded in his statement. The Crown Prosecutor did not ask Michael Jackson whether what he had said in his statement was true. 
      
     76  
     Michael Jackson was then cross-examined by counsel for Brendan Fernando and in this cross-examination denied that a number of things alleged in his statement had actually happened, including a number of things which in his statement he had alleged had been said to him by Vester Fernando. In further cross-examination by counsel for each appellant Michael Jackson said that when making the statement to the police he had “made up”, that is invented, a number of things, because he was afraid of being charged by the police with having been a “cockatoo” for the two appellants.  
      
     77  
     In re-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, Michael Jackson accepted that, when cross-examined by Vester Fernando’s legal representative at the committal proceedings, he had agreed with a suggestion put to him that he had not been worried about going to the police station on the occasion on which he had made the statement. 
      
     78  
     At the trial the only application that the trial judge give the jury a warning pursuant to s 165 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      in relation to any part of the evidence of Michael Jackson, was made by counsel for Brendan Fernando. No such application was made by counsel for Vester Fernando. The application by counsel for Brendan Fernando was made during a break early in the summing up, after the trial judge had given the jury general directions about the assessment of witnesses, in the course of which his Honour had referred at some length to the evidence of Michael Jackson. 
      
     79  
     During argument on the application counsel for Brendan Fernando expressly limited the application to an application that a warning by given, only in relation to the parts of Michael Jackson’s evidence in which he gave evidence that in his statement made to the police he had said that Vester Fernando had said to him on the night of 8 December 1994:-  
     “Don’t worry about anyone grabbing you Mick, I’ve got a machete here… if anyone grabs you, I’ll kill 
       
     them”. 
      In the rest of this part of our judgment we will refer to this evidence as “the subject evidence”. 
      
     80  
     The grounds of the application made by counsel for Brendan Fernando were that the evidence of what Michael Jackson had said in his statement to the police was hearsay, that the evidence accordingly fell within para (a) of s 165(1) and there were matters which might cause the evidence to be unreliable, including that Michael Jackson in his sworn evidence in court at the trial had given an inconsistent account and, while accepting that he had said what was recorded in the statement, had testified that much of what he had said in his statement, including what Vester Fernando had allegedly said, had been “made up” by him. 
      
     81  
     It is convenient at this stage to set out the provisions of s 165 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     , so far as they are relevant. The section provides:- 
      
       
     “(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind which may be unreliable including the following kinds of evidence:- 
      
       
        (a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies, 
        
         
          … 
         
        
        (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding, 
        
         
          … 
         
        
        (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to: 
        
        (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and 
        
        (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 
        
        (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
        
        (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so. 
        
        (4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information. 
        
        (5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury” 
       
      
     82  
     The application made by counsel for Brendan Fernando for a warning pursuant to s 165 was refused by the trial judge. In his judgment the trial judge said that he accepted the submissions which had been made by the Crown Prosecutor on the hearing of the application. These submissions by the Crown Prosecutor included a submission that the subject evidence was not hearsay but  
     “direct evidence under s 60”, 
      that is the evidence did not fall within para (a) of s 165(1), and a submission that Michael Jackson was not an “accomplice”, that is his evidence did not fall within para (d) of s 165(1). These submissions made by the Crown Prosecutor furnished the primary ground for his Honour’s conclusion that he should refuse the application. However, his Honour added, as an alternative ground for his conclusion, that in his opinion there were good reasons for not giving the direction requested. In saying this, his Honour was clearly adverting to sub-s (3) of s 165. 
      
     83  
     On the hearing of this appeal senior counsel who appeared for the Crown expressly conceded (transcript of the appeal proceedings pp 116 and 117) that the subject evidence was “clearly hearsay” and that his Honour had been wrong in deciding that the subject evidence did not fall within s 165(1). 
      
     84  
     In holding that the subject evidence was not hearsay, his Honour accepted a submission put to him by the Crown Prosecutor that the subject evidence had become  
     “direct evidence under s 60”. 
      This submission made by the Crown Prosecutor and accepted by the trial judge was clearly incorrect. What Michael Jackson said to the police on 11 December 1994 was a “previous representation”(or representations) made by him within the definition of that expression in Pt 1 of the dictionary at the end of the  
     Evidence Act 
     , that is  
     “a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in a proceeding in which evidence of the 
       
     representation is sought to be adduced”. 
      As such, evidence of it became prima facie subject to the hearsay rule of exclusion under s 59 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     , that evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation. At the trial the Crown Prosecutor obtained leave to cross-examine Michael Jackson and the Crown Prosecutor cross-examined Michael Jackson, and Michael Jackson gave evidence, about what he had said in his statement to the police on 11 December 1994. The evidence of what Michael Jackson had said to the police was admitted, as being a previous statement by Michael Jackson inconsistent with his evidence, which could be used in assessing the credibility of his evidence. In these circumstances, by virtue of s 60 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      the hearsay rule of exclusion did not apply to the evidence of the previous representations made by Michael Jackson to the police, the evidence of the previous representations having been admitted because it was relevant for a purpose other than proof of the facts intended to be asserted by the representations. However, the fact that, by virtue of s 60, the hearsay rule of exclusion did not apply to evidence of the previous representations made by Michael Jackson did not mean that, for the purposes of s 165, the hearsay evidence ceased to be “hearsay” and became “direct” evidence. The evidence continued to be hearsay evidence, even though by way of an exception to the hearsay rule of exclusion, that rule did not apply to it. 
      
     85  
     Another way of reaching the same conclusion, which is based more closely on the actual words used in s 165(1)(a), is to say that the subject evidence was “ 
     evidence in relation to which Pt 3.2… 
       
     applies”. 
      Section 60, on which the Crown Prosecutor and the trial judge relied, is itself included in Pt 3.2 of the Act and hence the subject evidence was  
     clearly “evidence in relation to which Pt 3.2 applies”. 
      
     86  
     The argument put by the Crown Prosecutor and accepted by his Honour, if valid, would have the paradoxical result, that where evidence of a previous representation is admitted for a non-hearsay purpose but by virtue of s 60 is exempted from the hearsay rule of exclusion and thus becomes capable of being used as evidence of facts intended to be asserted in the representation, no warning about its possible unreliability is required by s 165, whereas it is precisely in these circumstances that the evidence, insofar as it is used for a hearsay purpose, may be unreliable.  
      
     87  
     The subject evidence was hearsay, as being evidence of previous out of court representations made by Michael Jackson, irrespective of whether, if Michael Jackson had given evidence in court of the same matters, that evidence should have been regarded as hearsay. 
      
     88  
     It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that, if Michael Jackson had given evidence in court that Vester Fernando had said  
     “don’t worry about anyone grabbing you Mick, I’ve got a machete 
       
     here” 
      and that Vester Fernando had said  
     “if anyone grabs you I’ll kill them”, 
      that evidence would have been hearsay, as being evidence of previous out of court representations made by Vester Fernando. It was accordingly submitted that the subject evidence was hearsay upon hearsay, that is evidence of previous representations by Michael Jackson of previous representations made by Vester Fernando. Reliance was placed by counsel for the appellants on the decision of the High Court in  
     Lee v The Queen 
     .  
      
     89  
     We would accept that evidence of Vester Fernando saying  
     “I’ve got a machete here”  
     would have been hearsay. The Crown would be seeking to rely on this representation by Vester Fernando for the purpose of proving the truth of the fact Vester Fernando intended to assert, that is that he had a machete. However, in the circumstances, evidence of this previous representation by Vester Fernando was fairly insignificant, because in his statement Michael Jackson said that he had himself observed the blade of what looked like a machete and had seen it well enough to be able to describe the length, colour and curvature of the blade. 
      
     90  
     We would not accept that evidence of the other things said by Vester Fernando, if given by Michael Jackson in the witness box, would have been hearsay. Such evidence would not have been tendered for the purpose of proving the truth of any facts intended to be asserted by Vester Fernando. It would have been tendered simply for the purpose of proving that Vester Fernando had said those things. All that Michael Jackson intended to assert by these representations in his statement was that Vester Fernando had said these things. From the evidence of Vester Fernando saying these things shortly before the time when the offences charged were allegedly committed, the jury would be asked to draw inferences about Vester Fernando’s contemporaneous state of mind and in particular that he was willing to use the machete to kill someone.  
      
     91  
     The decision of the High Court in  
     Lee 
      can be clearly distinguished. In that case evidence that the witness Calin had made previous representations that the appellant Lee had said to Calin  
     “I’m running because I fired two shots… I did a job and the other guy was with me bailed out”, 
      was sought to be relied on by the Crown, not simply as evidence that the appellant had said these things to Calin, but as evidence that Lee had in fact fired two shots and had done a job and that his companion had bailed out, facts which the High Court said Calin had no way of knowing and did not intend to assert by his representations that Lee had said these things to him. 
      
     92  
     It was also submitted by counsel for the appellants that the subject evidence, as well as being  
     “evidence in relation to which Pt 3.2 (hearsay evidence)… applies”, 
      was also  
     “evidence in relation to which… Pt 3.4 (admissions) applies 
     ”. 
      
     93  
     The definition of “admission” in Pt 1 of the dictionary at the end of the Act is very broad. “Admission” means a previous representation made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding, which is adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding. The width of the definition of “admission” has been noted in a number of decisions of this Court. See for example  
     R v Horton  
     (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 2 November 1998 and  
     R v Esposito 
      (unreported Court of Criminal Appeal 20 November 1998). 
      
     94  
     In the present appeal senior counsel for the Crown accepted that “arguably” the subject evidence consisted of “admissions”. Certainly, the representation  
     “I’ve got a machete here” 
      was an admission. In our opinion, all of the subject evidence fell within the wide definition of “admission” in the Act and hence, on this ground also, the subject evidence came within para (a) of s 165(1). 
      
     95  
     It was also submitted by counsel for the appellants that the trial judge had erred in holding that the subject evidence did not fall within para (d) of s 165(1), as being  
     “evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving 
       
     rise to the proceeding 
     ”. 
      
     96  
     It was conceded by counsel for the appellants that in his statement to the police Michael Jackson had said that, although invited to join the two appellants in stealing a car, he had not wanted to join in the venture of stealing a car and had taken the opportunity, when Vester Fernando went to his sister’s house to get a jumper, to go to his cousin’s house, jump over the back fence and walk away. However, reliance was placed on Michael Jackson’s evidence that at the police station on 11 December 1994 he had been afraid of being charged by the police with having been a cockatoo for the appellants. 
      
     97  
     In further support of the submission that the subject evidence fell within para (d) of s 165(1), counsel for the appellants relied on evidence by the witness Lindsay Morgan that he had overheard some of the conversation between the appellants and Michael Jackson and that in that conversation Michael Jackson had said  
     “yes” 
      when asked  
     “to go and get a car” 
      and had walked with the two appellants towards the hospital. 
      
     98  
     Finally, counsel for the appellants sought to rely on what Michael Jackson had allegedly said to Muriel Dennis, Janette Dennis, and Tanya Murphy on the night of 10 December 1994, that on the night of 8 December he had walked to the hospital with the two appellants. However, in his evidence Michael Jackson denied having said what it was put to him he had said to these three persons. The decision by the Crown not to call these three persons as witnesses is the subject of another ground of appeal. However, so far as the present ground of appeal is concerned, there was simply no evidence of Michael Jackson saying to any of these persons what it was put to him in cross-examination he had said. 
      
     99  
     In our opinion, on the evidence given, the trial judge did not err in finding that, even if Michael Jackson had initially become a party to a joint venture to steal a car, he had withdrawn from that venture and that he was not  
     “a person who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding” 
      against the appellants. 
      
     100  
     We have held that the subject evidence was evidence in relation to which Pt 3.2 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      applied and also evidence in relation to which Pt 3.4 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      applied and hence the subject evidence was 
      “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable” 
      within s 165(1). Accordingly, if, as happened, there was a request by a party, the trial judge was bound to give a warning in accordance with sub-s(2) of s 165, unless there were  
     “good reasons 
       
     for not doing so”. 
      It has been held by this Court that  
     “in most 
       
     cases at least” 
      a trial judge who considers, pursuant to sub-s (3) of s 165, that there are good reasons for not giving a warning, should state what he considers those good reasons to be.  
     R v Beattie 
      (1996) 40 NSWLR 155 at 160. 
      
     101  
     In the present case, the trial judge held, as an alternative ground for refusing the application by counsel for Brendan Fernando, that there were good reasons for not giving a warning. However, his Honour did not in his judgment refusing the application say what those good reasons were. 
      
     102  
     It was submitted by counsel for the appellants that the trial judge had failed to state what his reasons were for not giving a warning, that there were not in fact good reasons for not giving a warning and that, on the contrary, there were good reasons for giving a warning, being the reasons given by counsel for Brendan Fernando in making the application at the trial. These reasons were, or at least included, that Michael Jackson’s statement made to the police had not been sworn to, that in his sworn evidence Michael Jackson had not verified his statement, that, on the contrary, in his sworn evidence Michael Jackson had given a different, inconsistent account and had said that what he had said to the police was not true and that what he had said to the police had been “made up”, that is consisted of lies, and gave a reason why he had lied to the police, namely that he had been afraid of being charged as some kind of accessory. It was further submitted that even if the subject evidence did not fall within para (d) of s 165(1), nevertheless, there was evidence that Michael Jackson was a person who had to some extent been involved with the two appellants shortly before the crimes charged were allegedly committed and at the time he made the statement had been afraid of being charged by the police with some offence because of that involvement and that this furnished an additional reason why a warning should have been given. 
      
     103  
     It was submitted on behalf of Vester Fernando, and we would accept, that it was unnecessary for Vester Fernando to have made a separate application of his own for a warning under s 165, after his co-accused had made an application which had been refused and that Vester Fernando, as well as Brendan Fernando, could seek to rely on the omission by the trial judge to give a warning. 
      
     104  
     Counsel for both appellants submitted, and we would accept, that if the trial judge did err in not giving a warning, it would not be possible to apply the proviso to s 6 of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     , having regard to the significance of Michael Jackson’s evidence and the importance attached to it at the trial by both the Crown and the trial judge. 
      
     105  
     It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that the trial judge had not erred in holding that there were good reasons for not giving a warning and that the trial judge had disclosed what those reasons were. 
      
     106  
     It is true that in the judgment given in refusing the application the trial judge did not state what the reasons were, which he considered to be good reasons. However, the decision of this Court in  
     Beattie 
      was not intended to lay down an inflexible rule that a trial judge should state the reasons which he considers to be good reasons in a judgment refusing the application for a warning. The policy underlying what was said in  
     Beattie 
      is that, if a judge refuses an application for a warning in reliance on sub-s(3) of s 165, the reasons on which the judge relies as being good reasons should be disclosed. In the present case, the reasons which the trial judge considered to be good reasons for not giving a warning can readily be ascertained from parts of the summing up and parts of the judgment his Honour gave on 4 June 1997, in which he refused applications that the evidence of what Michael Jackson had said in his statement be excluded or that the use to which that evidence could be put should be limited. In our opinion, it is legitimate to refer to this judgment for the purpose of discovering what were the reasons which his Honour considered to be good reasons within sub-s(3) of s 165, even though the judgment was a judgment given in determining applications of a different kind. 
      
     107  
     The reasons which his Honour considered to be good reasons, which appear at various parts of the summing up and in the judgment of 4 June 1997, were that the subject evidence was evidence of assertions made by Michael Jackson in a signed statement made to the police, only two days after the events in question, which had been made in the presence of his mother, that in his evidence Michael Jackson had admitted that he had made the assertions recorded in the statement to the police and, as to the reason he had put forward for allegedly lying to the police, Michael Jackson had in his evidence in the committal proceedings said that he had not been worried or concerned about going to the police station. 
      
     108  
     In our opinion, these reasons in combination were sufficient to amount to good reasons for not warning the jury that the subject evidence might be unreliable, notwithstanding Michael Jackson’s repudiation of the truth of the subject evidence in his sworn evidence. In the summing up the trial judge put the defence case concerning Michael Jackson’s evidence, including the submissions made by counsel, in a way which has not been the subject of criticism on the hearing of this appeal. 
      
     109  
     We would dismiss ground of appeal 7 in Brendan Fernando’s appeal. 
      
       
     Ground 8: 
       
     The trial judge erred in not directing the jury that the evidence of Michael Jackson upon which it relied had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
      
     110  
     The evidence of Michael Jackson referred to in this ground of appeal was, as with a number of the previous grounds of appeal, the evidence he gave in cross-examination by the Crown about what he had said in his statement to the police. 
      
     111  
     It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that this evidence was critical, because, if accepted, it would fix Brendan Fernando with knowledge of Vester Fernando's possession of the machete shortly before the offences were allegedly committed and with knowledge of the circumstances in which Vester Fernando might use the machete. It was submitted that  
     ""that material"" 
      formed  
     ""an indispensable intermediate step in a reasoning process towards an inference of guilt"" 
      and accordingly had to be established beyond reasonable doubt ( 
     Shepherd v The Queen 
      (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 585 per Dawson J). 
      
     112  
     We do not consider that this ground of appeal should be upheld. We note that no application for any such direction was made by counsel for the appellant at the trial. Dawson J's remarks in 
      Shepherd 
     , in the course of which he referred to  
     ""indispensable 
       
     intermediate steps"" 
      or  
     "" indispensable links"" 
      in a process of reasoning towards inferring guilt, were made in the context of a consideration of cases where the Crown relies, at least to a substantial extent, on circumstantial evidence. In the present case, there was much evidence of admissions by Brendan Fernando, including admissions that on the night of 8 and 9 December 1994 he had seen Vester Fernando get the machete and carry it up the sleeve of his clothing and that he had seen Vester Fernando smash the window of the car with the machete before any enterprise to abduct the victim was formed. There was also evidence by another witness, Lindsay Morgan, that on the night of 8 and 9 December 1994 he had seen Vester Fernando openly holding the machete, while Brendan Fernando was next to Vester Fernando. In these circumstances, we do not consider that acceptance of those parts of Michael Jackson's evidence, which, if accepted, would have shown that Brendan Fernando knew that Vester Fernando had a machete and might use it, was an  
     ""indispensable intermediate step 
     "" in a finding by the jury that Brendan Fernando was guilty. 
      
     113  
     We would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     Ground 9 
     : 
      A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by reason of the failure of the Crown to call as witnesses in its case Tanya Murphy, Muriel Dennis and Janette Dennis.  
      
     114  
     It would appear that in his opening address the Crown Prosecutor said that these three persons would be called as witnesses in the Crown case. However, during the Crown case the Crown Prosecutor decided not to call any of them and none of them were called. That they were not to be called was announced during the re-examination of Det Pollock. Counsel for Brendan Fernando complained about the Crown Prosecutor’s decision not to call the three women, saying that  
     “the defence wanted those three witnesses called”. 
      None of the three women were called in the defence case. The Crown Prosecutor explained his decision not to call the three women during a discussion between the trial judge and counsel in a break in the summing up. The Crown Prosecutor said:- 
      
       
     “The Crown… decided not to call those girls because the evidence of what Jackson said in his statement was admitted and those girls were only to be called if there was some difficulty in getting into evidence the statement that Jackson had made”. 
      
     115  
     In the summing up the trial judge gave a  
     Jones v Dunkell 
      direction against the Crown, because the Crown had not called these persons as witnesses. 
      
     116  
     We have already earlier in this judgment referred to the cross-examination of Michael Jackson by counsel for Brendan Fernando, in which counsel put to Michael Jackson what he had allegedly said to these women on the night of 10 December 1994. 
      
     117  
     It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that, if these persons had been called, they would have given evidence that Michael Jackson had said to them what had been put to Michael Jackson in cross-examination. It was submitted that such evidence by these persons could have been significant in the following ways:- 
      
     (i) What Michael Jackson had said to these women on the night of 10 December 1994 differed from what he had said in either his statement to the police or in his evidence and evidence that he had given yet a third version of events would have further weakened Michael Jackson’s credibility as a witness. 
      
       
        
         
         (ii) Such evidence would have confirmed Michael Jackson’s evidence that he was afraid of being charged by the police. 
          
         iii) Such evidence would have tended to show that Michael Jackson came within para (d) of s 165(1) of the  
         Evidence Act 
          and hence was a witness whose evidence should have been made the subject of a warning. 
         
        
       
      
     118  
     In our opinion, the non-calling of these three women did not lead to a miscarriage of justice. The version given by Michael Jackson in his statement to the police and the version allegedly given by him to these women varied only in respect of where Michael Jackson said he had left the two accused. In both of the versions he said the two accused had decided to steal a car. If these women had been called and had given evidence in accordance with what was put to Michael Jackson in cross-examination, such evidence would not have uniformly assisted the accused. Such evidence would have shown that one day after the events happened, Michael Jackson had said that the two accused had walked together with him as far as the hospital. However, any such evidence showing only that Michael Jackson had walked up to the gate of the hospital with the two accused would have stopped short of showing that Michael Jackson was  
     “a person who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding” 
      within para (d) of s165(1).  
      
     119  
     We reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     Ground 10: The trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to lead from Detective Pearson evidence relating to the co-appellant's shoes in the case against the appellant.  
      
     120  
     Det Pearson gave evidence that on 10 December 1994 he had observed a shoe impression near the oval and had formed the opinion that the impression was similar to shoe impressions he had observed both inside and outside the ward at the hospital. Det Pearson gave further evidence that on 11 December 1994 he had made a plaster cast of the shoe impression he had observed near the oval. This plaster cast was admitted into evidence. None of the evidence we have so far summarised was objected to. 
      
     121  
     Subsequently, the admissibility of further evidence proposed to be given by Det Pearson was argued. The proposed evidence was to the effect that Det Pearson had compared the plaster cast with shoes which Vester Fernando's sister had produced and which she said Vester Fernando had been wearing and that Det Pearson had formed the opinion that they were similar in length. The proposed evidence was objected to by both defence counsel. The trial judge decided to admit the evidence against both of the accused and not to limit the use to which the jury could put the evidence. 
      
     122  
     Det Pearson then gave evidence that he had not seen any matching shoe patterns but that  
     ""physically measuring"" 
      the plaster cast and the shoes produced by Vester Fernando's sister  
     ""I found that they bore similarity in their length"". 
      
     123  
     It was argued on the appeal that the evidence was not admissible even against Vester Fernando. However, although the evidence was of limited probative value, only amounting to an opinion by Det Pearson that the plaster cast and the shoes were merely  
     ""similar"" 
      and in one respect only, that of size, the evidence was admissible against Vester Fernando as being capable of tending to link him with the crime scene. The limitations of the evidence would have been readily apparent to the jury. 
      
     124  
     We are also of the opinion that the evidence was admissible against Brendan Fernando. The Crown case against Brendan Fernando was that Brendan Fernando had participated in a joint criminal venture with Vester Fernando. Evidence tending to show that Vester Fernando had been at the crime scene tended to prove part of the Crown case against Brendan Fernando and also tended to corroborate the accuracy of the admissions Brendan Fernando had made to the police. 
      
     125  
     This ground of appeal should be rejected. 
      
       
     Ground 11 
     :  
     The trial Judge erred in allowing the Crown to call a case in reply. 
      
     126  
     In order to deal with this ground of appeal it is necessary to refer to a number of matters which occurred at the trial. 
      
     127  
     At an early stage in the trial the voir dire hearing was held for the purpose of determining the admissibility of evidence of the admissions made by the appellant to the police. The trial judge's decision to admit this evidence was the subject of the appellant's first ground of appeal. 
      
     128  
     In the Crown case in chief in the voir dire hearing Constable Mayers, a police officer who had often had conversations with the appellant while he was stationed at Walgett, and Garry Trindall, an Aborignal Liason Officer at Walgett, gave evidence. 
      
     129  
     In the defence case in the voir dire hearing Professor Susan Hayes, a clinical psychologist and the head of the Department of Behavioural Science in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Sydney, gave evidence. During her oral evidence a report dated 2 May 1997 of a clinical psychological assessment by her of the appellant was admitted as an exhibit in the voir dire hearing. 
      
     130  
     In her report and in her oral evidence Professor Hayes said that she had seen Brendan Fernando on two occasions, on 26 March 1997 and 2 May 1997, that she had administered a number of psychological tests to him and the results of the tests showed that the appellant was mildly to moderately intellectually disabled and had brain damage. In her opinion, the level of intellectual disability demonstrated by the results of the tests meant that Brendan Fernando would have been  
     ""more vulnerable"" 
      to police questioning, more likely to yield to any pressure exerted by the police when interviewing him and  
     ""more susceptible"" 
      to any leading questions asked by the police. Professor Hayes also expressed the opinion that persons not familiar with psychometric testing would not be able to recognise the appellant's intellectual disability. The test results obtained by Professor Hayes and the opinions expressed by her were relevant to issues in the voir dire hearing. 
      
     131  
     In the voir dire hearing the Crown called in reply Dr Skinner, a consultant psychiatrist, who gave evidence inter alia that in her opinion a person having such a severe level of intellectual disability and indeed brain damage as Professor Hayes had found the appellant to have, would manifest neurological signs, which it would usually be possible for other persons  
     ""to pick up"". 
      
     132  
     As previously stated in this judgement, the trial judge held that he should admit the evidence of the admissions made by the appellant to the police. 
      
     133  
     It is now necessary to turn to some of the events which occurred in the trial itself, as distinct from the voir dire hearing. After the defence case of the co-accused had been closed, counsel for Brendan Fernando said that he would be calling Professor Hayes, who would be the only witness in Brendan Fernando's defence case, and that the Crown already had Professor Hayes’  
     ""most 
       
     recent report"", 
      that is the report of 2 May 1997. This was the first indication by counsel for the appellant at the trial that he would be calling Professor Hayes as a witness in the appellant's defence case. 
      
     134  
     In her evidence in the appellant's defence case Professor Hayes repeated evidence that she had earlier given in the voir dire hearing that she had seen the appellant, that she had administered psychological tests to him and that the results of the tests showed that he was mildly to moderately intellectually disabled. She then gave some evidence about whether persons with an intellectual disability of the level of the appellant's would manifest outward signs of that disability. Professor Hayes expressed the opinion that because of the appellant's intellectual disability he would be  
     ""slow on the uptake"" 
      and that the disability would affect his ability  
     ""to 
       
     work out what was going to happen"". 
      These opinions were relevant to whether the appellant had been mentally capable of entering into, and had in fact entered into, the criminal ventures with Vester Fernando alleged by the Crown. 
      
     135  
     After Professor Hayes had finished giving evidence, the appellant's defence case was closed. The Crown then, without any objection by counsel for Brendan Fernando at the trial, presented a Crown case in reply to Professor Hayes' evidence. 
      
     136  
     The first witness in the Crown case in reply was Dr Skinner. Dr Skinner had been in court while Professor Hayes gave her evidence. Dr Skinner gave evidence that in her opinion there was a discrepancy between the level of intellectual disability which Professor Hayes said she had found and the level of intellectual functioning Brendan Fernando had demonstrated during the taped interviews. In cross-examination Dr Skinner acknowledged that she, unlike Professor Hayes, had not had the advantage of seeing Brendan Fernando professionally. 
      
     137  
     After Dr Skinner's cross-examination had been concluded, the Crown Prosecutor applied to the trial judge for a direction that Brendan Fernando submit to an examination by Dr Skinner. The Crown Prosecutor said that he had not known that Professor Hayes would be called as a witness in the trial (as distinct from the voir dire hearing), until counsel for Brendan Fernando had so indicated, after the close of Vester Fernando's defence case. The trial judge queried his power to give any such direction and declined to give it. The trial Judge observed, and the Crown Prosecutor conceded, that the Crown would have known, notwithstanding the trial judge's decision in the voir dire hearing to admit the evidence of the appellant's admissions, that evidence might be called in the trial on behalf of Brendan Fernando with the object of throwing doubt on the reliability of the evidence of admissions. 
      
     138  
     The Crown then called as further witnesses in its case in reply Constable Mayers and Gary Trindall. It will be necessary in dealing with the next ground of appeal (ground 12) to refer to the evidence of these witnesses in some detail. For the purposes of the present ground of appeal, it is sufficient to note that each of the witnesses gave evidence of his dealings with Brendan Fernando and each as a lay person not having any special qualification in assessing intelligence, stated his opinion of Brendan Fernando's level of intelligence. 
      
     139  
     It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the Crown should not have been permitted to call a Crown case in reply. Reference was made to the statement of the principles governing the adducing of evidence in reply by the Crown in  
     Shaw v The Queen 
     , (1952) 85 CLR 365 which was approved in the majority judgement in 
      Killick v The Queen 
      (1981) 147 CLR, 565 at 568 - 9. In 
      Shaw v The Queen 
      Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Webb and Kitto JJ said at 379-80:- 
      
       
     ""Clearly the principle is that the Prosecution must present its case completely before the prisoner's answer is made. There are issues the proof of which do not lie upon the Prosecution and in such cases it may have a rebutting case, as when the defence is insanity. When the prisoner seeks to prove good character evidence may be allowed in reply. But the Prosecution may not split its case on any issue...it seems to us unsafe to adopt a rigid formula in view of the almost infinite variety of difficulties that may arise at a criminal trial. It is probably enough to say that the case must be very special or exceptional to warrant departure from the principle that the Prosecution must offer all its proofs during the progress of the Crown case and before the prisoner is called upon for his defence...further...the English cases make it plain enough that generally speaking an occasion will not suffice for allowing an exceptional course if it ought reasonably to have been foreseen. Again, it may be pointed out that even an unexpected occasion may be of such a nature that it would have been covered, had the Crown case been fully and strictly proved"". 
      
     140  
     It was submitted, in reliance on what was said in  
     Shaw 
     , that it was exceptional for the Crown to be permitted to call evidence in reply, that the Crown ought reasonably to have foreseen that the appellant's intellectual capacity would be a continuing issue in the trial and that the Crown had obtained the further advantages of Dr Skinner hearing Professor Hayes give her evidence before she gave her own and of the evidence given in the Crown case in reply being the last evidence that the jury heard. 
      
     141  
     As already stated, no objection was made at the trial to the Crown calling evidence in reply to Professor Hayes' evidence. 
      
     142  
     There was an important difference between the relevance of Professor Hayes' evidence in the voir dire hearing and the relevance of her evidence at the trial. In a voir dire hearing Professor Hayes' evidence related to the admissibility of the evidence of the admissions made by Brendan Fernando to the police. The question of the admissibility of this evidence was, of course, conclusively determined by the trial judge in the voir dire hearing. However, as the trial judge remarked when the Crown Prosecutor made his application after the conclusion of Dr Skinner's cross-examination in the Crown case in reply, it would have been open to the defence to call evidence at the trial with the object of throwing doubt on the reliability of the evidence of admissions which had been admitted. 
      
     143  
     No such evidence (that is evidence of the possible effect of Brendan Fernando's intellectual capacity upon the reliability of his answers when interviewed by the police) was led from Professor Hayes, when she gave evidence at the trial. That no such evidence was led would seem to have reflected a deliberate tactical decision made by counsel for Brendan Fernando at the trial, not to dispute the accuracy of the admissions made by Brendan Fernando to the police and to submit to the jury that the account which Brendan Fernando had given to the police was fully accurate. Although this account did contain many admissions by Brendan Fernando, it also included an assertion by him that before Ms Hoare was killed he had separated from Vester Fernando and had walked away, that is, that before Ms Hoare was killed Brendan Fernando had withdrawn from any joint criminal venture with Vester Fernando, so that he would not be criminally responsible for anything subsequently done by Vester Fernando. 
      
     144  
     The evidence given by Professor Hayes at the trial was directed to a quite different issue, which was stated by the trial judge in the summing up as being whether, because of his alleged intellectual disability, Brendan Fernando had been incapable of entering, and had not entered, into joint criminal ventures with Vester Fernando of the kinds alleged by the Crown. 
      
     145  
     In our opinion, the Crown could not reasonably have foreseen the ""occasion"" for calling the evidence which was called in reply, that evidence would be led in the defence case that Brendan Fernando's intellectual disability was such that he might not be capable of entering, and might not have entered, into the simple joint criminal enterprises alleged by the Crown of stealing a vehicle, abducting and sexually assaulting a woman and killing her. We are, accordingly, of the opinion that the trial judge did not err in allowing the Crown to call a case in reply to the evidence given by Professor Hayes, which was directed to a quite different issue from that which had arisen in the voir dire hearing. As we have already said, the calling by the Crown of a case in reply was not opposed by counsel for the appellant at the trial. It is true that the Crown gained certain incidental advantages but these did not, in our opinion, amount to a miscarriage of justice. 
      
     146  
     We would reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     Ground 12 
     :  
     The trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to call evidence from Constable Mayers and Gary Trindall as to their opinion of the appellant's intelligence. 
      
     147  
     We have already noted, in considering ground 11, that Constable Mayers and Gary Trindall gave evidence in the Crown case in reply. 
      
     148  
     Constable Mayers gave evidence that while he had been stationed at Walgett he had come to know Brendan Fernando, that he had spoken to Brendan Fernando regularly and that he had had no difficulty in conversing with Brendan Fernando. When asked for an assessment of Brendan Fernando's intelligence, Constable Mayers said,  
     ""I think Brendan Fernando's very intelligent and especially within the population of Walgett he would be right up there so far as being one of the most intelligent people there"". 
      
     149  
     Constable Mayers said in his evidence that in October 1994 he had spoken to Brendan Fernando about a particular matter, in the presence of Gary Trindall, and on that occasion Brendan Fernando had given some long answers to questions Constable Mayers asked. Constable Mayers had had no difficulty in understanding what Brendan Fernando had said and Brendan Fernando had not appeared to have any difficulty in understanding what Constable Mayers said. Brendan Fernando had denied that he was involved in the matter Constable Mayers was investigating and charges which had been brought against Brendan Fernando were subsequently dropped. In cross-examination Constable Mayers agreed that he had had no training in testing other persons' intelligence. 
      
     150  
     Mr Trindall gave evidence that he was an aboriginal community liaison officer in Walgett, that he knew 95 percent of the aboriginal population at Walgett, that he had first met Brendan Fernando 16 or 17 years previously, that he had had hundreds of conversations with Brendan Fernando and that he had had no difficulty in understanding Brendan Fernando or in being understood by Brendan Fernando. Mr Trindall considered that, with respect to intelligence,  
     ""he (Brendan Fernando) is average of anybody in Walgett"". 
      
     151  
     No objection was made at the trial by the appellant's counsel to any part of the evidence of Constable Mayers or Mr Trindall which I have summarised. 
      
     152  
     In his summing up, the trial judge said that a person's intelligence was not a matter solely for expert evidence. His Honour referred to the evidence of Constable Mayers and Mr Trindall. His Honour said that Mr Trindall had formed his views about Brendan Fernando's intelligence, on the basis of his own commonsense and experience. 
      
     153  
     It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the evidence by Constable Mayers and Mr Trindall about the appellant's intelligence was inadmissible under s 76 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      and was not rendered admissible by s 78 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     , that a lay person was not competent to express an opinion about someone else's intelligence and, alternatively, even if a lay person could express some kind of opinion about someone else's intelligence, a lay person would not be competent to express an opinion about that other person's comparative intelligence, that is that person's intelligence in comparison with other persons living in the same town. It was also submitted that the evidence of the investigation in October 1994 should not have been admitted, because it tended to suggest that Brendan Fernando might have committed some other offence. 
      
     154  
     We are of the opinion that the evidence given by Constable Mayers and Mr Trindall, which, as we have remarked, was not objected to, was admissible. It seems to us that a lay person, that is a person who does not have any special training in the assessing of intelligence and who has not administered any psychological tests to the subject person, may nevertheless, if he has had a large number of dealings with that person and if he states the basis for his opinion (as happened in the present case), express opinions in general, qualitative terms about the level of intelligence of that other person. We are also of the opinion that a lay person who has had dealings with many of the inhabitants of a small town can express an opinion about a person's comparative level of intelligence among the inhabitants of the town. Lay persons are permitted to express opinions on quite a large variety of matters, for example, identity of persons, speed, weather, handwriting and the age of a person. 
      
     155  
     Moreover, while Professor Hayes generally adopted the position in her evidence that lay persons would not notice the intellectual disability of the appellant which she said was disclosed by the psychological test results, nevertheless in part of her evidence she acknowledged that a casual acquaintance of a person such as Brendan Fernando might notice signs of his intellectual disability. Accordingly, evidence by  
     ""casual acquaintances"", 
      such as Constable Mayers and Mr Trindall, acquired some further significance by reason of Professor Hayes' evidence. 
      
     156  
     The evidence about the October 1994 incident did not cause the appellant any prejudice. It was clearly brought out in evidence that the appellant denied having been involved in any criminal activity and that the charges which had been brought against him had been dropped. 
      
     157  
     The remarks made by the trial judge in the summing up that a person's intelligence was not a matter solely for expert evidence and that Mr Trindall's opinion of the appellant's intelligence had been formed on the basis of his own commonsense and experience did not, in our opinion, reveal any error. 
      
     158  
     We would refuse leave under rule 4 to rely on this ground. 
      
      Ground 13: The trial judge erred in relation to the directions he gave to the jury concerning joint criminal enterprise and common purpose. 
      
     159  
     This ground of appeal is expressed in wide terms and the written submissions on behalf of the appellant were discursive. However, the ground of appeal became refined in the course of the appellant's counsel's oral submissions and the ground was ultimately described by counsel for the appellant more than once in his oral submissions as depending on ""a narrow point"". 
      
     160  
     In the summing up the trial judge gave the jury directions that each of the accused could be found guilty of each offence on the basis that he had been a party to a joint criminal enterprise. The directions given by the trial judge were generally in accordance with the model directions set out in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in this Court's decision in 
      R v Tangye 
      (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 and no complaint was levelled at these directions. 
      
     161  
     The directions given by the trial judge in the summing up which were challenged were the directions relating to common purpose and in particular the following direction:- 
      
       
     ""If, however, you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the accused, Vester Fernando, who inflicted the wound upon the deceased with the intention of killing her, but you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, Brendan Fernando, was present intentionally assisting...him to kill the deceased but that you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he and the other accused had agreed to steal the car, abduct the girl or sexually assault her, and you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it was in the accused's, Brendan Fernando's, contemplation, that in carrying out such crimes or any of them the accused Vester Fernando might kill the deceased, then the accused Brendan Fernando may be found guilty upon that basis"". 
      
     162  
     The Crown Prosecutor's opening address was not recorded and what the Crown Prosecutor said about the basis upon which the accused might be found liable has to be inferred from a note which the trial judge said he had made of part of the opening address. This note was to the effect that the Crown case against both accused was that 
     , ""The two accused (were) there to kill her"", 
      that is that the two accused both being present acted in concert to kill the victim. 
      
     163  
     The alternative basis on which Brendan Fernando might be liable under the doctrine of common purpose was first put forward by the Crown Prosecutor in discussion between the Bench and counsel after all the evidence in the trial had been given. Counsel for the appellant at the trial opposed the adding of the additional basis on which the appellant could be found liable but acknowledged  
     ""to be frank it didn't come as any great surprise"". 
      
     164  
     On the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellant did not submit that the alternative basis of liability under the doctrine of common purpose should not have been put to the jury. The submission which was pressed was that under the directions given by His Honour the jury could have found Brendan Fernando guilty of the murder of Ms Hoare, on the basis that in carrying out any of the foundational crimes mentioned, that is stealing the car, abducting the victim or sexually assaulting the victim, Brendan Fernando contemplated that Vester Fernando might kill the victim, whereas it was not open to the jury to find that Brendan Fernando contemplated that in carrying out the crime of stealing the car Vester Fernando might kill the victim. There was no link between the stealing of the car, with which Ms Hoare had no connection at all, and the killing of Ms Hoare. It was accepted by counsel for the appellant that the other offences of abducting Ms Hoare or sexually assaulting Ms Hoare were properly included in the directions. 
      
     165  
     The inclusion of the offence of stealing the car in the directions given by the trial judge about common purpose may have occurred, because when the Crown Prosecutor first put forward the alternative basis of liability he identified the foundational crime as having been the joint enterprise to steal a car. 
      
     166  
     We would mention in passing that the attitude adopted by the Crown Prosecutor, after the Crown case had been closed and he was pressed to state how the Crown put its case against the accused, that  
     ""in addressing (that is in final address) I would say what the Crown case was"" 
      and  
     ""I would like to hear what the accused have to say"" 
      is not correct and was not warranted by anything said by this Court in 
      Tangye 
     . 
      
     167  
     In its written submissions the Crown sought to defend in their entirety the directions given by the trial judge about common purpose. However, in oral submissions the Crown conceded that the offence of stealing the car should not have been included in the directions as a possible foundational offence. It was submitted that this was an appropriate case for the application of rule 4 or of the proviso to s 6 of the  
     Criminal Appeal Act 
     . 
      
     168  
     We consider that this is an appropriate case for the application of r 4. No complaint was made about the directions at the trial. It would have been quite obvious to the jury that they could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Brendan Fernando contemplated that in carrying out the crime of stealing the car Vester Fernando might kill Ms Hoare. The jury were properly directed that they could find Brendan Fernando guilty of the murder of Ms Hoare, on the basis that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Brendan Fernando contemplated that in the carrying out of the crimes of abducting or sexually assaulting Ms Hoare Vester Fernando might kill Ms Hoare. 
      
     169  
     We consider that leave to argue this ground of appeal should be refused under r 4. 
      
       
     Ground 14: The trial judge erred in the directions which he gave the jury pursuant to section 20 of the Evidence Act concerning the appellant's decision not to give evidence. 
      
     170  
     In order properly to consider this ground of appeal it is necessary to refer to a number of things which happened at the trial. 
      
     171  
     At the trial the co-accused Vester Fernando gave evidence but the appellant Brendan Fernando did not. After the Crown case in reply had been closed and the taking of evidence had accordingly been completed, there was discussion between the trial judge and counsel about various matters. In the course of this discussion the Crown Prosecutor referred to the decision of this Court in 
      R v O.G.D  
     (unreported 3 June 1997) in which s 20 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      had been considered. The trial judge said that he was wondering whether he should make any comment on the failure of the appellant to give evidence, there being "" 
     enough problems in the case already"". 
      Counsel for Vester Fernando pointed out, correctly, that he was  
     ""not prevented from commenting"". 
      The trial judge then stated that, if counsel for Vester Fernando made some comment on the failure of the appellant to give evidence, that could affect what course the trial judge adopted. 
      
     172  
     The final addresses of counsel were not recorded. However, it can be inferred from remarks made by the trial judge to counsel and from part of the trial judge's summing up that counsel for Vester Fernando told the jury that Vester Fernando had given evidence, that his decision to give evidence was a choice by him which he did not have to make and that he had thereby exposed himself to cross-examination and  
     ""critical assessment"". 
      Counsel for Vester Fernando explicitly compared his client with Brendan Fernando, who he said had chosen to exercise his right to silence. 
      
     173  
     After counsel had addressed, the trial judge informed counsel that he proposed to comment on Brendan Fernando's failing to give evidence and outlined the nature of the comments he proposed to make. This outline was substantially in accordance with the comment the trial judge later made in the summing up. After the trial judge had given this outline, counsel for the appellant submitted that the proposed comment was inappropriate, insofar as the jury would be told that they could more readily draw inferences adverse to Brendan Fernando in the absence of evidence from him, because in the present case Brendan Fernando had not remained silent. True it was that he had not given evidence at the trial but in his interviews by the police he had given a full account of what he said had happened and this account had been put before the jury. The trial judge decided to give the directions which he had outlined to counsel. The directions his Honour gave included the following:- 
      
       
     “However, a failure to contradict or explain incriminating evidence, in circumstances where it would be reasonable to expect it to be in the power of an accused to do so, may make it easier for you to accept or draw inferences from evidence relied upon by the Crown. Inferences available to be drawn from facts proved by the Crown’s case can be drawn more safely or more readily where the accused elects not to give evidence on relevant facts which you, the jury, perceive to be within his knowledge. Where the evidence of the Crown witnesses is left undenied or uncontradicted by, for example, an accused’s evidence, in circumstances where the accused must have personal knowledge of the relevant facts, doubts about the reliability of the Crown witnesses may be more readily discounted and the evidence of those witnesses more readily accepted. However, members of the jury, I should give you a further warning and direction, that there may be reasons unknown to you why the accused person, Brendan Fernando, even if otherwise in a position to contradict or explain evidence, remained silent”. 
      
     174  
     It was submitted by counsel for Brendan Fernando that under the terms of s 20 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      a trial judge is permitted, but is not required, to comment on the failure of an accused person to give evidence. This submission is clearly correct. The relevant part of s 20 is sub-s(2), which provides as follows: 
      
       
     “The judge or any party (other than the prosecutor) may comment on a failure of the defendant to give evidence. However, unless the comment is made by another defendant in the proceeding, the comment must not suggest that the defendant failed to give evidence because the defendant was, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence concerned”. 
      
     175  
     However, notwithstanding that s 20 is expressed in permissive and not obligatory language, counsel for the appellant conceded that if counsel for the co-accused had made so much in his closing address as he apparently did of his own client's decision to give evidence and the failure of Brendan Fernando to give evidence, then the trial judge may well have been forced into a position where he was obliged to make some comment. 
      
     176  
     It was, however, submitted that, even if it was appropriate in the circumstances for the trial judge to make some comment, the trial judge should not have included in his comment a part which was described as the “Weissensteiner element” ( 
     Weissensteiner v The Queen  
     (1993) 178 CLR 217 and which was identified as consisting of the first three sentences in the part of the comment which has already been quoted. 
      
     177  
     It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that these sentences should not have been included in the comment, for the same reason as had been advanced by counsel at the trial, that Brendan Fernando had waived his right to remain silent when he was interviewed by the police, he had given his version to the police, he had participated fully in the process of being interrogated by the police, the version he had given was not, or was not generally, an exculpatory version and the version he had given had been put before the jury.  
      
     178  
     As was pointed out by counsel for the Crown on the appeal,  
     Weissensteiner 
      itself was not a case in which the accused had remained silent during the investigation of the alleged offences. As appears from the report of the High Court decision (at p 221 and pp 222-3), Weissensteiner had spoken to police and customs officers and had participated in a series of tape recorded interviews. It is, however, true that the accounts that Weissensteiner gave during the investigation were exculpatory and, on the Crown case, false. 
      
     179  
     In the present case, notwithstanding the amount of detail in the version of events Brendan Fernando had given the police, the drawing of inferences remained important. It is apparent that counsel for Brendan Fernando in his final address invited the jury to draw inferences from other evidence, so as to check the accuracy of the admissions made by Brendan Fernando. Moreover, although the version given by Brendan Fernando to the police contained many damaging admissions, it was exculpatory in an important respect, in that according to Brendan Fernando’s version he had left Vester Fernando and the victim and had walked away, before the victim was killed. The jury had to determine whether, contrary to Brendan Fernando’s out of court version, they could draw an inference beyond reasonable doubt that Brendan Fernando had not withdrawn from a joint criminal venture with Vester Fernando before the victim was killed. In our opinion, because of the importance of the drawing of inferences at the trial, it was appropriate for the trial judge to include in his comment on the failure of Brendan Fernando to give evidence what has been described as “the  
     Weissensteiner 
      element”. 
      
     180  
     It was further submitted by counsel for the appellant, in reliance on parts of the then Chief Justice’s judgment in  
     R v O.G.D  
      that the trial judge should have discussed with counsel the reasons for Brendan Fernando’s failure to give evidence and should have explored with counsel whether the two charges Brendan Fernando was facing should be distinguished and whether a reason for Brendan Fernando not giving evidence might be that, while he might have an answer to one of the charges, he had no answer to the other charge and going into the witness box would involve him in making admissions on the charge to which he had no answer. It was contended that Brendan Fernando might have had an answer to the murder charge but would not seem to have had any answer to the sexual assault charge. 
      
     181  
     We do not consider that this submission should be accepted. As appears from a part of the summing up which was not the subject of any complaint, the trial was conducted on the basis that the admissions made by Brendan Fernando proved the sexual assault charge against him beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour said, with respect to the police interviews of Brendan Fernando:- 
      
       
     “I do not understand Mr Parker on behalf of Brendan Fernando to dispute what is said in these documents and, indeed, members of the jury, I do not understand Mr Parker to be suggesting in respect of the second count, the one of aggravated sexual assault, that the admissions of Brendan Fernando do not constitute admissions proving that offence beyond reasonable doubt”. 
      
     182  
     In these circumstances, it would not have been a reason for Brendan Fernando not giving evidence, that he was afraid that, if he gave evidence, he might have to make admissions which would inculpate him in the sexual assault charge. 
      
     183  
     It was further submitted by counsel for the appellant that a further likely reason for Brendan Fernando not giving evidence was that, if he gave evidence, he would cease being “a silent witness” against Vester Fernando (in the sense that what he had said in his out of court version was incriminatory of Vester Fernando and was before the jury but was not admissible in the trial of Vester Fernando) and would become “an actual witness” against Vester Fernando, in that what he said in evidence in the witness box would be admissible in the trial of Vester Fernando. If Brendan Fernando had given evidence, the Crown Prosecutor would have been able to cross-examine Brendan Fernando for the purpose of proving the Crown case against Vester Fernando. Brendan Fernando would have been obliged to give answers incriminating Vester Fernando and would have been regarded as “a dog”, with unpleasant consequences for himself.  
      
     184  
     We note, however, that Brendan Fernando had in the interviews with the police already made extensive allegations against Vester Fernando. If the making of allegations of criminality against Vester Fernando carried the risk of Brendan Fernando being labelled “a dog”, then it is likely that this had already happened, even if what Brendan Fernando had said out of court was not legally admissible against Vester Fernando. Furthermore, there is no indication that at the trial counsel appearing for Brendan Fernando suggested to the trial judge or to the jury that the fear of being labelled “a dog” by Vester Fernando was a reason for Brendan Fernando not giving evidence. We would reject the submission presently being considered. 
      
     185  
     It was further put by counsel for the appellant that the trial judge had decided to make a comment under s 20, because of what counsel for the co-accused had told the jury in his closing address. It was submitted that, if Brendan Fernando had been tried alone, it was unlikely that the trial judge would have made any comment. Hence, Brendan Fernando had suffered prejudice through being tried jointly with Vester Fernando. However, counsel did not really press a submission that the trial of Brendan Fernando had miscarried for this reason alone. Counsel did say that it was a matter relied on by the appellant in support of Ground 16 in his appeal. 
      
     186  
     We would reject this submission. For the reasons we have already given, it is likely that the drawing of inferences would have been important at any trial of the appellant, whether he was tried separately or jointly with Vester Fernando, and it would have been appropriate for a trial judge to make a comment pursuant to s 20, including in that comment the  
     Weissensteiner 
      element.  
      
     187  
     We reject this ground of appeal. 
      
       
     Ground 15: The trial judge erred in making an impermissible comment to the jury to the effect that they may feel “that what the Crown has had to put is telling as and against Brendan Fernando but that is a matter for you”. 
      
     188  
     The context in which this remark was made by the trial judge in his summing up was as follows. His Honour was reviewing the submissions which had been made by counsel for the appellant and the Crown Prosecutor. His Honour referred to a submission made by counsel for the appellant that by the time Ms Hoare was killed the appellant had walked away from her and Vester Fernando. His Honour then referred to a submission made by the Crown Prosecutor that, apart from other evidence, immediately south of where the body of the victim was found there were two parallel, side by side tracks, as if two persons had walked away from the body together. The Crown submitted that the jury should find that these tracks had been made by the two accused. The trial judge then made the comment complained of. 
      
     189  
     It was accepted by counsel for the appellant that a trial judge may within limits make comments on the facts. However, it was submitted that this had been a comment by the trial judge on an important matter and, indeed, it was submitted, the ultimate issue the jury had to decide on the charge of murder against Brendan Fernando. It was contended that the comment was not really a comment on the evidence but a comment about the strength of one party (the Crown’s) submissions. The likely effect of this comment made by the trial judge would have been aggravated by other comments made by the trial judge in the summing up in which he conveyed to the jury his personal views about some other parts of the evidence, for example whether Michael Jackson’s evidence in his evidence in chief or his version in his statement given to the police should be preferred and whether evidence by lay witnesses of their opinions of Brendan Fernando’s intellectual capacity was to be preferred to the evidence of the highly qualified Professor Hayes who had conducted recognised psychometric tests on Brendan Fernando. It was pointed out that no such endorsement had been given by the trial judge to any of the submissions made on behalf of Brendan Fernando. 
      
     190  
     We do not consider that this ground of appeal should be upheld. As was accepted by counsel for the appellant, a trial judge is not prohibited from commenting on the facts and may within limits comment on the facts. In  
     B v The Queen 
      (1992) 175 CLR 599 Brennan J in a passage which was referred to by this Court in  
     R v Nguyen 
      (unreported 20 May 1996) said:- 
      
       
     “A trial judge has a broad discretion in commenting on the facts and in choosing the strength of the language employed in commenting on the facts but the comment must stop short of overawing the jury. It must exhibit a judicial balance so that the jury is not deprived ‘of an adequate opportunity of understanding and giving effect to the defence and the matters relied upon in support of the defence’”. 
      
     191  
     Applying these principles, we do not consider that what his Honour said went beyond the bounds of permissible comment by a trial judge. There is no distinction in our view, between comment on primary facts and comment on any inference which one party seeks to have drawn. Early in the summing up the trial judge gave the usual direction that the determination of the facts was for the jury alone and if any views which the trial judge expressed on the facts did not coincide with their own, the judge’s views were to be put to one side. In the very comment which is challenged the judge added 
       
     “that that is a matter for you”. In our opinion, the comment made by the trial judge fell short of overawing the jury. In the summing up the trial judge adequately put the defence and the matters relied upon in support of the defence. 
      
       
     Ground 16: Even if the Court was not persuaded to intervene in respect of any of the grounds referred to above, it is submitted that the conviction should nevertheless be quashed on the basis that it is unsafe and unsatisfactory in the sense referred to by this Court in R v Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396 by reason of the accumulation of matters catalogued in the earlier grounds.  
      
     192  
     The use of the expression “unsafe and unsatisfactory” has been deprecated in very recent decisions of the High Court. However, the intent of this ground is clear. It is contended that there was a miscarriage of justice at the trial of Brendan Fernando by reason of the combination of the matters complained of in the earlier grounds of appeal. We have rejected all the earlier grounds of appeal considered individually and having regard to what we have said in dealing with those earlier grounds, we do not consider that the present ground has been made out.  
      
     193  
     In our opinion Brendan Fernando’s appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
     APPEAL OF VESTER ALLAN FERNANDO 
      
      Grounds 1 & 2: The trial miscarried and the verdict of the jury was unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
      
     194  
     We shall deal with these grounds at the conclusion of our reasons dealing with Vester Fernando’s appeal. 
      
       
     Grounds 3 & 4: There ought to have been separate trials. 
      
     195  
     As we have noted above one of the grounds of appeal most strenuously urged on behalf of the appellant Vester Fernando, is that both his Honour Temby AJ and Abadee J should have acceded to applications that Vester Fernando be tried separately. The application before Temby AJ had been made on 23 April 1997 that is approximately a fortnight before the commencement of the subject trial. During the course of the trial this application was unsuccessfully renewed to Abadee J a number of times. The basis of each application was identical. 
      
     196  
     The nub of the submission made in this regard related to the admissions made by Brendan Fernando in the interview originally recorded in Det Pearson’s notebook, the contents of which were put to Brendan Fernando during the course of the electronically recorded interview and the electronic recording made of Brendan Fernando’s statements and actions during what is colloquially known as a “runaround”. The submission was that what was recorded so directly implicated Vester Fernando as to be unfairly prejudicial to him as to prevent him having a fair trial. 
      
     197  
     On behalf of the appellant, Brendan Fernando, while this ground was not specifically raised in his grounds of appeal as filed, Mr Buddin SC as part of the omnibus ground raised that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory also contended that a separate trial should have been ordered in relation to his client. In support of this contention Mr Buddin submitted that because of the attitude taken by fellow prisoners to those who inform on co-offenders that Brendan Fernando was inhibited from giving evidence in the trial because that evidence would have implicated Vester Fernando. 
      
     198  
     We turn then to the applicable law relating to this aspect of the appeal. 
      
     199  
     A convenient staring point is the decision in  
     R v Assim  
     (1966) 2 QB 249. There, Sachs LJ delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal said: 
      
       
     “As a general rule, it is of course, no more proper to have tried by the same jury several offenders on charges of committing individual offences that have nothing to do with each other than it is to try before the same jury offences committed by the same person that have nothing to do with each other. Where, however, the matters which constitute the individual offences of the several offenders are, upon the available evidence, so related whether in time or other factors, that the interests of justice are best served by their being tried together, then they can properly be the subject of counts in one indictment and can, subject always to the discretion of the court, be tried together. Such a rule, of course, includes cases where there is evidence that several offenders acted in concert but is not limited to such cases.” 
      
     200  
     This passage in the judgment of Sachs LJ was quoted with approval by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
     R v Annakin & Ors 
     , 23 November 1988 where the court observed at p 13: 
      
       
     “In the ultimate each case must be dealt with according to the evidence and by reference to the considerations relevant to whether prejudice would be caused so as to prevent the accused being given a fair trial.” 
      
     201  
     The court there pointed out that in  
     De Jesus v The Queen 
      (1986) 68 ALR 1 the High Court had reaffirmed the need for the trial judge to examine the matter from the point of view of the prejudice to be caused to the accused, whether he or she would have a fair trial or not. 
      
     202  
     In  
     R v Grondkowski 
      (1946) 1 KB 369 the Court of Criminal Appeal at 373 cited with approval the following paragraph from  
     R v Gibbons & Proctor 
      (1918) 13 Cr App R p 134: 
      
       
     “It is not enough to say that counsel could have defended them more easily if they had been tried separately … there may have been many things made clear to the jury which would not have been made clear if the prosecution had been embarrassed by having to deal with the two cases separately. The whole story was before the jury of what went on in the house where the two appellants lived together.” 
      
     203  
     Grondkowski 
      was a case involving cut-throat defences. As we apprehend the passage cited and other passages from the judgment it was considered that cases of that kind are better heard together. The reason for that is the opportunity given to the jury to observe each of the accused and to consider the whole of the relevant facts rather than what may be a misleading portion of them. In  
     Grondkowski 
      it was also said: 
      
       
     “Prima facie it appears to the court that where the essence of the case is that the prisoners were engaged on a common enterprise that it is obviously right and proper that they should be jointly indicted and jointly tried and in some cases it would be as much in the interests of the accused as of the prosecution that they should be.” 
      
     204  
     Grondkowski 
      has been consistently followed by courts in this State including  
     R v Kerekes 
      (1973) WN;  
     R v Flaherty & Ors 
      (1968) 3 NSWLR and  
     R v Merrett 
      19 A Crim R 363. As was pointed out in the joint judgment of Slattery CJ at CL and Carruthers J in the last mentioned case citing from  
     Grondkowski 
     , it is necessary for the judge to consider the interests of justice as well as the interests of the prisoners. The interests of justice do not mean only the interests of prisoners. There is an additional interest in conserving costs and avoiding inconvenience to witnesses properly to be taken into account: see  
     R v Oliver 
      57 ALR 543 at 547. Further, there is the undesirable risk the separate trials will lead to verdicts which are inconsistent on the facts.  
     R v Lake 
      64 Cr App R 172. 
      
     205  
     To these references we would add the observations of Herron J (as he then was) in  
     R v Beavan 
      69 WN 141. In that case his Honour pointed out (at pp142-143)  
     “it is in accordance with the ordinary rule that where two are engaged on a common enterprise, it is proper that they should be 
       
     tried together.” 
      His Honour next pointed to the common situation in an alleged joint crime involving common parties that one or more of those charged will endeavour to exculpate himself or herself at the expense of the co-accused, a situation he described as a matter of  
     “human experience presenting as it does a human problem for a jury to deal with as a matter of commonsense.” 
      His Honour concluded: 
      
       
     “If separate trials were had, very often only one half of the picture could be presented to the jury. In order to do complete justice, juries are entitled to see and hear all those who are alleged to have acted in common purpose, and it is neither a rule of law nor of practice that where an essential part of one accused’s defence amounts to an attack on a co-accused there must be separate trials. Cases have occurred and will no doubt continue to occur, in which one accused says that he or she was persuaded by the superior intellect of the other accused to take some part in the enterprise, or that he or she was intimidated by the relationship or threats of that other. It is essential to the proper appreciation of such cases that the jury should see and hear all parties. It is true that statements not on oath can be prejudicial to the one referred to in them, but as they are not statements on oath the jury can be warned by the trial judge to reject those references to the co-accused, and there is no reason to think that a commonsense jury will refuse to follow such advice.” 
      
     206  
     It should be noted that the remarks of Herron J, of course, refer to the evidentiary situation which was then pertaining whereby accused persons were entitled to make unsworn statements from the dock, an evidentiary feature which is no longer part of criminal procedure in New South Wales. 
      
     207  
     In  
     R v Dellapatrona & Duffield 
      (1993) 31 NSWLR 123 this Court said at 133C: 
      
       
     “There remains a balance to be struck between the public interest in the efficient despatch of criminal trials and any prejudice which may be caused to the accused. It is desirable to have all those charged in relation to a particular crime tried at the same time unless positive injustice would thereby be caused… .” 
      
     208  
     The court further said in  
     Dellapatrona and Duffield 
      at 134C: 
      
       
     “It should, however, be emphasised that separate trials will not be granted merely because there is evidence admissible against one accused but inadmissible against another accused to whom it is prejudicial. The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada proceeded upon the clear basis that separate trials should only be granted in such a case where the evidence admissible against the second accused (to whom the prejudice is caused) is substantially weaker than that admissible against the first.” 
      
     209  
     Dealing with a ground asserting an error in the trial judge’s discretion to refuse an application for separate trials, the court stated at 137A: 
      
       
     “Although such an exercise of discretion may be reviewed on appeal (within well-known limits), this Court does have the benefit of the hindsight gained by knowing what has in fact transpired at the trial, and it is also able to judge - by reference to the whole of the evidence and to the verdict - whether the risk of impermissible prejudice by reason of the joint trial was worse than that contemplated at the time and whether it had in fact amounted to positive injustice to the appellant. In that sense, the task of this Court is not the usual one of reviewing the exercise of a trial judge’s discretion ..” 
      
     210  
     In  
     R v Baartman 
     , unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 6 October 1994, this Court approved the summary of principles involved in matters such as this by Hunt J in  
     R v Midis 
     , unreported, NSWSC 27 March 1991. There, his Honour had made the following statement of principle: 
      
       
     “Briefly, the relevant principles are that: 
      
       
        1. Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and 
        
        2. Where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and 
        
        3. Where there is real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material, a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.” 
       
      
     211  
     Finally, reference should be made to what fell from the High Court in  
     Webb and Hay v The Queen 
      [1993-94] 181 CLR 41 where Toohey J at 88-89 (with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed) dealt with the relevant principle as follows: 
      
       
     “King CJ dealt with this ground by pointing out that there are ‘strong reasons of principle and policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought to be tried together. That is particularly so where each seeks to cast the blame on the other’. What King CJ referred to as ‘strong reasons of principle and policy’ were discussed by his Honour in Regina v Collie (1991) 56 SASR 302 at 307-311. I respectfully agree with that discussion which emphasises that when accused are charged with committing a crime jointly, prime facie there should be a joint trial. There are administrative factors pointing in that direction but, more importantly, consideration by the same jury at the same trial is likely to avoid inconsistent verdicts, particularly when each accused tries to cast the blame on the other or others. There are of course dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the admission of evidence which would not be admitted at the trial of one accused. That risk must be obviated by express and careful directions to the jury as to the use they may make of the evidence so far as it concerns each accused.” 
      
     212  
     Accordingly, in determining whether a separate trial should be granted the court must carry out a balancing process between the community interest described by Herron J in  
     Beavan 
      and Toohey J in  
     Webb and Hay 
      and the question of undue prejudice to an accused as described in the authorities to which we have referred. 
      
     213  
     It should be noted that throughout the trial Abadee J was at pains to instruct the jury as to the restrictions as to the use the jury could make of evidence called against one accused. The transcript of evidence is studded with such directions. An example of the care taken by his Honour in this regard made be found when photographs of Brendan Fernando’s hands taken at the Walgett police station were tendered in evidence. There his Honour said: 
      
       
     “Members of the jury, once again this is evidence only in the case as and against Brendan. This material touches upon the Crown case brought against Brendan but not against Vester, so please consider it in that way and that way only.” 
      
     214  
     Furthermore, in the course of the summing up his Honour again took care to similarly direct the jury when dealing with the Crown case against Brendan Fernando. 
      
     215  
     This Court is of the view that his Honour in so doing fully complied with the strictures adverted by the authorities to which we have referred. 
      
     216  
     However, the question remains as to whether or not even despite his Honour’s careful directions the risk remained that Vester Fernando was so unduly prejudiced by the reception of evidence against Brendan Fernando that he was denied a fair trial. 
      
     217  
     It was submitted on Vester Fernando’s behalf that the effect of the jury viewing the video recording of Brendan Fernando’s words and actions implicating Vester Fernando was such as to make it impossible for any direction to obviate the risk of undue prejudice. 
      
     218  
     In particular it was submitted what was recorded as occurring during the “runaround” was of such a nature as to make it impossible for the impression given of Vester Fernando’s part in the events so described to be removed in the jury’s mind by any direction. 
      
     219  
     It should be noted that the court has viewed the subject video recordings. 
      
     220  
     The tenor of Brendan Fernando’s statements to the police was that while he was present during most of the events which occurred he was subject to the control of Vester Fernando who was armed with a machete. Indeed, he stated to the police at the time when the victim was killed he was not present, having left the company of Vester Fernando and the victim shortly before the lethal event must have occurred. Thus while his statements may not be considered as being a complete “cut throat” defence they are certainly exculpatory to a degree of his own participation and thoroughly implicate Vester Fernando.  
      
     221  
     He, of course, did not give evidence in the trial thus his statements were not capable of being tested by either the Crown Prosecutor or Vester Fernando’s counsel. 
      
     222  
     However, his recorded admissions do, in the court’s view, fall within the type of evidence adverted to in the authorities and particularly by Toohey J in  
     Webb and Hay 
      which support the contention that there ought to have been a joint trial. 
      
     223  
     Accordingly, we are of the view that neither Temby AJ nor Abadee J fell into error in rejecting the applications made before them. However, a question remains as to whether or not the manner in which these admissions were presented to the jury did in fact create a situation whereby Vester Fernando was unfairly prejudiced thus preventing him receiving a fair trial. 
      
     224  
     It is the court’s opinion that his Honour’s directions, both during the course of the trial and in his summing up, as to the use the jury could make of the evidence tendered against Brendan Fernando, including the video tape material, were such as to obviate any risk of undue prejudice. 
      
     225  
     Juries must be taken to have obeyed clear directions given by trial judges as to the manner in which they should deal with evidence adduced in trials. 
      
     226  
     In these circumstances we are of the view that his Honour’s directions were such as to obviate the risk of undue prejudice and accordingly we dismiss these grounds of appeal. 
      
       
     Ground 5 
      
     227  
     There are a number of sub-paragraphs of this ground, all of which complain of error by the trial judge in his conduct of the trial. We deal with these in turn: 
      
       
       (a) 
         
       Allowing the Crown Prosecutor to read the statement of the witness Bruce Lee Scott in re-examination 
       
      
     228  
     This witness was one of those staying at Orana Haven who claimed to have seen the appellant in possession of a machete whilst residing there. In short, the witness said that he saw the appellant showing another resident at Orana Haven a black-handled machete. The witness described the machete he then saw as looking like a machete introduced into evidence before the jury. He said that he told a policeman about the machete and the policeman prepared a statement which he read to the witness who could not read. Mr Scott said he signed the statement after it had been read to him. 
      
     229  
     In cross-examination at the trial, having been reminded of his evidence that the statement he gave to the police had been read to him, he was then asked this question and gave this answer: 
      
       
     “Q. But you had no way of knowing what was read out to you was accurate or not because you yourself can’t read? 
      
       
        A. Yes” 
       
      
     230  
     The Crown Prosecutor was granted leave in re-examination to take the witness through the statement given to the police to ascertain whether what he had told the police officer was contained in the document, which he agreed he had signed as being true and correct. 
      
     231  
     The questions asked in cross-examination suggested the possibility that what the police officer read to the witness before he signed the statement was not in the statement at all. In our opinion the Crown is correct in submitting that this cross-examination made it appropriate for the Crown Prosecutor to re-examine in the manner in which he did. 
      
     232  
     This ground fails. 
      
       
       (b) Failing to sufficiently distinguish for the jury the evidence admissible against the appellant from that admissible against his co-accused 
       
      
     233  
     In considering Grounds 3 and 4 for this appellant we have already remarked upon the care with which and the number of occasions upon which the trial judge instructed the jury both during the trial and when summing up in relation to the restrictions upon the use the jury could make of evidence called against one accused when considering the case against the other accused. 
      
     234  
     The appellant complains in particular that the trial judge failed to adequately instruct the jury as to the use it could make of the evidence adduced against Brendan Fernando on the “runaround”. 
      
     235  
     When the runaround evidence was introduced through Det. Sgt. Pearson, and after part of the video tape had been played, the transcript records the following request by counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial (T 745): 
      
       
     “WENDLER: Would your Honour remind the jury that what they have just seen is not evidence in the case concerning Vester Fernando.” 
      
     236  
     This request prompted his Honour to give this direction: 
      
       
     “Members of the jury, you may or may not recall on day one, it seems to be so long ago, but I did indicate to you in my opening remarks that you were trying two cases or two people at the same time. I also indicated to you during those opening remarks that there might be evidence admissible against one person alone but not against the other person. 
      
       
        It seems to me appropriate at this point in time to not only remind you of what I said the other day but to remind you that the film that you have just seen is evidence produced by the Crown only as and against Mr Brendan Fernando. Mr Wendler rose to his feet at an appropriate time, and appropriately so, to draw attention to the fact that the film evidence that you have just seen is not evidence as and against his client and he is quite correct. 
        
        Now it is appropriate for me to say to you right here and now that the film that you have just seen is not to be used by you in any way, shape or form as evidence as and against Vester Fernando. It is only evidence to be used by you against Brendan Fernando. So please do not take into account what you have seen as evidence as and against Vester Fernando. Mr Wendler, do you want me to add anything further to that? 
        
        WENDLER: No your Honour, other than there will be other occasions later in the day.” 
       
      
     237  
     Shortly after that direction the Crown Prosecutor introduced a number of photographs taken on the runaround and Mr Wendler requested that his Honour give the jury a further warning that the photos were only available in the case against Brendan Fernando. In response to that request, his Honour gave this further direction (T748): 
      
       
     “Members of the jury, once again this is evidence only in the case as and against Brendan. This material touches upon the Crown case brought against Brendan but not against Vester, so please consider it in that way and that way only.” 
      
     238  
     When interviewed by Det. Sgt. Pollock the appellant Brendan Fernando said:  
     “Vester threw it [the machete] over the levee bank.” 
      Further conversation, to which we refer elsewhere, followed as between the police officer and Brendan Fernando but before the evidence of this conversation was introduced, and again at the request of Mr Wendler, the trial judge gave the jury this warning: 
      
       
     “Members of the jury, you may recall the other day some evidence was admissible only against the accused Brendan and some evidence was only admissible as and against Vester. The conversation between the detective and Brendan Fernando, members of the jury, is to be regarded as being evidence only in the case as and against Brendan Fernando and not in the case as and against Vester.” 
      
     239  
     We consider that the directions given by the trial judge in the above passages were adequate to alert the jury as to the use they could make of the conversations and conduct of the accused Brendan Fernando, and that generally the directions from time to time in the trial, of which those set out above are instances, were adequate to remind the jury what evidence was admissible against each of the co-accused. 
      
     240  
     This ground fails. 
      
       
       (c) 
         
       Allowing the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine the witness Sharada Ann Morgan 
       
      
     241  
     In our earlier outline of the case against this appellant we referred shortly to the evidence which this witness gave. 
      
     242  
     Towards the end of her cross-examination counsel appearing for Vester Fernando directed some questions to the witness about her evidence at the hearing in the Local Court (T 431): 
      
       
     “Q. Remember you said or it was suggested to you that you said at the hearing at Dubbo, the preliminary hearing at Dubbo, that it was Vester you saw with this knife and not Brendan. Do you remember those questions a minute ago? 
      
       
        A. Yeah. 
        
        Q. Do you remember at the preliminary hearing suggesting that the thing you saw was shaped like a knife. Do you remember answering like that, page 49.40, 15 August 1995. Do you remember giving an answer like that? 
        
        A. Can you say that again? 
        
        Q. Do you remember when you gave some evidence at Dubbo. You went along to the court at Dubbo and some people asked you some questions there. Do you remember that? 
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
        Q. You were asked some questions about what you had seen and about this knife. Do you remember those questions? 
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
        Q. Do you remember saying there ‘It was shaped like a knife, that’s all I know’. Do you remember giving an answer like that? 
        
        A. No. 
        
        Q. You do not remember that at all? 
        
        A. I said it was shaped - I said - when he said to me ‘How do you know it was a knife’, I said ‘Anyone knows a knife when they see one’. That’s what I said. 
        
        Q. You also said ‘It was shaped like a knife. That’s all I know’? 
        
        A. Yes. 
        
        Q. Do you mean there that what you saw was something that was shaped like a knife? 
        
        OBJECTION (CROWN). ALLOWED. 
        
        Q. (Last question read) 
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
        Q. Well, do you agree you answered in that way at the hearing at Dubbo? 
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
        Q. I am sorry, what was that? 
        
        A. Yeah. 
        
        Q. Are you really saying that what you saw was not a knife but something that was shaped like a knife? 
        
        A. It was. 
        
        Q. You then assumed, it must have been a knife because it was shaped like that, is that right?” 
       
      
     243  
     In re-examination the Crown Prosecutor took the witness back to her evidence in the Local Court: 
      
       
     “Q. Is this what was said at the lower court. This question was put to you: 
      
       
        ‘Q. Is that the time that you say you saw Vester throw? 
        
         
          A. Yes. 
          
          Q. A knife into the bushes? 
          
          A. Yes. 
          
          Q. Could it have been something else? 
          
          A. It was shaped like a knife, that’s all I know. 
          
          Q. It was shaped like a knife? 
          
          A. Yes. 
          
          Q. So it may have been something that was shaped like a knife? 
          
          A. How can you get something shaped like a knife. 
          
          Q. I don’t know. You answer the question. 
          
          A. Uh, no. 
          
          Q. So you are saying that what you saw’ 
          
          and you answered ‘Was a knife’. Is that right? 
         
        
        A. Yeah.” 
       
      
     244  
     The re-examination was conducted without any objection being taken by Mr Wendler of counsel for the appellant so that r 4 applies. The effect of the re-examination was to elicit precisely what had been said about the object that the witness had observed when the witness had earlier given evidence before the magistrate. 
      
     245  
     It is clear that experienced counsel at the trial perceived no possible injustice to the appellant in the witness being allowed to answer what was asked in re-examination and neither does this Court. Leave to rely upon this ground of appeal is refused. 
      
       
       (d) Allowing the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine the witness Michael Jackson in chief and again in re-examination. 
        
       (e) Admitting into evidence the representation that Jackson heard the appellant say ‘If anybody grabs you, I’ll kill them’. 
        
       (f) In failing to direct the jury how they might use the representation referred to in (e) above if they were satisfied to the requisite standard that it was made. 
        
       (o) Rejecting the submission of counsel for the appellant to the effect that the evidence of the witness Michael Jackson in the circumstances had no probative value. 
       
      
     246  
     We have found it convenient to address the many issues that have arisen concerning the evidence of Michael Jackson when considering Grounds 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the appeal of Brendan Fernando. For the reasons there expressed each of these grounds concerning Michael Jackson’s evidence is rejected. 
      
       
     (g) Admitting into evidence, over objection, certain photographs 
      
     247  
     Objection was taken to the tender of a number of photographs showing the deceased’s body, and where it was found in a paddock. Counsel for both accused sought to have the photographs excluded from evidence under s 137 of the  
     Evidence Act 
     . That the photographs had probative value was conceded, but it was contended that such probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. 
      
     248  
     The trial judge gave detailed reasons for rejecting the submission that the probative value of the photographs was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and for deciding to admit the material into evidence (AB 835-847). His Honour then gave the jury an appropriate direction as to how they should view the photographic evidence (AB 822). 
      
     249  
     As Mr Ramage conceded in the course of his oral submissions, an application to exclude probative evidence of the kind here introduced on the ground addressed in s 137 presents a difficult problem for a presiding judge. In this instance, in our opinion, his Honour’s reasons disclose no error in the approach that he took to his task and the photographs were properly admitted into evidence. This ground fails. 
      
       
       (h) Admitting the evidence of Stephen Ronald Pearson of a similarity in length between the plaster cast of a footprint and shoes worn by the appellant 
       
      
     250  
     This ground is similar to ground 10 of the grounds of appeal of Brendan Fernando which we have already addressed, but the submissions presented for each appellant were not identical. Det. Snr Constable Pearson gave evidence concerning his attendance at and examination of the crime scene. He observed shoe impressions in the vicinity of the damaged vehicle belonging to Mrs Wells. He gave evidence that later he attended the No. 2 rugby oval and made a plaster cast of a barred shoe impression  
      
       
     “which bore similarities to shoe impressions seen and photographed inside the Peg Cross Ward of the Walgett Hospital and also on the ground outside that ward” (AB 879) 
      
     251  
     That plaster cast was tendered and admitted into evidence without objection. Later counsel objected to the proposed tender of evidence that the size of the prints was the same size as the appellant’s shoes, which shoes the Crown intended to identify through the appellant’s sister. It was no part of the Crown case that the shoes of the appellant matched any print found in or about the hospital. 
      
     252  
     It was submitted that the trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion and that he failed to address the requirements of s 137 of the  
     Evidence Act 
      in deciding to admit the evidence.  
      
     253  
     The evidence that Det. Constable Pearson gave was that the length of the impression recovered using the plaster cast was similar to the length of the appellant’s shoes but he was unable to match the shoe pattern with any footprint pattern observed at and about the crime scene. 
      
     254  
     That evidence having been given, it was further submitted that the trial judge should have withdrawn the plaster cast evidence from the jury’s consideration with an appropriate direction. 
      
     255  
     We are not attracted by those submissions. The transcript records that his Honour considered both ss 135 and 137 before deciding to admit the evidence, and in our opinion the exercise of discretion did not miscarry. That the appellant, Vester’s, shoe size was similar to the footprint size was relevant and probative just as a dissimilarity would have been relevant and capable of eroding the circumstantial case against the appellant. 
      
     256  
     A further discrete point was taken on the appeal that his Honour misdirected the jury as to the evidence that had been introduced when in the course of his summing up he referred to evidence that there were  
     “identical footprints in the ward, outside near the car and leading to No. 2 oval.” 
      The evidence did not go that far, as the Crown acknowledged. There was evidence of similarities in the footprints, but not of identity.  
      
     257  
     As to this misdirection on the facts, r 4 requires consideration because there was no application to the trial judge to correct what he had told the jury. It is to be observed that there was an adjournment very shortly after that factual misdirection had been given but no application was made by counsel to correct the inaccuracy. We do not consider that there was a risk of the error giving rise to any possible miscarriage of justice and it is apparent from his silence that counsel for the appellant at the trial did not regard the error as significant in the context in which it occurred. In the circumstances we refuse leave to complain of this misdirection of fact. 
      
       
       (i) Failing to direct the jury at the close of the prosecution case to bring in a verdict of acquittal on behalf of the appellant on the first count in the indictment 
       
      
     258  
     The first count charged the appellant with murder. 
      
     259  
     At the close of the Crown case Mr Wendler did make a submission that there was no case to answer, but after the trial judge indicated how he proposed to direct the jury as to the evidence of Michael Jackson, counsel withdrew that application. 
      
     260  
     This ground was not vigorously pursued on appeal and Mr Ramage acknowledged that he wavered about addressing it. In our judgment there was clearly a case for the jury’s consideration at the end of the case for the prosecution. Apart from the evidence of Michael Jackson, with which we have dealt elsewhere in this judgment, there was a case against the appellant, based upon the circumstantial evidence we outlined earlier, which was by no means a weak one. 
      
     261  
     This ground fails. 
      
       
       (j) Failing to direct the jury at the close of the prosecution case to bring in a verdict of acquittal on behalf of this appellant on the second count in the indictment. 
        
       (k) Holding that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence on which a jury could find a verdict of assault with intent. 
        
       (l) Holding that an alternative charge of assault with intent to have sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation was available against the appellant and in so directing the jury. 
        
       (m) In not requiring the prosecution to amend the indictment in respect of the second count in the indictment. 
       
      
     262  
     These four grounds are closely interwoven and it is convenient to address them together. 
      
     263  
     The second count of the indictment as presented charged the appellants with the act of sexual intercourse as an ingredient in the offence charged under s 61J of the  
     Crimes Act 
     . There was evidence by way of admission against Brendan Fernando as to what he saw this appellant do, but that evidence was not admissible against this appellant Vester Fernando. 
      
     264  
     Dr Mulvey was called in the case for the prosecution and gave evidence of having examined the body of the deceased as it lay in the paddock where it had been discovered. He observed the opening of the vagina to be enlarged, but Dr Duflou, who conducted the post mortem examination, described the enlarged opening as being a normal post mortem finding. This witness found no abnormality to the vagina. There was no evidence of the presence of semen in or on the body. Hence there was no evidence at the end of the Crown case upon which the jury could convict Vester Fernando of the offence charged. 
      
     265  
     It is submitted that in these circumstances the trial judge should have directed an acquittal of this appellant in relation to the second count. The Crown in written submissions, not earnestly pursued in oral argument, suggested it was appropriate to have such a directed acquittal delayed in case Brendan Fernando proceeded to give evidence at the trial consistent with his earlier admissions, in which event there would then have been evidence to support the second count against his co-accused. We reject that submission. The Crown was not entitled to keep the count alive merely in the hope that subsequent evidence at the trial would provide the missing link. 
      
     266  
     Absent evidence in the case for the prosecution upon which the jury could find sexual intercourse took place, this appellant was entitled to a directed acquittal of the offence charged in the second count at the close of the prosecution case. 
      
     267  
     What was the consequence of the failure of the trial judge to direct such an acquittal? The answer to this question involves consideration of s 427 of the  
     Crimes Act 
     , the evidence that was available in the Crown case and the issue of prejudice to the appellant. 
      
     268  
     Contrary to the ground expressed in (k), we consider that the evidence adduced in the case for the prosecution afforded ample evidence to support a charge against this appellant of assault with intent to have sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation. 
      
     269  
     We will not repeat the outline of the Crown case recorded at the commencement of this judgment, which assumes relevance for present purposes. We emphasise in particular that there was evidence that the body of the deceased when found was naked from the waist up, save for the material around her neck and that the underwear it was proved she had been wearing was missing. The fly of her slacks was undone, save for one of the four buttons. In the timbered area at the southern side of the No. 2 rugby oval, some distance from where the body was found, there was a disturbed area of ground approximately two metres long and half a metre wide. At one end of that disturbed area there were two distinct impressions 300 mm apart. At the other end of the depression there was a single larger impression within which the deceased’s hair elastic was found. At the edge of that depression was a pair of scissors with the name “Sandra” attached to a handle. There was also discovered there a lens cleaning cloth. A button was found in the disturbed area identical in size to the buttons in the piece of blouse found tied around the neck of the deceased. The cotton thread attached to that button was identical to the cotton on the blouse. Then there was the evidence of footprints leading to and from that disturbed area. 
      
     270  
     Ground (k) is not sustained and it follows from this that the evidence that had been adduced in the case for the prosecution sufficed to prove an alternative offence for the purposes of s 427 of the  
     Crimes Act 
     , namely that of assault with intent to commit aggravated sexual assault. Ground (l) raises the question as to whether the judge was wrong to allow such an alternative offence to be considered by the jury when it was being raised by the Crown for the first time immediately after the close of its case. 
      
     271  
     The trial judge gave detailed reasons (appearing at AB 1229-1243) before deciding that this alternative offence ought go to the jury. We find no error in his Honour’s reasons. 
      
     272  
     It is desirable generally where there are alternative verdicts to which a jury may come that this be raised in the opening address of the Crown: see  
     R v Cameron 
      (1983) 2 NSWLR 66 and  
     R v Pureau 
      (1990) 19 NSWLR 372. However there is no rigid rule that this must occur in every case. In  
     Pureau 
      Hunt J, with whose judgment the other members of the court agreed, said at 376: 
      
       
     “The issue of alternative verdicts should be opened to the jury by the Crown. If the alternative verdict is not referred to [then], it must be raised before closing addresses when the judge can rule whether the delay in raising it so late in the piece would be likely to cause injustice to the accused.” 
      
     273  
     What is important is that consideration of the alternative offence is not introduced in circumstances which would cause injustice to the accused:  
     Pureau  
     (supra) and  
     R v Quinn 
      (1991) 55 A Crim R 435. His Honour was plainly alert to this critical consideration as his reasons disclose. His Honour considered the question of prejudice and concluded, in our view correctly, that the appellant was not prejudiced by the introduction of the alternative charge at a time immediately after the conclusion of the case for the Crown. We would add, as the discussion recorded in the transcript at the conclusion of his Honour’s reasons discloses, that counsel for this appellant was invited to seek to have witnesses recalled if he so wished to put any additional matters to them concerning the alternative offence under s 427. 
      
     274  
     In our opinion grounds (k) and (l) both fail. We have earlier expressed the opinion that the appellant would have been entitled to an acquittal at the end of the Crown case on the second count as framed but equally it would have been appropriate for the indictment to have been amended to charge the offence of assault with intent to commit aggravated sexual assault. 
      
     275  
     Whilst neither of those two steps were taken, the trial judge gave to the jury the following instruction before the trial proceeded any further (AB 1280): 
      
       
     “As you may recall, there are two cases that are being tried or heard together against the two accused, that is, taking place at the same time. You also recall that I directed you that you have to consider each case against each accused separately. I remind you at this point of time of a warning, a direction, that I have given from time to time, that what was allegedly said out of court by the accused Brendan Fernando by way of admissions to the police or by way of pointing things out or making observations to the police is only admissible in the case as and against him and not in the case as and against Vester Fernando. In other words, what he said by way of admissions is admissible in evidence as and against him, but not as evidence in the case against Vester and cannot be used by you as such. 
      
       
        I have given that direction something along those lines before, but it is appropriate for me to repeat it. It is appropriate for me to move onto something else and tell you that the Crown case not only has closed, but that in respect of the second count, the Crown has conceded that at the close of its case as and against Vester Fernando that there is no evidence of sexual penetration by the accused Vester Fernando or any other person and that sexual penetration is an essential ingredient in the second count, but that the Crown will seek to satisfy you that the accused Vester Fernando is guilty of an assault with intent to have sexual intercourse with Sandra Hoare without her consent, knowing she did not consent, in circumstances of aggravation, that he, Vester Fernando, was in the company of Brendan Fernando. It will be necessary to, in due course when I sum up, to give you some further direction.” 
       
      
     276  
     Subsequently at the commencement of his summing up his Honour directed the jury it must acquit this appellant of aggravated sexual assault in the context of giving the following direction (AB 1532): 
      
       
     “It is appropriate if I direct you now that in respect of the second count in the indictment against Vester Fernando, that is, of aggravated sexual assault, you must find the accused not guilty. But if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on 9 December 1994 at Walgett in the State of New South Wales Vester Fernando did assault Sandra Hoare without consent of Sandra Hoare, knowing that she was not consenting thereto, and in circumstances of aggravation, 
       
     namely, being in the company of Brendan Fernando, then you may find the accused Vester Fernando guilty of such an offence of assault with intent to commit the offence of aggravated sexual assault. It will be necessary for you to determine whether or not the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt the charge to which I have just referred.” 
      
     277  
     On a later return to this topic concerning the assault with intent, he gave the jury the following directions (AB 1626): 
      
       
     “In respect of the charge against Vester, and that is the one that I have spoken about of which you are entitled to consider, that of assault with intent to have sexual intercourse without consent and in the circumstances of aggravation, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proved its case, you may then find him guilty of that offence. I have already dealt with the elements in it. That charge is like the charge of murder against Vester. Based on circumstantial evidence the Crown must prove that there was an assault, that is an unlawful act which intentionally caused Sandra Hoare and to apprehend immediate unlawful violence upon her. An assault can be committed without even a touching of another person, but an assault can include touching of a person or that person with hostile intent in order to sustain the charge. In this charge as and against the accused Vester, the Crown would have to prove that not only was there such an assault or act on the part of Vester which it says there was or took place at this southern end of the Number 2 oval, but accompanying that action by Vester was an intention to have sexual intercourse with Sandra Hoare. Sexual intercourse meaning, in law, in this case, penetration of the female vagina by his penis to any extent without her consent knowing that she was not consenting and would not be consenting to any sexual intercourse taking place and that at that time he was in the c",1999-04-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

   ORDERS: 
   The conviction is annulled and a fresh hearing date will be set. 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
   
    
   1    The applicant Mimi Ange was charged and convicted of ten offences relating to possession of illegal pornographic films. She was not present at court on the date of her conviction. She has made an application for an annulment of those convictions, and this is opposed.  
    2    The respondent, a police officer, is represented in this matter by the New South Wales Crown Solicitors Office, instructing Mr Craddock SC. What would ordinarily be a simple and straightforward application has become somewhat of a legal feast, with counsel debating the fine points of hearsay evidence, witnesses including a solicitor and accountant cross examined and lengthy analysis of s8 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeals and Review) Act 2001:  
     
      
       
       8 Circumstances in which applications to be granted  
        
       (1) A Local Court must grant an application for annulment made by the prosecutor if it is satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, there is just cause for doing so.  
       (2) A Local Court must grant an application for annulment made by the defendant if it is satisfied:  
        
         
         (a) that the defendant was not aware of the original Local Court proceedings until after the proceedings were completed, or  
          
         (b) that the defendant was otherwise hindered by accident, illness, misadventure or other cause from taking action in relation to the original Local Court proceedings, or  
         (c) that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, it is in the interests of justice to do so.  
         
         
        
       
      
    3    Mimi Ange relies on each of (b) and (c), however for reasons that will become clear it is only necessary to consider (c). Thus the issue is whether I am satisfied on balance that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, it is in the interests of justice to grant the application.  
     
      
     Review of the Law 
      
      
    4    There are competing interests of justice in this context - it is generally in the interests of justice that there be finality of criminal matters before the court, and that where a defendant is convicted in their absence, having been given an opportunity to attend, that in the ordinary course of events they cannot get “a second bite at the cherry” without good reason. On the other hand, it is inevitable for a variety of reasons that such a conviction ought be annulled where there are good reasons so that a defendant has the opportunity to put the prosecution to proof of the case, be heard on penalty or otherwise defend the matter. It is the fundamental duty of the court to hear the matters brought before it, and to have each party present their case as an integral part of that hearing. It is also fundamental that the court should not lightly allow a conviction, with all the consequences and public opprobrium that can bring, unless they have had appropriate opportunity to present their case. 5    The history of one of the predecessors to s8 was considered by Young CJ in EQ in Miller v Director of Public Prosecutions [2004] NSWCA 90 at 32 and I have emphasized a portion in bold.  
     
      
       
       I have read the draft judgment of Sheller JA and I entirely agree with it. However, I believe that I should add some remarks of my own because as a result of the argument on this appeal it seems to me that there would be merit in the appropriate authorities considering whether  
       Part 4A 
        of the  
       Justices Act 
        1902 
       , which has now been re-enacted as Part 2 of the  
       Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 
         
       2001, needs to be considered as to whether it has the effect the legislature would intend it to have.  
        
       Up until Act No 28 of 1967, there was no redress available to a person who had been convicted in what was then a Court of Petty Sessions if that person had not become aware of that conviction within the 28 day period in which there could be a rehearing in the District Court. The only avenue of redress was to petition the Governor for a pardon which, in an appropriate case, the Governor would graciously give, though usually with an order for retrial.  
       The initial amendments had their problems (cf the Commentary in (1971) Petty Sessions Review Vol 2 p 643). Further, it was held in McLachlan v Pilgrim (1980) 5 Petty Sessions Review 2182 per Yeldham J that the then sections 100A and 100B were the only ways of annulling a magistrate's conviction.  
       There were a number of minor amendments up until 1997 when the Part was recast by the Justices Amendment (Procedure) Act 1997 No 107.  
       As Sheller JA has pointed out, the Second Reading Speech gives the clear impression that the aim of the amendments was to liberalize the circumstances in which convictions before magistrates where the accused had not appeared could be annulled.  
       Under the 1967 legislation, the Act covered a series of discrete situations including where the accused was not aware of the adjourned hearing date.  
       However, under s100K (2)(a), the defendant can apply if he or she was not aware of the relevant proceedings until after their completion, but cases where there was some problem with communication of the adjourned date or a date was wrongly written down in somebody's diary ceased to be matters explicitly mentioned in the statute.  
       This must lead to the view that the general paragraphs of subsection (2)(b) and (c) of s 100K (2) or s 8(2) of the 2001 Act should be widely construed. Thus in (b) the word ""misadventure"" should be read widely.  
       Further, it is significant that the word ""hindered"" is used. Although Martin J said in Hogben v Chandler [1940] VLR 285, 288, that ""hindered"" ""is a somewhat vague term"", it nonetheless clearly means something less than prevention, namely making something more or less difficult but not impossible (per Lord Atkinson Tennants (Lancashire) Ltd v Wilson (CS) & Co Ltd [1917] AC 495, 518). Alternatively, as Lord Dunedin put in the same case, the word has ""the general sense of in any way affecting to an appreciable extent"" the activity in question, a statement which was approved by Mason J in the High Court in Devenish v Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd (1991) 172 CLR 32, 45.  
       
       
      
    6    There has been no detailed consideration of s8(2)(c) since its introduction, but in my view there are a number of factors that the court ought consider in balancing the interests of justice. Although not directly comparative, some assistance can be obtained from civil law. In Akari v Sole [2008] NSWSC 59 Hall J at 29 restated in cogent terms the law relating to the exercise of the discretion to set aside default judgment:  
     
      
       
       Accordingly, in general terms, the relevant matters to be addressed on an application to set aside a default judgment include the issues of delay, and explanation for any delay or default which occasioned the entry of default judgment, whether a defence on the merits has been established and the question of whether any prejudice would be occasioned to the plaintiff by the making of an order setting aside the judgment.  
       
       
      
    7    In the context of s8(2)(c), it seems to me that the following factors may be of relevance in determining an application: prejudice to the prosecution, explanation for non-attendance, the availability of any defence and the seriousness of the matter or the penalty. This is of course not an exclusive list.  
    8    Firstly, to deal with prejudice. One can imagine that there are criminal cases where there is a very real prejudice in allowing the conviction to be annulled - for example where evidence has been destroyed following conviction. A further example is where there is a victim to a violent crime who, primed for the turmoil of giving evidence, is unlikely to want to give evidence again. A further example could be when there is a significant period between the conviction and the annulment application so that witnesses memories have faded, identification will be more difficult, witnesses have now left the jurisdiction, have died or otherwise have become unavailable. On the other hand, where none of these factors are present, the prejudice to the prosecution cannot be said to be great. 9    Secondly, to deal with an explanation for non-attendance, there will be cases where it is obvious that the defendant themselves are blameless. Often the hearing date is set down when the defendant is not present, and human nature dictates that the defendant can be told the wrong date. Courts tend to be relatively sympathetic to s8 applications where lawyers fall on their sword and take the blame for a miscommunication. Less blameless are the defendants who simply forgot, or change address without notification.  
    10    An example of the latter is in Rakavina v DPP [2008] NSW DC 214 per Bennett DCJ. In that case the applicant had not attended court because he mistook the date for another, and had lost his bail adjournment notice. He supplied medical certificates on the application to the effect that he suffered from poor memory as a result of an injury. He conceded that he ought to have telephoned the court to check the dates. The court quoted from Miller v DPP and concluded that whilst the legislation had been amended since, that ss4 - 8 “have not reversed or introduced limitations to that liberalization”. The court found that an error resulting in a genuine belief constituted a hindrance by misadventure and thus the Local Court ought to have granted the annulment as sought. At paragraph 63 the court found: 
     
      
       
       “However, as the Court of Appeal has made abundantly clear, the legislation was not intended to produce injustice. Those accused who wish to defend the charges brought against them must be permitted to do so. The strength of the Crown Case was an irrelevant consideration to the question whether the annulment ought to have been granted. Even those facing what might be an overwhelming case are entitled to have the prosecution prove the charges brought. That said, there might in some cases be scope for the consideration of the strength of the Crown case when assessing the credibility and reliability of the evidence of an applicant….” 
       
       
      
    11    This segues neatly into the issue of potential defence on which there is no clear position from the District Court. There are cases where it is clear that the defendant has no real defence to the case at all. Cases involving drink driving, absolute liability cases and speed camera offences are examples of this where it is difficult to imagine that the defendant has any arguable defence, and the prospect of time wasting looms large. On the other hand, there are cases where the defence is clearly outlined in the application, and is not only arguable, but seemingly strong. As was said in Gino Robert Cassaniti v Director of Public Prosecutions [2008] NSWDC 2 (25 January 2008) per Nicholson DCJ at 17  
     
      
       
       ""in circumstances where the applicants chances of non-conviction in the Local Court on these two charges had no prospects of success there would be little point in annulling the convictions""  
       
       
      
    12    In the latter case involving a taxation offence, the court found that whilst many other factors weighed in favour of the applicant, that as the offence was absolute, there were simply no prospects of success in defending the matter, and thus did not annul the convictions.  
    13    As to penalty, in many cases it will be difficult to assess - a person without a criminal record may view any conviction as serious. Demerit points are crucial to some defendants’ ability to earn a living. Certainly where a large fine has been imposed to the extent that the consequences could be crippling, that will tend to support an application for annulment, especially where the person has no prior convictions.  
     
      
     Application to this Case 
    14    From the affidavits, other exhibits, and submissions in this matter there are a number of facts not in issue. The applicant was married to Con Ange in 1991. She had some involvement with his adult products shops until she had children, however that faded whereupon he ran the business alone. During that time she would sign papers from time to time, but trusted him regarding the contents. Thus Mimi Ange was the lessee of the premises in Penrith upon which the films were located, but had signed the original lease in about 1992. She had been to the premises about 12 or 13 years ago, but not since.  
    15    The charges relate to possession in 2005, and she separated from her husband in December 2007. The proceedings became delayed as search warrants were challenged in the Supreme Court (Ange v Kraus [2008] NSWSC 86). Mimi Ange and Con Ange instructed a lawyer, Mr Malcolm McDonald to represent them both, but her involvement in the case was minimal, and she did not attend at the Supreme Court. Representations were made to the prosecutor to withdraw the charges, based upon a defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact. The offences were strict liability, but the written representations detail her lack of knowledge of possession of the items given her limited involvement in the business.  
    16    She did not attend on the date the matter was set down for hearing, although her lawyer, via an agent, did. He withdrew from appearing for the applicant, but not for her husband Con Ange. On behalf of Con Ange, an adjournment was sought and refused. Mimi Ange’s matters were dealt with ex parte, she was convicted and fined the sum of $25,000. She has no prior convictions.  
    17    The films are still in existence, the crime is not one involving a victim, the principal witnesses are police officers, and no issue will be taken by the defence as to the nature of the material – that is those elements of the offence are conceded.  
    18    On the criteria listed above, it is clear that the applicant has satisfied the court that the penalty was significant, the charges were serious and she has an arguable defence. She instructed a solicitor, and once convictions had been entered promptly filed the present application. Apart from minimal delay and the need to prepare again for hearing, there is no prejudice to the prosecution should the matter be annulled.  
    19    Thus the only issue is whether she was notified of the hearing date.  
    20    The applicant in sworn testimony says that she was not aware of the hearing date, and that she had effectively lost track of the proceedings post separation, but was still relying on Con Ange and the lawyer to advise her of any requirements she had to meet. Her relationship with Con had broken down and there was an AVO involved, however he still did come to the house to collect the mail. She was not involved in the Supreme Court action in a direct sense – she did not give evidence or attend court. Under cross examination she could not remember items of communication said to be faxed by her relating to earlier mentions of the matters, and she denied key details of contact leading up to the hearing date. Indeed, it was clear from the accountant and the lawyer, both of whom were called to give evidence, that Con Ange was the contact person and the driver of the legal action and the business. The lawyer was unaware of the separation, and communication was generally care of the Penrith office operated by Con Ange. There is no direct evidence that the hearing date was ever brought to Mimi Ange’s attention. There are file notes detailing attempted contact, but it is unclear as to how or to whom these were directed. At best, from the lawyer’s file and evidence in the bill of costs, the solicitor’s contact was limited to a conversation and a fax in May 2008. His staff, who were not called, may have attempted more.  
    21    The applicant is a witness with a very limited command of English who was assisted through her evidence by an interpreter. She was overwhelmed by the proceedings, and in my view did her best to answer questions honestly. She did not deny the matters put to her by Mr Craddock SC regarding contacts, however said that she could not remember some of them. Sometimes this answer can be indicative of dishonesty or convenience, however in this case, in my view, it was more likely to be a genuine difficulty in remembering. Clearly, she relied on her husband and her solicitor to manage the matters, and trusted that they would do so in her best interests.  
    22    On the other hand Mr Craddock SC argues that the courts ought to demand a requisite level of personal responsibility. The defendant knew that the proceedings were on foot, knew that there was a mention in May, and was insufficiently concerned about matters to follow them up properly. Mr Craddock SC contends that a defendant cannot simply close their eyes to the proceedings and hope that they will be handled. The respondent conceded that there was no direct evidence that she was contacted about the hearing date.  
    23    In my view, the standards suggested by Mr Craddock are not supported by any authority or the legislative intent. Certainly, in retrospect the applicant could have and should have done more, but the test is not to assess her blameworthiness in isolation. The applicant has received a huge fine, a criminal conviction for a serious matter in circumstances where there was a breakdown of communication in a lengthy criminal matter where she was not directly advised of the hearing date. Her lawyer was not even aware of the separation, let alone of her specific contact details. There is no significant prejudice to the prosecution and there is, at least, an arguable defence. The defendant previously had no criminal record, and gave honest if confused evidence on the application.  
    24    In those circumstances I am satisfied that having regard to the circumstances of the case, it is in the interests of justice to annul the conviction. It is thus unnecessary to consider s8(2)(b). 25    The conviction is annulled and a fresh hearing date will be set.  
    26    I will hear the parties on costs, but my preliminary view is that I agree with the submissions of the applicant that costs will be costs in the cause.

    THE LAND AND ENVIRONMENT COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESPRESTON CJ30 April 200960016 of 200860017 of 2008Zhou v Auburn City CouncilChen v Auburn City CouncilJUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The applicants in each of these proceedings appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed by Magistrate Johnson of the Local Court of New South Wales in proceedings brought by Auburn City Council for a contravention of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) (“EPA Act”). The offences involved a failure to comply with two orders pursuant to s 121B of the EPA Act in respect of two residential flat units that the applicants jointly owned. The applicants pleaded guilty to each of the offences and the proceedings came before the Local Court on 24 October 2008. The Local Court convicted the applicants and sentenced each of the applicants on each of the court attendance notices. The sentences were as follows:  
     
      -  
     Zhou - offence relating to unit 5042 - breach of order 2 - convicted and fined $15,000, court costs of $73 and professional costs of $350. 
      
      -  
     Zhou - offence relating to unit 5042 - breach of order 12 - convicted and fined $10,000, court costs of $73 and professional costs of $350. 
      
      -  
     Zhou - offence relating to unit 4513 - breach of order 2 - convicted and fined $15,000, court costs of $73 and professional costs of $350. 
      
      -  
     Zhou - offence relating to unit 4513 - breach of order 12 - convicted and fined $10,000, court costs of $73 and professional costs of $350. 
      
      -  
     Chen - offence relating to unit 5042 - breach of order 2 - convicted and fined $15,000, court costs of $73 and professional costs of $350. 
      
      -  
     Chen - offence relating to unit 5042 - breach of order 12 - convicted and fined $10,000, court costs of $73 and professional costs of $350. 
      
      -  
     Chen - offence relating to unit 4513 - breach of order 2 - convicted and fined $15,000, court costs of $73 and professional costs of $350. 
      
      -  
     Chen - offence relating to unit 4513 - breach of order 12 - convicted and fined $10,000, court costs of $73 and professional costs of $350. 
    2 It can be seen, therefore, that each of the applicants, Ms Zhou and Mr Chen, were fined in total $50,000 plus court costs and professional costs in respect of the four summonses relating to them. Each of the applicants says that the total fines are too severe and beyond what is just and appropriate for the criminality involved.The offence provisions 
     
      
    3 The offences against each of the applicants involve a failure to comply with orders issued under s 121B of the EPA Act. The two orders were orders in items 2 and 12 of the table to s 121B of the EPA Act. Order 2 requires the person to whom the order is given to remove unauthorised building works specified in the order. These unauthorised building works included additional walls, partitions, plumbing and electrical works in each of the two residential units owned by the applicants. Order 12 requires each of the applicants to restore the residential flat units to the condition in which they were before the unlawful building works were carried out. 4 The offence in each case was failing to comply with each of these orders within the time period specified in the orders. Appeal against the sentence5 The applicants appealed against the severity of the sentences as of right under s 31(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (“Appeal and Review Act”). Such an appeal is dealt with by way of rehearing on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the Local Court: s 37(1) of the Appeal and Review Act. Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of this court if the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that fresh evidence be given: s 37(2) of the Appeal and Review Act. The evidence on the appeal6 The appeal proceeded on the basis of the evidence that was before the Local Court, namely: 
     
      
       
      (a) the statement of Jason Mooney dated 3 July 2008 which related to unit 4513; 
       
       
      (b) the statement of Jason Mooney dated 3 July 2008 which related to unit 5042; 
       
       
      (c) a reference from Ms Queeny M K Liu dated 23 October 2008; 
       
       
      (d) a reference from Naxin Jiang dated 20 October 2008; 
       
       
      (e) a transcript of the proceedings in the Local Court on 24 October 2008. 
      
    7 The applicants also sought leave under s 37(2) of the Appeal and Review Act to adduce fresh evidence in the form of two affidavits, one from each of the applicants. The respondent did not oppose leave being granted to the applicants to read those affidavits on the appeal. Having been satisfied that it was in the interests of justice I granted leave to the applicants to read the affidavit of Mr Chen sworn 25 March 2009 and the affidavit of Ms Zhou also sworn 25 March 2009 in each appeal.The incident8 Mr Chen and Ms Zhou are married. They purchased the two units the subject of the offences off the plan in a residential flat building which was being developed in Auburn. The first unit, unit 4513, was purchased in June 2003. The second unit, unit 5042, was purchased in 2005. The circumstances in which Mr Chen and Ms Zhou purchased the second unit are relevant to how the offences were committed. 9 Mr Chen and Ms Zhou state in their affidavits that they were contacted by Mr Justin Wong in mid-2004 about purchasing a second unit off the plan for the development. Mr Chen and Ms Zhou were concerned about the financial consequences of purchasing a second unit. However, Mr Wong said that “I can make you more money by increasing the number of bedrooms in your unit.” Mr Wong gave examples about other properties that he was associated with in the residential flat building complex where the internal size of the units had been increased so as to improve the return to their owners. Mr Wong told Mr Chen and Ms Zhou that he could make five bedrooms from each three-bedroom apartment. 10 Mr Wong introduced Mr Chen and Ms Zhou to another person, a Mr Danny King. Mr Chen and Ms Zhou were told that Mr King worked for Raylan Property Services Pty Limited with Mr Wong. 11 After the conversation with Mr Wong, Mr Chen and Ms Zhou discussed the matter and they made a decision to purchase a second unit off the plan. They entered into a new contract for the purchase of the second unit. Settlement for the second unit was to occur on 26 May 2005. Shortly prior to settlement taking place, Mr King arranged for a tradesman to carry out the internal works designed to turn each of the three-bedroom apartments into five bedroom apartments. Mr Chen paid $5,500 cash to Mr King for the work. 12 After the work was carried out, Mr King looked after rental of the property. The rental for each of the units was apparently around $590 per week. This was a rental on the basis that each of the units had five bedrooms. Mr Chen and Ms Zhou stated that if the bedrooms had remained at three bedrooms the rental would have been lower, some $450 per week. Although it is not clear as to the precise time when each of the units were let, it would seem that they were let shortly after the works to the apartments were completed. This would have been in mid-2005.13 All of the rent collected for the two units of Mr Chen and Ms Zhou was put into their mutual bank account. 14 The council, upon becoming aware that illegal works had been carried out in the units owned by Mr Chen and Ms Zhou, issued a notice of intention to give an order. In the case of unit 4513 the notice of intention was issued on 11 October 2007 whilst in the case of unit 5402 the notice of intention was issued on 15 February 2008. The notices of intention were forwarded to the residential address of Mr Chen and Ms Zhou, namely 43 Norval Street, Auburn. Mr Chen and Ms Zhou did not respond to the notices of intention. Mr Chen and Ms Zhou say that on occasions they have had difficulty with the mail. They also say that Ms Zhou was pregnant with their second child and it may have been that they simply overlooked the notices from the council. Whether the notices were received or noticed by Mr Chen and Ms Zhou or not, certainly they took no action in response to the notices.15 The council then issued formal orders under s 121B, order 2 and order 12. In the case of unit 4513 the order was issued on 6 November 2007 whilst in the case of unit 5042 the order was issued on 4 March 2008.16 Again Mr Chen and Ms Zhou did not take any action in response to the orders. Again Mr Chen and Ms Zhou give as a reason for their inaction that they had had difficulties with the mail or again they may have just overlooked the mail due to the fact that Ms Zhou was pregnant with their second child. There being no response by Mr Chen and Ms Zhou the council commenced the prosecutions by way of court attendance notices. The prosecutions were commenced in July 2008. 17 Mr Chen and Ms Zhou were ultimately spurred into action and they took steps to carry out the work required by the orders to remove the illegal works and restore each of the units back to the condition they should have been in before the illegal works were carried out. These works were done in August 2008. Mr Chen states that the rectification works carried out in August 2008 cost $3,500. It is common ground that the works rectified the illegality in respect of each unit.18 Mr Chen and Ms Zhou state in their affidavits that they were unaware of the need to seek council permission to carry out internal works and for that reason they did not make any enquiries of the council. They state that they now accept that that assumption was incorrect and that they should have contacted the council before carrying out the works. The appropriate sentence19 On a re-hearing of the matters by this Court, the Court should determine for itself the appropriate sentence that should be imposed for each of the offences. In determining the appropriate sentence the Court should take into account both the objective gravity of the offences together with the subjective circumstances of each applicant. There also needs to be a final check to see whether the sentences that would result for each offence, when considered in aggregate, result in a penalty that is just and appropriate and proportionate to the overall criminality involved.Objective gravity 
     
      
    20 In determining the objective gravity of the offences it is appropriate for the Court to have regard to the maximum penalty for the offence, the objective harmfulness of each applicant’s actions, the applicant’s state of mind in committing the offences and the applicant’s reasons for committing the offences.Maximum penalty21 The maximum penalty for an offence against the EPA Act is $1.1 million. It needs to be remembered, however, that that maximum penalty applies to all conduct that constitutes an offence against the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. There is a diverse range of conduct that can constitute an offence against the EPA Act.Objective harmfulness of the applicants’ actions22 In relation to the objective harmfulness of the applicants’ actions, the following circumstances are relevant: 
     
      
      (a) Each of the units are owned by Mr Chen and Ms Zhou. They were originally built as three bedroom units. The two additional bedrooms that were constructed were in an area that was designed as a living area but each bedroom had a door lock and each door had a number on it, indicating a separate domicile. The additional rooms contained a number of beds. Such works would have required development consent under the EPA Act, but no development consent was sought or obtained.  
       
       
      (b) The additional bedrooms constructed were not compliant with the Building Code of Australia. The construction of the two additional bedrooms and the location of those bedrooms in each unit resulted in the occupants having unacceptable amenity with regards to the available living area and space. 
       
       
      (c) The locked bedrooms could have led to injury or possible death in the event of a fire occurring in the unit. 
       
       
      (d) Whilst the works to demolish the additional rooms and restore the unit to its original condition were eventually carried out, the works were not carried out until such time as the council had commenced proceedings against the applicants. 
       
       
      (e) The works were carried out for the purposes of financial gain and without regard to the potential public safety of the occupants. 
      
    The applicants’ state of mind23 The works that were carried out on the instructions of Mr Chen and Ms Zhou involved a deliberate decision of Mr Chen and Ms Zhou. However, they said they did know it was illegal. They said, and there is no evidence from the prosecutor to the contrary, that they were unaware of the legal requirement to obtain consent for the carrying out of the internal works. No doubt they relied upon the representations of those persons who wished to sell the unit to Mr Chen and Ms Zhou, that such works could be carried out.24 Nevertheless ignorance of the law, of course, is no defence. As has been said in many cases the system of planning and development control established under the EPA Act depends on persons taking steps to obey the law by ascertaining when development consent is required and then obtaining development consent before carrying out development.25 Accordingly, in was incumbent upon the applicants to have made proper inquiries to ascertain what constituted development and whether development consent was needed for such development.26 In sentencing, the purpose of general deterrence is important. There is a need for general deterrence for offences against the EPA Act.27 In particular there is a need for general deterrence so others, like the applicants in this case, will be put on notice that they are obliged to make the necessary inquiries about the need to obtain development consent before carrying out works and, if needed, obtain the requisite development consent.The applicants’ reasons for committing the offence28 The applicants, Mr Chen and Ms Zhou, were induced to purchase the second unit by the representation that internal works could be carried out to not only the second unit but also the unit they had already purchased, to convert the units to five bedroom units and, thereby, receive increased rent.29 It was the belief that they would receive greater rental from carrying out the works to the units that persuaded Mr Chen and Ms Zhou to purchase the second unit. Indeed, the representations that there would be increased rent proved to be correct. The rent that was received for a period of about three years for each of the units was $590 a week instead of $450 a week, an increase of $140 from what would otherwise have been received.30 Accordingly, there was a financial reason for committing the offence and the appellants have profited from committing the offences. In approximate terms, Mr Chen and Ms Zhou have jointly received increased rent of $140 a week for fifty-two weeks for three years for two units which equates to over $40,000.31 Of course, off this increase in income must be taken the expenses associated with carrying out the original works and the restoration works. These total $9,000, being $5,500 for the original works and $3,500 for the restoration works. That gives a net profit of $31,000 to Mr Chen and Ms Zhou over the period.32 This profit that the applicants have received by reason of commission of the offence should be taken into account in determining the appropriate penalty. Offenders should not profit from their crimes.33 The applicants do submit, however, that the court should also take into account the fact that the evidence as to the profit that has been received by the applicants is only before the court as a result of the full disclosure made by the applicants. I will come later to deal with the mitigating factors in relation to the assistance provided by the applicants to the prosecutor and their contrition and remorse. However, I note at this stage that the applicants submit that what would otherwise clearly be an aggravating factor, namely, the profit that has been received by commission of the crime, should be discounted in the circumstances of this case where it is the evidence of the applicants that enabled the court to be aware of that profit.Subjective circumstances of the applicants34 A proportionate sentence depends not only on the objective circumstances of each of the offences but also on the subjective circumstances of the particular offenders.35 The subjective circumstances of the applicants that ought to be considered in this case include the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) Neither of the applicants has any prior criminal record; 
       
       
      (b) The applicants are persons of good character, as evidenced by the references tendered in evidence; 
       
       
      (c) The applicants are unlikely to re-offend; 
       
       
      (d) Each of the applicants has expressed remorse for their conduct. Each has stated that they feel ashamed for having committed the offences and having to face court and state that they will never commit such an offence again; 
       
       
      (e) Each of the applicants has entered a plea of guilty at the earliest practical opportunity. Consistent with authorities, the utilitarian value of such an early plea is high. It should be given a discount at the top of the range, namely 25%; 
       
       
      (f) The degree of pre-trial disclosure by the applicants. The applicants were forthcoming in providing information to the council’s investigating officer, including information concerning the circumstances that led to their conduct that constitutes the offence and the profit that they have received by way of increased rental. The preparedness of the applicants to provide this information is evidence of their remorse as well as, of course, providing assistance to the prosecutor; 
       
       
      (g) The assistance that has been provided to the prosecutor by the applicants, including not only the pre-trial disclosure, but also the offer that the applicants made to provide information and give evidence in any investigation or proceedings that might be brought by the council against the developers and those who were selling the units to persons such as Mr Chen and Miss Zhou. 
      
    Synthesis of objective and subjective factors36 Taking into account each of the objective circumstances of the offences and the subjective circumstances of each of the applicants, and allowing a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, the appropriate penalties for each of the offences would be as follows:  
     
      -  
     For the offences in relation to unit 4513, the penalty for the offence against order 2 would be $14,000 and against order 12 would be $8,500.  
      
      -  
     For the offences in relation to unit 5042, the penalty for the offence against order 2 would be $14,000 and against order 12 would be $8,500.  
    This would amount to an aggregate penalty for each of the applicants of $45,000. Totality principle 37 However, where there are multiple offences and where the offences can be seen to be part of the same course of conduct, the totality principle must also be taken into account. At least three issues of totality need to be addressed in the circumstances of this case. 38 First, there is the fact that the two orders under 121B, namely orders 2 and 12, were in the one notice that was issued to the applicants. Furthermore, when one looks at the nature of the works that were required by these orders, they are essentially the same works. What both orders required was to remove the unauthorised building works so as to restore each of the residential flat units to the condition they were in before the illegal works were carried out. True it is, in the way in which the table to s 121B and the particular items 2 and 12 are drawn, a distinction is made. But in the circumstances of this case, if one looks in a practical way at what the council was endeavouring to achieve by way of issuing the orders under s 121B, it was to return each of the units to the condition they were in before the illegal works of creating the two extra bedrooms had been carried out.39 Secondly, although there were two units involved, there was single course of criminal conduct by the applicants. There relevantly was no difference in the way in which the applicants dealt with the two units. The works that were done to convert the three bedroom units to five bedroom units were done for both units. They were done at the same time. They were done as a result of the same representations by the developers of the residential flat building in response to the same decision by the applicants. The same payment was made in the one sum. Although the criminality involved in converting two units from three bedroom units to five bedroom units is greater than if only one unit had been done, nevertheless it should be recognised that the criminal conduct was part of the same course of conduct.40 Thirdly, it needs to be recognised that the applicants are in a relationship with one another, both marital and financial. The applicants have the one bank account. They have the one business which is a shop. They both work in the shop that is their principal source of income. They do own property, but again, the property is in their joint names and the income received from the properties goes into the joint account. There needs to be a recognition that penalties imposed upon one of the applicants has a consequence on the other applicant by reason of this relationship between them, and of course, vice versa.41 Having regard to the principle of totality, I consider that an aggregate penalty of $45,000 for each of the applicants would be greater than that which is just and appropriate and would be disproportionate to the overall criminality involved. There ought to be an adjustment to that aggregate amount so as to bring the penalty to an amount which is just and appropriate and in proportion to the criminality involved in the commission of these offences.42 In my opinion, the appropriate adjustment is to reduce the aggregate penalty for each of the applicants to an amount of $30,000 each. This amount should be apportioned as follows:  
     
      -  
     For the offences in relation to unit 4513, in relation to order 2 the amount should be $9,300, and in relation to order 12, the amount should be $5,700.  
      
      -  
     In relation to the offences against unit 5042, in relation to order 2, the amount should be $9,300 and in relation to order 12, the amount should be $5,700.  
    Such amounts and apportionments should apply to each of the appellants. 43 Accordingly, the appeals by each of the applicants should be upheld and the penalties imposed by the Local Court should be set aside and, in lieu, penalties in the amounts that I have stated should be imposed. The Local Court also made orders requiring the applicants to pay court costs and professional costs in each of the offences. Those orders are appropriate and should not be set aside.44 In relation to the costs of the appeals to this court, the applicants, very fairly, accepted that, if they succeeded in the appeal, it was appropriate that there be no order as to the costs of the appeal. The council did not oppose such a course.45 Accordingly, the court orders are as follows:   
     
      -  
     In proceedings number 08/60016 Zhou v Auburn City Council, I make the following orders:

    HOLROYD CITY COUNCIL V GEORGE GHANNOUM 
     
      
       
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
        
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Mr George Ghannoum has pleaded guilty to committing an offence against s 125(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 in that he carried out development without first obtaining a development consent as required by s 76A(1) of that Act. A hearing on sentence has been held today. The parties have agreed to a statement of agreed facts which has been tendered. 
     
      
       
      
    2 Mr Ghannoum has given oral evidence covering, among other matters his involvement in the subject offence, his personal circumstances, his financial situation, the costs associated with filling in the excavated area the subject of the proceedings, and moneys foregone by the delay in erecting the approved dwelling on the land. Supporting documents have also been tendered.  
     
      
       
      
    3 The Court will now determine the appropriate sentence.  
     
      
       
        
       
      
    The offence 
     
      
       
      
    4 The defendant is charged with the commission of an offence under s 125(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act in that, on a date or dates between 22 March 2006 and 30 May 2006, he carried out development on land at 23 Clyde Street, Guildford, New South Wales, being Lot 1 and 2 in Deposited Plan 734, without a development consent obtained and in force with respect to the development, and where consent was required to be obtained and in force for that development under the provisions of an environmental planning instrument which applied to the land.  
     
      
       
      
    The circumstances of the offence 
     
      
       
      
    5 The defendant is and was at all relevant times the registered proprietor of the land. The development comprised the excavation of an area approximately 9 metres wide, 15 metres long and about 3 to 4 metres deep, and construction and placement of precast concrete panels along the perimeter of the excavated area and the construction of a concrete slab on the base of the excavated area. The excavated area was located about one metre from the northern boundary of the land.  
     
      
       
      
    6 The defendant was present on the land with others and was the person in charge when the development was being carried out. The development carried out by the defendant required development consent pursuant to Holroyd Local Environmental Plan 1991, cl 9 and the zoning table thereto, with respect to Zone 2(a) (Residential A zone).  
     
      
       
      
    7 The defendant lodged a development application with the Council on 21 February 2006 for a detached, four bedroom dwelling house with two storeys. The development application did not seek approval for a basement area and, specifically, did not seek approval for the basement area and associated works that were subsequently carried out by the defendant. 
     
      
       
      
    8 The defendant commenced the excavation work some time after 22 March 2006. During the week of 15-22 March 2006, the Council’s senior building surveyor, Mr Steve Bedano, conducted an inspection of the land. Mr Bedano observed that the land was vacant, the ground was relatively flat and there were no excavation works on the land. At that time, the only improvement on the land was a freestanding garage. 
     
      
       
      
    9 The Council granted a development consent, number 2006/553, to the defendant on 6 April 2006. The development consent did not provide approval for the excavation or construction of a basement area.  
     
      
       
      
    10 The area which the defendant excavated, and in which he placed the concrete slab and panel walls, was physically located beneath the footprint of the dwelling which the Council had approved by way of the development consent.  
     
      
       
      
    11 The defendant carried out the excavation works, and the erection of the concrete slab and panel walls, to construct a basement for the dwelling house that he proposed to construct on the land.  
     
      
       
      
    The circumstances upon detection of the offence 
     
      
       
      
    12 On 23 May 2006, the Council’s assistant building surveyor, Mr Joshua Baker, attended the land, having been informed of the excavation on the land. Mr Baker saw the excavated basement area and the concrete slab floor and panel walls. Mr Baker was directed to the defendant as the person in charge by three other men present on the land. The defendant identified himself as the owner/builder. In regard to the commencement of the works, Mr Baker and the defendant had a conversation to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
       Mr Baker: “What is the excavation for?”  
        
       The defendant: “I was told that it would be cheaper to excavate the site and provide support for the house this way, than it would be to drill pier holes”. 
        
       Mr Baker: “I don’t agree with that”. 
        
       The defendant: “Look, I don’t know, I’m not a builder, I have just been told that it would be cheaper to do it this way”. 
        
       Mr Baker: 
         
        “Well, what is it you are doing?” 
        
       The defendant: “I am getting ready to pour the concrete tilt-up panels for the house that are required to support the house because the house is a tilt-up panel type of construction and I was told these tilt-up panels are needed to support the house”. 
       
      
    13 Mr Baker took photographs on 23 May 2006. Those photographs show the excavation and the tilt-up panels on each of the walls together with formwork where the concrete slab would be poured on the floor.  
     
      
       
      
    14 On 29 May 2006, the Council sent a letter consisting of a stop work notice to the defendant by a facsimile. The Council ordered the defendant to stop all works on the land, obtain a construction certificate, secure the land and shore excavated areas.  
     
      
       
      
    15 On the morning of 30 May 2006, Mr Baker conducted a further site inspection. Mr Baker observed that the land was fenced off and closed up. There were men present on the land working in the excavated area. Mr Baker heard banging sounds coming from within the excavated area and observed two men in the excavated area. Mr Baker saw some concrete panels had been stood in place to form four external walls above the concrete slab. He noticed a concrete slab inside the excavated section and bags of materials inside the confines of the concrete walls. Mr Baker also took photographs on 30 May 2006.  
     
      
       
      
    16 On the afternoon of 30 May 2006, the defendant attended the Council chambers and had a conversation with Mr Baker. Relevantly words to the following effect were spoken: 
     
      
       
       Mr Baker: “Why has construction continued on the site?” 
        
       The defendant: “As far as I knew it had stopped. Since you told me to stop work last week I got everyone to leave the site”. 
        
       Mr Baker: “So you didn’t continue with the pouring of concrete on that day?” 
        
       The defendant: “No, I rang the engineer and contractors to tell them to stop work until I sort out the construction certificate”. 
        
       Mr Baker: “Who engaged the workers to continue working?” 
        
       The defendant: “I didn’t. It must have been a misunderstanding between the engineers and concreters. I didn’t even know they had continued until today. My PCA said I could start construction. I’m not a builder you know. I’m new to all this. I don’t know what the process is”. 
        
       The defendant: “After you left the site last week I rang my certifier to ask where all the paperwork is and to try and sort this out. We just argued after I told him that the Council was involved. He didn’t want to know anything about it. We ended up hanging up on each other”. 
        
       Mr Baker: “Okay. So why have you excavated the site?” 
        
       The defendant: “My engineer told me it was required because the dwelling is constructed of concrete panels”. 
        
       Mr Baker: “I don’t see why you would be required to excavate in order to construct a two storey dwelling. The dwelling might well be constructed of concrete panels but why do you need to excavate?” 
        
       The defendant: “The house will have concrete panels and they need to be supported on panel...my engineer told me that piers would be a lot dearer than the excavation would be...see, these panels are to hold up the other panels” [referring to the engineering plans]. 
        
       Mr Baker: “I disagree as the plans indicate a ground floor construction not for a basement”.  
        
       The defendant: “It’s for the basement for the underneath, not the ground floor”. 
        
       
      
    17 On 31 May 2006, the Council’s solicitors sent a letter to the defendant, inclosing a proposed undertaking that the defendant not carry out any development activities on the land, cease all construction activities, that no construction activities be resumed until the construction certificate has been issued, and that written notification be provided to Council when a construction certificate has been obtained and before any further construction activities are carried out.  
     
      
       
      
    18 The defendant signed the proposed undertakings and provided them to the Council’s solicitor on 31 May 2006. The defendant has complied with his undertakings. 
     
      
       
      
    19 On 8 September 2006, the Council issued an emergency order on the defendant requiring works to be carried out to address the observed slumping of ground adjacent to the excavated area and to provide proper drainage for the excavated area. 
     
      
       
      
    20 The defendant and the Council officers have been working together with their engineers to stabilise the land. The works required pursuant to the emergency order described above have not been carried out by the time of the sentence hearing. However, the parties have agreed at the on site conference held on 14 February 2007 on a revised list of works to be carried out. The parties have advised that the works will shortly be undertaken.  
     
      
       
      
    Objective gravity of the offence 
     
      
       
      
    Maximum penalty 
     
      
       
      
    21 The maximum penalty for the commission of an offence against s 125(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act is $1,100,000. Such a large penalty reflects the public expression by the parliament of the seriousness of offences of this kind. However, the range of matters to which this maximum penalty applies is large. The penalty applies to offences which range from the domestic to the commercial, from the minor to the extensive.  
     
      
       
      
    Objective harmfulness of the offence 
     
      
       
      
    22 The commission of the offence involved the unlawful excavation of an area wholly located beneath the approved footprint of the dwelling house. In that sense, the commission of the offence would never have caused any significant harm in terms of visual impact or other associated amenity impacts on the defendant’s neighbours.  
     
      
       
      
    23 The defendant’s actions were also carried out during daylight working hours. They were easily able to be observed, including by a passing Council officer. At the time of commission of the offence and continuing to date, there have been no complaints by neighbours as to what took place and there have been no amenity impacts. The area surrounding the land is flat. Once the infill of the excavated area and surrounds has been completed (which will be done shortly), the physical appearance of the area will be as it was prior to the excavation commencing and with no resultant harm to the environment or the streetscape.  
     
      
       
      
    24 Further, there is no evidence before the Court to suggest that had the basement been completed as intended by the defendant, the integrity of the two storey house above it, once constructed, would have been in any way compromised.  
     
      
       
      
    25 Accordingly, the objective harmfulness of the offence is low.  
     
      
       
      
    State of mind and reasons for commission of the offence 
     
      
       
      
    26 The defendant gave oral evidence that after he submitted the development application to the Council he formed the idea that it would be beneficial to have an additional area, in a basement, for storage and use by the family. He believed this could be done whilst work was being done to construct the approved dwelling house. Because of his work background in pre-cast concrete panels, he determined to use such panels around the walls of the basement.  
     
      
       
      
    27 The defendant knew that there was a need to lodge a development application for the construction of the dwelling house and indeed he had lodged one. Accordingly, the defendant must have known that development consent would have been required for the excavation and construction of the basement. The defendant could have amended the development application that he had lodged with the Council to incorporate his new idea of the basement underneath the dwelling house. Yet he chose not to do so. There was, therefore, premeditation in the construction of the basement and the avoidance of obtaining development consent for it.  
     
      
       
      
    28 The defendant’s knowledge of the wrongfulness of his conduct at the time is also shown by his untruthful answers to the Council officers in the conversations that I have earlier set out when the defendant was asked the reason for excavation of the basement. The defendant knew that his conduct in constructing the basement was wrongful and he sought to evade responsibility by giving untruthful answers.  
     
      
       
      
    29 The premeditation of the commission of the offence with knowledge of its unlawfulness aggravates the seriousness of the offence and the culpability of the defendant.  
     
      
       
      
    Subjective circumstances of the offenderPlea of guilty 
     
      
       
      
    30 The defendant has pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity at the first mention of these proceedings in the Court on 2 February 2007. He should receive the maximum discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty to the criminal justice system.  
     
      
       
      
    Contrition and remorse31 Although the defendant upon being confronted with his wrongdoing was untruthful and avoided responsibility for his actions, subsequently he had a change of attitude.  
     
      
       
      
    32 The defendant complied with the Council’s stop work notice. He gave a written undertaking not to carry out any development activities on the land, to cease all construction activities, to not resume construction activities until the construction certificate had been issued and to provide written notification to the Council when a construction certificate had been issued and before any further construction activities were carried out. The defendant has complied with these undertakings. The defendant will shortly comply with the emergency order that the Council issued to the defendant to carry out works to address the observed slumping of the ground adjacent to the excavated area and to provide proper drainage for the excavated area.  
     
      
       
      
    33 The defendant has worked with officers of the Council to stabilise the land and the defendant will shortly carry out works to effectively reinstate the land and hence remedy the breach of the Act.  
     
      
       
      
    34 The defendant has expressed contrition and remorse independently of his plea of guilty. Prior to the prosecutor commencing proceedings in this Court, the prosecutor’s solicitor had indicated in correspondence with the defendant’s solicitor that it was likely proceedings would be commenced against the defendant. In response, the defendant’s solicitor indicated that if proceedings were commenced, they would not be contested. In the same correspondence the defendant, through his solicitor, agreed unconditionally to fill in the excavated area the subject of the charge. On the day the summons commencing these proceedings was made returnable in the Court, namely 2 February 2007, the defendant’s solicitor indicated a plea of guilty would be entered. These actions manifest the defendant’s contrition and remorse.  
     
      
       
      
    35 The defendant has given sworn testimony in this sentence hearing. In that evidence, he frankly and sincerely acknowledged that his actions both in carrying out the offence and in his initial responses to the Council officers were wrong. He has apologised for his conduct. He has promised not to ever reoffend.  
     
      
       
      
    36 These actions of the defendant in stopping work, making reparation, accepting responsibility and confessing his guilt all establish genuine contrition and remorse. This contrition and remorse should be taken into account over and above the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.  
     
      
       
      
    Assistance to authorities 
     
      
       
      
    37 As I have summarised above, the defendant has, after the initial evasiveness, co-operated with the Council. In addition, in the preparation of these proceedings the defendant has agreed to a statement of facts and has offered to pay the prosecutor’s costs as agreed or assessed.  
     
      
       
      
    No prior record38 The defendant has no prior criminal record. 
     
      
       
      
    Prior good character 
     
      
       
      
    39 Apart from having no prior criminal record, the defendant also has prior good character. The defendant gave sworn oral evidence of his personal history including his arrival in Australia, his learning English and completing his Higher School Certificate, being a prefect in his final year of school, studying and successfully completing a Diploma of Building Science at TAFE, his work experience, his marriage and children and his caring for his sick father. Character references have been tendered, one from an immediate neighbour of the land the subject of the offence, and two from family friends. The references speak to the defendant being a hardworking individual who is dedicated to his family, has cared for his parents and has supported his church community. They speak to the defendant being a trustworthy, honest and hardworking person.  
     
      
       
      
    40 The weight of these references is diminished somewhat by them not being addressed to the Court and not showing that the deponents were aware of the offence or its circumstances. They are also unsworn. Nevertheless, they corroborate a view that I have formed independently from the defendant’s sworn testimony at the sentence hearing.  
     
      
       
      
    Unlikely to reoffend 
     
      
       
         
       
      
    41 The defendant has suffered financially and personally from the experience of committing the offence. Financially, the defendant has given evidence that he has spent approximately $86,000 in excavating and constructing the basement to the point where work ceased. Subsequently, the defendant has spent a further approximately $81,000 in carrying out the various works required by the Council and in discharge of the undertakings the defendant gave to the Council. The defendant has given evidence that he will need to spend a further approximately $18,000 in reinstating the land, including filling the basement, to the state the land was in before carrying out the works. Finally, the defendant gave evidence that he has incurred approximately $14,000 in interest charges in the period from stopping work in May 2006 to date. These interest charges would not have been incurred had the defendant not carried out the illegal excavation and construction of the basement. Cumulatively, the defendant has therefore incurred over $200,000 as a result of committing the offence. This is a considerable financial impost and certainly has shown, as the defendant has readily acknowledged, that crime does not pay.  
     
      
       
      
    42 The defendant has also suffered personally. The defendant gave evidence of the considerable stress that has been imposed on himself, his wife and his family, and his father. The defendant tendered a medical certificate which showed that he is suffering depression and anxiety. The defendant also spoke of the stress that has been caused in his relationship with his wife. The defendant also said that his father has suffered as a result of the offence and subsequent prosecution.  
     
      
       
      
    43 The defendant frankly acknowledged that by all of these factors he has learnt his lesson and would not reoffend in the future. I consider that the defendant is unlikely to reoffend in the future. I also consider that the defendant has excellent prospects of rehabilitation due to his age, work, family circumstances and prior good character and the extent to which he has expressed contrition and remorse.  
     
      
       
      
    Financial means of defendant 
     
      
       
      
    44 The defendant has provided information from various financial returns to show that his income has been modest. He gave evidence that in order to fund the various expenses which will now be thrown away (that I have set out above), he has had to sell the property at which he and his family have resided at 2 Vulcan Street, Guildford. The defendant is now living with his family in rented premises. I take into account the means of the defendant in fixing the amount of the fine. 
     
      
       
      
    Synthesis of objective and subjective circumstances 
     
      
       
      
    45 Taking all of these objective and subjective circumstances into account, I consider the appropriate penalty for the commission of the offence is a fine. I consider that the appropriate amount of the fine, prior to taking into account the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, is $15,000. After discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty of 25%, this gives a fine of $11,250. 
     
      
       
      
    Orders 
     
      
       
      
    46 The Court makes the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
       1. The defendant is convicted of the offence as charged. 
        
        
       2. The defendant is fined $11,250. 
        
        
       3. The defendant is to pay the prosecutor’s legal costs of the proceedings as agreed or assessed.

      EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: These three prosecutions alleging water pollution in Sydney Harbour are brought against the owner, master and chief engineer of a ship. The defendants object to the tender by the prosecution of two expert reports by a Mr Trevor Cosh which are annexed to the expert report of Peter Burge of January 2006, which in turn is annexed to Mr Burge’s affidavit of 31 January 2006 read in the prosecution’s case. 
     
      
    2 The prosecutor seeks to tender the two Cosh reports on the basis that they are admissible as business records under s 69 of the Evidence Act. They were obtained by the prosecution from documents which the prosecution subpoenaed from the owner of the vessel.3 The defendants variously submitted as follows.4 First, it was submitted that the documents were not business records within s 69 of the Evidence Act. This submission was made on behalf of the owner and the master but not the chief engineer.5 Secondly, it was submitted that Mr Cosh has not undertaken to be bound by the expert witness code of conduct as required by the old rules of the Supreme Court of New South Wales which are incorporated into the rules of this Court in proceedings of this type.6 Thirdly, it was said that Mr Burge agreed with some of the opinions expressed by Mr Cosh, which made it the equivalent of a joint report where only one of the persons making the joint report is called to give evidence and the other is not.7 Fourthly, it was submitted on behalf of the chief engineer that the opinions expressed by Mr Cosh are not admissible under s 69 because they contravene the opinion rule in s 76. It was pointed out that s 69 only provides that business records are exceptions to the hearsay rule. 8 Finally, it was submitted that if Cosh reports are otherwise admissible then they should be precluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act.9 I propose to proceed directly to the s 137 issue and will, for the purposes of dealing with that issue, assume, without deciding, that the reports are otherwise admissible.10 Section 137 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. 
        
       
      
    11 Section 137 may be contrasted with s 135(a) which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
         
        (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party. 
        
       
      
    12 Two points of distinction between ss 137 and 135(a) may be noted. First, under s 137 it is mandatory for the court to refuse to admit the evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. Secondly, the test under s 137 is simply “outweighed”, whereas under s 135 the test is “substantially outweighed”.  
     
      
    13 The defendants submitted, and I accept, that matters bearing on the probative value of the Cosh reports include that it is not on oath; there is no undertaking by Mr Cosh to be bound by the expert witness code of conduct; it contains a lot of hearsay information; and in the second report Mr Cosh said that his first report should be disregarded. 14 The prosecutor submitted, and I accept, that it is also relevant to probative value that the first Cosh report recorded that Mr Cosh did on some six occasions between 22 October and 15 November 2002 attend the subject vessel. The incident the subject of these proceedings occurred during that period and that there were in attendance a number of employees of the owner including the chief engineer.15 The defendants submitted, essentially, that there is unfair prejudice because Mr Cosh is not available for cross-examination. I have been taken to a number of aspects of the Cosh report which satisfy me that in the normal course the defendants would wish to cross-examine Mr Cosh. I conclude that there is a substantial danger that the defendants will be unfairly prejudiced if denied that opportunity.16 In Galvin v R (2006) 161 A Crim R 449, Howie J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed, said at [40]: 
     
      
       
        
        The fact that the defence could not cross-examine MW was an important consideration but not necessarily a decisive one. However, as was pointed out in  
        R v Suteski 
         (2002) 56 NSWLR 82 at [127], each case has to be determined on its own particular facts depending upon the probative value of the evidence and its prejudicial effect.  
        Suteski 
         was a very different case to the present. In the present case the fact that the defence could not cross-examine MW might have had more significance when considering some part of his evidence than it would when considering some other part of it... 
        
       
      
    17 The prosecutor did not so much argue that there was no prejudice but, rather, argued that the prejudice was not unfair because of, or could be ameliorated through, the request provisions of the Evidence Act to be found in s 167 read with s 166. Section 167 permitted the defendants to make a reasonable request to the prosecutor to call Mr Cosh as a witness. It was said by the prosecutor that the affidavit of Mr Burge to which the Cosh reports are annexed was sworn in January 2006 and was served about a year ago, and therefore the defendants have been aware of the prosecution’s intention to tender the Cosh reports and could have made such a request. It was also suggested by the prosecutor that there being a question as to whether these proceedings will finish in the time allotted to them, that a direction could be made that the defendants request that he be made available. 
     
      
    18 I respectfully agree with the observations made in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [38] that the balancing exercise under s 137 is more accurately described as the exercise of “judgment” than “discretion.” In Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at [93], McHugh J referred to some then recent decisions which suggested that the term “unfair prejudice” may have a broader meaning than that suggested by the Australian Law Reform Commission and that it may cover procedural disadvantages which a party may suffer as a result of admitting evidence under the provisions of the Evidence Act. His Honour concluded that it was unnecessary to express a concluded opinion on the correctness of those decisions, although he was inclined to think that the learned judges in those cases had been too much influenced by the common law attitude to hearsay evidence, had not given sufficient weight to the change that the Act had brought about in making hearsay evidence admissible to prove facts in issue, and had not given sufficient weight to the traditional meaning of “prejudice” in a context of rejecting evidence for discretionary reasons. 
     
      
    19 In Ringrow Pty Limited v BP Australia Limited [2003] FCA 933, an issue arose as to the admissibility of a valuer’s report containing expert opinion where the maker of the opinion was not called to give evidence and the valuation was tendered as a business record under s 69 of the Evidence Act. Hely J held that s 69 was to be construed broadly and that the report could be regarded as a business record. However, his Honour rejected the tender under s 135. A factor which strongly influenced his Honour, after noting that the probative value of the reports in that case was slight, was the inability to cross-examine. 20 In my opinion, having regard to the various factors to which I have referred, the probative value of the Cosh reports is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendants. Accordingly, pursuant to s 137, I refuse to admit the Cosh reports.

      CAMPBELLTOWN CITY COUNCIL v JOHN MHANNA 
       
       
       
      EX TEMPORE JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The defendant, John Mhanna, pleads guilty to the charge that between late April 2008 and about 8 May 2008, at Macquarie Fields in the State of New South Wales, he committed an offence against s 125(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 in that he did the following thing which was forbidden to be done by s 81A(2) of that Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “He did commence the erection of buildings in accordance with a development consent when a construction certificate for the building work had not been issued by the consent authority or an accredited certifier”. 
        
       
      
    AGREED FACTS2 The defendant committed the offence by authorising the following works to be carried out which constituted the commencement of the erection of buildings without a construction certificate: 
     
      
       
      a) excavation for laying of concrete slabs; 
       
      b) in relation to two concrete slabs, the construction of formwork and the laying of those slabs; 
       
      c) additional works comprising formwork and steel in preparation for the pouring of additional slabs (which were not in fact poured); and 
       
      d) the emplacement of drainage lines and pipes. 
       
      
    3 At the time these works were carried out the defendant was a building project supervisor. 
     
      
    4 These works were carried out on land comprising Lots 8 and 9 in DP 233072 and Lot 2 in DP 520114, known as 16-20 Myee Road, Macquarie Fields (the Land).5 On 11 May 2006 the Prosecutor had granted development consent No. 2340/2005/DA-M for the demolition of the three existing dwellings on the Land and the construction of 15 town-house dwellings and strata sub-division on the Land. 6 It was a term of the development consent that it would lapse unless the development was commenced within two years from the endorsed date or as otherwise provided under s 95 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act.7 Westcity Development Pty Ltd (Westcity) and its director, Ms Tina He, were the owners of the Land.8 Prior to the commission of the offence, the defendant had entered into an informal arrangement with Westcity, pursuant to which the defendant was to carry out works on behalf of a corporation, Icewick Pty Ltd (Icewick), in pursuance of the townhouse development approved by the development consent.9 In about late April 2008, the defendant authorised works to commence on the Land.10 On or around 8 May 2008, the defendant authorised and arranged for concrete slabs to be poured on the Land.11 During the period from late April 2008 to about 8 May 2008, the defendant authorised the other works particularised in [2] above.12 At the time the defendant authorised the carrying out of these works, he was aware that a construction certificate was required to carry out those works and he was aware that a construction certificate had not been obtained. When interviewed by council officers later, on 23 June 2008, the defendant stated that, at the time he had authorised the carrying out of these works, he had been informed by the private certifier that a construction certificate was imminent.13 The defendant made a decision to authorise the carrying out of the building works without a construction certificate because of the need, of which he was aware, to physically commence the development the subject of the development consent within two years of the date of its issue, namely by 11 May 2008, to avoid the consent lapsing on its terms.14 On 29 May 2008 Mr David Day, an officer of Campbelltown City Council (the prosecutor), inspected the Land in response to information he received. Prior to inspecting the Land, Mr Day reviewed files held by the prosecutor in relation to the Land and had seen the development applications and consents in relation to the Land.15 Upon arriving at the Land, Mr Day observed that there were three dwellings, located at 16, 18 and 20 Myee Road. He observed timber framework located upon the footpath nature strip adjacent to 2 Myee Road. The customer name on the docket attached to the framework was John Mhanna. He walked down the driveway between 16 and 18 Myee Road which had been modified for the purpose of forming a construction driveway.16 Mr Day observed construction works in progress at the rear of the dwellings situated on the Land. He saw that two concrete slabs had been formed and poured which were in the approximate location where some of the townhouses the subject of the development consent were to be constructed according to the approved plans.17 Mr Day also observed additional works comprising formwork and steel for the formwork and slab preparation of certain other of the townhouses the subject of the development consent.18 Mr Day observed that there was no construction signage identifying the owner or principal certifying authority, or the builder or any names or contact numbers. While inspecting the Land on 29 May 2009, Mr Day took a number of photographs.19 After inspecting the Land, Mr Day phoned Ms Tina He, who had been nominated as the owner of the Land on the development application form. Ms He informed Mr Day that Mr Mhanna was responsible for the construction works and obtaining the necessary approvals. Ms He gave Mr Day Mr Mhanna’s mobile phone number.20 That same afternoon (29 May 2009) Mr Day phoned Mr Mhanna on his mobile phone and, after introductions, they had the following conversation: 
     
      
       
      Mr Day: “I have carried out an inspection of 16-20 Myee Road, 
       
        
         
          
           
            
            Macquarie Fields, and I believe that the works have commenced without the prior approvals”. 
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      Mr Mhanna: “I am the builder on site. I know I do not have a construction certificate authorising the commencement of works. It is council’s fault that I started the works without a CC, because you would not give me an extension of time on the development application”. 
       
      Mr Day: “You will need to come in to council for a formal interview to discuss the site works which have commenced.” 
       
      Mr Mhanna: “I will need to speak to my lawyer.” 
       
      
    21 On 2 June 2008 Mr Day prepared and issued to the owners of the Land and Icewick Pty Ltd: 
     
      
       
      (a) an emergency order No 21 under section 124 of the  
      Local Government Act  
      1993 
        
      (Ref: 138/2008/N-LGA); and 
       
       
      (b) an emergency order pursuant to section 121B of the  
      Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 
      . 
       
      
    22 On 10 June 2008 Mr Day again attended the Land for the purposes of ascertaining whether the orders he had issued had been complied with. He observed that no further works had been carried out on the site. 
     
      
    23 On 23 June 2008, the defendant was interviewed by Mr Day and his colleague, Mr Paul Curley, at the prosecutor’s chambers. During the interview, the defendant said he was the developer of the site and the principal of the corporation Icewick which was nominated as the builder for the purpose of the proposed development on the Land. The defendant admitted that he had authorised the construction works to commence and had arranged for the pouring of the slabs. He again admitted he was aware a construction certificate had not been obtained prior to the commencement of the works and said he was informed it was imminent by a private certifier, Mr Tony Qui. 
     
      
    24 That second emergency order required the defendant to immediately cease all construction, excavation and building works. There is no suggestion that he did not comply with that order.DEFENDANT’S EVIDENCE25 The defendant gave unchallenged evidence to the following effect. At the time of the matters, the subject of the charge against him, he was a construction supervisor for Icewick Pty Ltd and has since become a director. In about April 2008 Icewick was approached by Westcity to carry out building works on its land. Westcity was controlled by Ms Tina He. Neither the defendant nor Icewick have ever had any interest in Westcity nor in the subject property other than as a provider of building services in the case of Icewick and as a source of wages in the case of the defendant. 
     
      
    26 Neither the defendant nor Icewick was a developer with respect to the works at the property in the sense of being financially interested in the final outcome of the project. There may have been an erroneous impression gained at one point by the council that the defendant was the developer. In fact, at all times, the developer was Westcity. 27 He learned from Ms He that Westcity had obtained a development consent to demolish three existing cottages on the property and erect fifteen townhouses. He understood from Ms He that she was under considerable financial stress in not being able to get construction under way. In particular, there was a problem, according to Ms He, about satisfying one of the development conditions concerning the grant of an easement because of the slow response by the council to submissions and correspondence on the subject. The defendant understood the problem was becoming critical because the development consent was shortly to lapse.28 As at the beginning of May 2008 the only other significant matter which had to be attended to before commencement of works on the property was the issue of a construction certificate. The defendant approached a private construction certifier, Mr Tony Qui, and ascertained that a construction certificate could issue immediately once the easement issue was sorted out with the council.29 At the time, in April or May 2008, the defendant was very sympathetic to the plight in which Westcity and Ms He found themselves. To his mind the council was being deliberately unreasonable and slow in dealing with the easement issue so as to bring about a lapsing of the development consent. The defendant says that he ""foolishly"" suggested a course of action to Ms He that Icewick arrange to construct the foundations so it could be said there had been substantial commencement of the works and thus save the development consent from lapsing.30 It was his understanding at that time that this practice was widely used in the building industry to save development consents from lapsing. He says that since the commencement of these proceedings he has obtained legal advice and accepts that his understanding was erroneous in point of law.31 He says he is very sorry about this lapse on his part and gives an assurance to the Court that he will not counsel or allow this to happen again in respect of any project with which he has any connection. 32 Ms He accepted his suggestion and went ahead and arranged with contractors for Icewick to install two foundation slabs in the rear yard of the existing dwellings. This occurred in early May 2008 and before 11 May 2008.33 The existing dwellings were not disturbed and are still in place. There is no impact on the amenity of the neighbour nor any adverse visual impact. The slabs are not visible from the street. By the time the council objected to the works the building activity at the site had ceased pending the issue of a construction certificate. Neither the defendant nor Icewick have received any payment for the works carried out on the site. The defendant would be quite prepared to remediate the site. This could be most satisfactorily done with little disturbance to the neighbourhood by recovering the slab areas with natural fill and re-grassing if the council so permits.34 The defendant is fifty eight years of age. He migrated to Australia from Egypt in 1977 and since then has worked in the engineering and construction industries. He has no prior convictions for environmental or planning offences. He lives with his wife in his son's home. His wife is employed but is not involved in the affairs of Icewick. 35 At the present time he has very limited financial resources of his own. He is mainly dependent on his wife for living expenses. He is working from time to time on a casual basis on building consulting work. He has applied for financial assistance from Centrelink and is waiting for his application to be processed. His health is poor. He suffers from anxiety, hypertension and stress. He believes he does not have any immediate or long term full time employment prospects. He says he has no realistic prospects of paying any substantial penalty from his own resources and would need to rely on his wife and son to assist him. 36 He says he realises that what he has done is stupid and he apologises for it. He says he is deeply distressed and anxious about the trouble which has been caused. He cannot concentrate and has difficulty in sleeping at night because he is so worried about the matter. He says he had good intentions at the time but accepts that he was completely wrong to arrange for the works to go ahead in any way regardless of any hardship to the owner and any view he may have taken about the conduct of the council.37 After taking legal advice after the commencement of these proceedings, he says he quickly realised his error and indicated that he would plead guilty. He agrees to pay the legal costs of the council.38 I generally accept the defendant's evidence, subject to one qualification. His evidence that he understood that the practice of arranging for foundations to be constructed was widely used in the building industry to save development consents from lapsing, does not specifically address the circumstance that, in this case, no construction certificate had been issued, and his own understanding was that a construction certificate was required before the work should have commenced. CHARACTER39 Two references have been tendered in the defendant's case. One is by a parish priest who has known the defendant and his family for over seventeen years. It establishes that the defendant is a person of good character. The other is by a medical practitioner who has known the defendant as a patient for some three years.

    SENTENCING LEGISLATION40 The purposes of sentencing are set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        3A Purposes of sentencing 
         
         
        The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows: 
         
         
        (a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
         
        (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
         
        (c) to protect the community from the offender, 
         
        (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
         
        (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
         
        (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
         
        (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.” 
        
       
      
    41 Each of the sub-paragraphs of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is applicable to varying and limited degrees, bearing in mind that the subject offence is one of strict liability and of a regulatory nature, and that concepts such as harm to victims and rehabilitation of the offender need to be understood in that context. 
     
      
    SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS42 The Court is required to take into account the aggravating, mitigating and other factors referred to in ss 21A and 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, although they are not exhaustive of the matters which the Court must take into account. None of the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A apply in the present case.43 The objective circumstances of the offence to which the Court must have regard include the maximum penalty, the need for general deterrence, the defendant's state of mind in committing the offence, and the reasons for committing the offence. MAXIMUM PENALTY44 The maximum penalty at the time of the offence was $33,000. It was increased to $110,000 as from August 2008, but there is no submission that I should take the increase into account. The maximum penalty stands in sharp contrast to the maximum penalty generally of $1.1 million for offences against the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act at the time of this offence: s 126. The maximum penalty for an offence reflects the public expression by parliament of the seriousness of the offence. Relatively speaking, this offence was and is regarded by parliament as much less serious than offences generally under the Act.  
     
      
    PLACE OF THE OFFENCE IN THE PLANNING REGIME45 The commencement of the erection of a building without a construction certificate tends to undermine one of the listed objects of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act, namely, the object of encouraging the promotion and co-ordination of the orderly and economic use and development of land. The provisions for obtaining construction certificates are part of the approval process and play an important role in the regulatory regime under the Act.46 The principal approval for the carrying out of development under the Act is a development consent, relevantly under Part 4 of the Act, which, in this case, had been obtained. The carrying out of works without a development consent (not this case) is objectively more serious than the carrying out of works without a construction certificate (this case), because the former offence undermines the approval system in a more material manner than the latter, by subverting the proper assessment of the proposed development and by prejudicing the opportunity for the public participation afforded at that stage of the approval process as contemplated under the Act.47 The construction certificate is a secondary phase of approval. By this stage, the primary assessment of the appropriateness of the development has already been undertaken. Nevertheless, the obtaining of a construction certificate is a necessary and important pre-requisite to the commencement of building works to ensure the integrity of the construction works, the prior notification of the works to the consent authority and the putting into train of a proper mechanism for the overseeing and certification of the building works by suitably qualified, independent and accredited persons.DETERRENCE48 There is a need for general deterrence in order to maintain the integrity of the construction certificate system, particularly given the council's loss of control when private certifiers are used: Canterbury City Council v Daoud [2007] NSWLEC 135 at [45]. One of the purposes of the amendments which replaced the previous building approval regime with the current regime for the granting of construction certificates under part 4A of the Act, including by accredited persons practising in the private sector, was to avoid the need for the resources of local government to be taken up in approval and supervision of development after issuing of development consent. If, as here, a local council is not appointed as the entity responsible for issuing the construction certificate, the council will generally not be in a position to know whether a developer is complying with the post development consent requirements, and, in particular, the requirement to defer commencement of building works until a construction certificate is issued. Consequently, offences of this nature may be difficult to detect and the system relies upon its observance by developers and builders and those involved in the construction process. This suggests that there is a need for sentences to serve as effective general deterrents, provided that no single offender has to shoulder an unfair burden in the attainment of the objective of general deterrence.49 The prosecutor submits that there is a need for specific deterrence, as the defendant carries out works in the building industry and will continue to experience the temptation, which all developers face in this industry, to short-cut the regulatory requirements, or not properly advert to them, where proper advertence, and compliance with those requirements would occasion financial detriment, commercial disadvantage or inconvenience. However, in my view, the defendant is genuinely contrite and unlikely to re-offend.STATE OF MIND50 When the defendant commenced the erection of the buildings on the Land, he knew that a construction certificate was required and was aware that one had not been obtained. The development was required to be commenced within two years of the issuing of the development consent (ie before 11 May 2008). The defendant was obviously concerned that the development consent would lapse if physical works did not commence on the site and, in contravening s 81A(2) of the Act, he was motivated by his desire to secure the advantage for Westcity and, to the extent that it would thereby secure the work for himself, for his own advantage.OBJECTIVE HARMFULNESS51 As regards the objective harmfulness of the defendant's actions, there is no suggestion that he carried out work other than in accordance with the approved plans. This is not a case where the absence of a construction certificate went hand in hand with divergence from the approved development. In some respects the case is comparable with Canterbury City Council v Daoud, although in that case the defendant believed that a construction certificate had issued. That belief, however, was not accepted by the Court as entirely reasonable.MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES52 The defendant submits that there are a number of mitigating circumstances: 
     
      
       
      (a) the defendant was not a principal in a financial or ownership sense; 
       
      (b) this is more a case of misguided zeal in assisting a client in difficulty. The client was under financial stress, and about to have a development consent lapse. Difficulty and delay was being experienced in finalising an easement which was apparently all that prevented the issue of a construction certificate; 
       
      (c) the defendant believed the issue of a construction certificate was imminent; 
       
      (d) the defendant stood to gain little or nothing by his actions nor did he do so; 
       
      (e) the defendant is contrite and has apologised; 
       
      (f) the defendant accepts full personal responsibility for his actions; 
       
      (g) the works were carried out over a very short period and are minimal in extent and otherwise in accordance with the development consent. There is no adverse visual impact or adverse impact on the amenity or the neighbourhood; 
       
      (h) the defendant is prepared to make amends by remediating the site subject to the approval of the owner and the council; 
       
      (i) the defendant is fifty eight years of age and has a number of health issues; 
       
      (j) the defendant's financial circumstances are poor and his future employment prospects are poor; 
       
      (k) any financial penalty imposed on the defendant will be extremely onerous; 
       
      (l) the defendant is otherwise of good character and unlikely to offend again; 
       
      (m) the defendant quickly entered a guilty plea upon obtaining legal advice; 
       
      (n) the defendant cooperated which council; and 
       
      (o) the defendant is willing to pay the reasonable legal expenses of the prosecution. 
       
      
    53 I generally accept the defendant's submissions on mitigation subject to a qualification concerning the proposition that he stood to gain little or nothing by his actions. I think that the defendant stood to gain income from the development if it were to proceed and that income was jeopardised if the development consent lapsed. 
     
      
    54 As regards the defendant's financial circumstances, I note his unchallenged evidence, which I have accepted, at [35] that he has very limited financial resources; he is mainly dependent on his wife for living expenses; he works from time to time on a casual basis on building consulting work; he has applied for financial assistance from Centrelink and is waiting for his application to be processed; and he has no realistic prospects of paying any substantial penalty from his own resources and would need to rely on his wife and son to assist him.55 The defendant has no prior convictions for planning or environmental offences. He is of good character. He has pleaded guilty, not at the first available opportunity, but promptly after he had obtained legal advice. It is common ground that the utilitarian value of the plea was not much diminished by that delay. I assess the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty as being reflected in a discount of twenty per cent on sentence: R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383 at [154], [160]. He has shown contrition and remorse. He has cooperated with the council to the extent of preparation of a statement of agreed facts. He has agreed to pay the prosecutor's costs. CONSISTENCY IN SENTENCING56 The prosecutor submits that there is no pattern of sentencing available for this category of offence, save that, to date, the small number of offences of this type have attracted relatively low penalties. In Canterbury City Council v Daoud a fine of $5,000 was imposed. Ku-Ring-Gai Council v Vinci [2007] NSWLEC 283 involved demolition of a heritage structure and a fine of $24,000 was imposed. In Willoughby City Council v P & V Masonry Pty Ltd [2003] NSWLEC 312 a $5,000 fine was imposed.SECTION 1057 The defendant submits that this is an appropriate case to apply the provisions of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and order the discharge of the defendant, conditional upon entering into a good behaviour bond, because of the mitigating factors. I do not consider it appropriate to take that course, particularly as the defendant knew that a construction certificate was required and had not been obtained.AMOUNT OF FINE58 The factor which to my mind should lead the court to impose a fine which is substantially less than otherwise would be imposed is the poor financial circumstances of the defendant. Synthesising the objective and subjective circumstances, including the discount to which I have referred for the early plea of guilty, I consider that an appropriate fine should be in the sum of $3,000. As indicated earlier, the fine would have been very much greater had it not been for the defendant's poor financial circumstances.ORDERS59 The orders of the Court are as follows: 
     
      
      (1) The defendant is convicted of the offence as charged; 
       
      (2) The defendant is fined the sum of $3,000;  
       
      (3) The defendant is to pay the prosecutor's costs of the proceedings.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Welda Bacolod appears for sentence today on nine separate matters. Seven of those were embezzlement as a clerical servant for which the maximum penalty is ten years imprisonment, and two are obtaining money by deception for which the maximum penalty is five years imprisonment. The offences were committed in a remarkably simple way, but that did not stop the offences being very serious indeed, involving lengthy criminality and a significant amount of money. The offender worked for the Swiss Hotel. She was involved in functions. It was her job to obtain and organise functions at the hotel. Of course, people that had functions at the hotel had to pay for them. All Ms Bacolod did was arrange for many functions to be paid for in cash and she would pocket the cash. She had to make some fraudulent entries in the books of account in order to cover up what she had done, but eventually when a reconciliation was done, it was discovered that she had been committing these offences over a significant period of time. In fact, the offences occurred over seven years and the total amount of money involved was 1.7 million dollars. The offence of embezzlement which covers the year 2006, offence six on the fact sheet tendered before me, involves almost a million dollars.2 Where did the money go? Well, the evidence suggests that the great bulk of the money went overseas. The evidence was that although the offender may have spent some relatively small amounts of the embezzled money on herself and her family in Australia, the great bulk of it went to her family overseas, primarily in the Philippines. When police investigated this matter, they found some photographs on the offender’s computer. One of those pictured a rather palatial home in a Philippine village. That home, it seems, was paid for by the appellant’s crimes and it is a home in which her children and her family live. It may well be that although the offender’s father is the registered proprietor, the appellant has some financial interest in the home. In any case, it was conceded on behalf of the offender that these offences were not committed out of need but simply greed. It seems that the offender took the opportunity which presented itself to steal money so that she could be generous towards her family. It enabled her parents to build the palatial home in the Philippines and it enabled other members of the family to have things they would not otherwise be able to have. The offender’s conduct certainly had the effect of sending the money out of the jurisdiction where it if difficult, if not impossible for it to be recovered. However, I am satisfied that at least some of the money could be recovered if the offender was to ask her parents, to live in less palatial accommodation for example. No genuine efforts have been made to repay any of the money at all. Of course, repayment would involve hardship but it would be a matter on which the offender would be entitled to rely, if she was prepared to ask her family both in Australia and elsewhere to undergo that hardship in order that she could, to some extent, right the wrong that she had done.3 The offender is a married woman with four children. They are 17,15, 14 and 12 months of age. She was born and raised in the Philippines where she met her husband with whom she migrated to Australia in 1991. She comes from what was described as a middle class family in the Philippines and described a loving and supportive childhood. When the Probation and Parole Service contacted her sister in the Philippines she was described as a generous person with high moral standards. Two things need to be said, she does not have high moral standards at all, and her generosity only came about because of her criminal activities. At the time of the offences the offender worked, so did her husband. They have recently purchased a cleaning franchise. Her three older children go to Catholic schools which are fee paying. She does have a mortgage, but the evidence certainly established a matter conceded by the offender, namely, there was no significant financial hardship which led to this offence being committed. There was no suggestion of any gambling being involved, any drug use or anything of that kind. This was simply a case where the offender saw an opportunity to take money, and substantial sums at that, which did not belong to her and took it.4 The offender has no prior criminal history. Prior good character is often of considerable importance when determining an appropriate sentence, but in this case it is of less importance where there are multiple offences extending over a lengthy period of time. It goes without saying that by the time she committed the last of the series of offences in 2007, she did not have prior good character at all. Also relevant to her assessment of her character is her explanation as to why it was that she committed these offences. Her answer was simply that she was tempted because no one was checking. The reason that no one was checking was that she was trusted by her employer. It is a significant factor that these offences all involve a breach of trust, although it has to be, of course, acknowledged immediately that a breach of trust is inherent in almost every case of embezzlement as a clerk. But offences such as these are serious because of the breach of trust which is involved, whether relevant as an element of the offence or not. For this reason, there needs to be a substantial component of general deterrence in any sentence imposed for these matters. 5 The offender pleaded guilty at an early stage and so I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by about twenty-five per cent to reflect that circumstance. She also cooperated with police and her employer’s accountants in identifying her criminality, that being from an early stage as well. She did make initial attempts to cover up what she had done by fraudulently altering some cheques, but once that was discovered, she seems to have been open with the police and the accountants in admitting what she had done. Her cooperation certainly meant that proving this matter was a lot easier than would have been the case if the matter had gone to trial, so the plea of guilty and the early cooperation did have a substantially utilitarian benefit which I have reflected in the discount I have earlier announced. 6 Much has been made of the offender’s relationship with her baby who is, as I have said, only 12 months of age. He is still breastfed, although not to the extent that she is unable to leave the house for significant periods of time where he is fed solid food and drinks juice. He has not been weaned despite the offender saying she had attempted to do so. However, that circumstance is not such that I consider there should be any delay in sentencing for this matter. 7 No doubt the offender’s children will suffer significantly from the fact that their mother must be punished for what she has done, but that hardship is not exceptional by any means. It is a distressingly common consequence of committing an offence that innocent third parties, particularly children, suffer. For those reasons, the position of the offender’s family has not had any significant impact on the sentence I will impose. 8 The extent of the loss and the extent of the offender’s wrongdoing is considerable indeed. I mentioned before the year 2006. In that year, the offender illegally took almost a million dollars from her employer. It must be remembered also that that money was received tax free. The extent to which the offender has unjustly and illegally benefited and the extent to which her employer has suffered a loss is of course a significant part of determining an appropriate sentence in this case. The loss has been, it need hardly be said, substantial. It is also to be noted that each offence of embezzlement seems to involve multiple acts of criminality, the decision being taken by the prosecuting authorities to divide matters up in a way that did not involve separate consideration to each separate act of embezzlement. Of course, the offences were planned, organised and committed for financial gain. 9 The question of whether the offender is remorseful arises. She said she was sorry when giving evidence-in-chief but when I asked what she meant, she said she was sorry for what she had done because of the impact on her children. That is not remorse as the term is used in s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The offender is unlikely to commit further offences of this kind in the future, if only because she is unlikely to be put in a position where she can commit further offences of this kind. I cannot say apart from that that her prospects of rehabilitation are good. Hopefully the personal deterrent aspect of the sentence I will shortly announce will play its part in enabling the offender to rehabilitate herself. The offender suggests that she voluntarily gave up her criminal activities. The onus of proving that is upon her on the balance of probabilities and I am not satisfied that she has proved that feature. The objective circumstances suggest that the offences only stopped once the appellant was unable to commit the offences, perhaps because she was on maternity leave, but certainly nothing in the objective circumstances suggests the offender did, as she said, stop because she felt guilty about what she had done. To the contrary, I am satisfied that having achieved success after success after success, the appellant had become emboldened to the extent that she thought she could get away with it and that she was going to continue committing these offences whenever she could.10 One matter I have not mentioned, but should, is that the offender’s time in custody will be harder then it would otherwise have been because of the circumstance that she will be separated from her children, and at least for some period will be separated from her baby. It may be that the mothers and children program will operate such that she can look after the baby in custody, but that is not guaranteed and it is not possible, if it does occur, to happen for some time. 11 I regard the most serious of these matters to be the series of offences committed in 2006, not only because of the amount of money involved but because they represent the culmination of a lengthy period of offending. True it is that there were some offences in 2007 but the amount involved was relatively small. For that reason, what I propose to do is impose concurrent sentences on all matters apart from the offence relating to the period 14 January 2006 to 30 December 2006 and impose upon that matter a sentence which has an element of accumulation. I have been careful not to double count the circumstance of aggravation by regarding the offence in 2006 as the most serious because of it coming after a series of earlier offences and also to justify partial accumulation. I am prepared to find special circumstances in the offender’s favour, this is the first time that she will serve a sentence for imprisonment. So the sentences are as follows:12 On all offences, apart from the offence of embezzlement by a clerk relating to the period 14 January 2006 to 30 December 2006, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of three years to date from today, 28 March 2008. That is a fixed term because of the sentence I will announce on the remaining offence. For the offence of embezzlement by a clerk for the period 14 January 2006 to 30 December 2006 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, I set a non-parole period of two years with a balance of term of two years to date from 28 March 2009. It has been my intention that the sentence will be effectively one of a non-parole period of three years with a head sentence of five years.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Sean Lindsay Cassidy appears today for sentence, having committed a most serious offence indeed. He pleaded guilty this morning to an offence of having intentionally destroyed a number of motor vehicles and a dwelling house with the intent it would endanger the life of a named person. The maximum penalty for that offence is twenty-five years imprisonment. That in itself reflects the seriousness with which I should treat Mr Cassidy’s misconduct.2 Although it was a case where he pleaded guilty today on indictment, it is accepted by the crown that in fact the offender entered his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity in the Local Court, on indictment being required because of a defect in the committal papers. Accordingly, the sentence I will ultimately impose upon Mr Cassidy is 25 per cent less than it would otherwise have been.3 The offences arose out of a neighbourhood dispute involving a Mr Genigzakis and a number of other people who lived in the area where he lived. It was Mr Genigzakis’ habit to have a number of unregistered motor vehicles parked around his property.4 One evening, 16 September 2009, he and his partner were at home watching TV when they heard noises outside. It sounded to them as though someone was opening the doors of the cars parked outside. Mr Genigzakis therefore went outside where he saw a number of young people. He challenged them, saying, “What the fuck are you doing at my car?” to which one replied, “We’re not doing anything, you fucking cunt.” This was the start of a confrontation between the group of young people and Mr Genigzakis.5 There is no evidence before me that the offender was part of the group of young people. However, he certainly learnt about the altercation and took offence at it.6 What Mr Genigzakis said included these words, “Go back to your drug dealing parents.”  When he said this he saw some people standing out the front of 17 Brown Street. It turns out that a person that the offender refers to as an aunt lived there. Out the front of 17 Brown Street were a man and a woman. Mr Genigzakis said to them,  
     
      
      “Everyone in the neighbourhood knows you’re fucking drug dealers. Everyone knows that 13 and 17 Brown Street and 19 Burnett Street and the people in McKellar Street are nothing but fucking drug dealers and junkies. Your four houses have held the whole community to ransom.” 
      
    7 This was scarcely likely to calm things down and they certainly did not. It was at this stage that the man who was out the front of 17 Brown Street said, “We’re going to burn your fucking house down.” Police were called by Mr Genigzakis’ partner. They spoke to the victim, Mr Genigzakis; they spoke to a number of other people. It was obvious that there was an ongoing dispute between Mr Genigzakis and many other residents in the neighbourhood. Police left the area and things seemed to calm down. 8 Mr Genigzakis went back inside where he resumed watching television and he fell asleep in the lounge room. His partner had gone up to bed on the second storey of the home, where she too fell asleep.9 In the early hours of the following day, at about 12.05am in fact, Mr Genigzakis was woken to the sound of windows smashing and flames coming through the lounge room windows. He could feel the heat coming through the windows and when he looked at the lounge room roof he saw that it was about to collapse. Fortunately, his partner had also been woken. She yelled at him to get out of the house. They both ran past some of the cars parked outside. As they got near one of them, an LPG powered vehicle, the gas cylinder exploded, throwing Mr Genigzakis about ten metres. He got to his feet and saw a wall of fire engulfing both his cars and his home.10 It is fortunate indeed that both Mr Genigzakis and his partner were able to escape the conflagration. It is a matter of good fortune for the offender that he is not in a different court facing two much more serious matters.11 Police and fire brigades attended and eventually the fire was put out. Enquiries pointed to the source of the fire being the vicinity of the rear right hand side of the motor vehicle which had exploded. Examination of the scene revealed that the explosion was so forceful that parts of the car were thrown 50 metres away. 12 The damage Mr Genigzakis suffered included the total loss of his home and four of his vehicles. The financial loss was in excess of half a million dollars. Other premises were also damaged by the intensity of the fire and the explosion.13 It was not long before the offender was identified as the person responsible. In lawfully intercepted telephone calls he spoke about placing what he described as a “napalm bomb” in the rear seat of the black coloured car, which was the one that exploded, next to the gas cylinder and setting fire to the device.14 The statement of facts reveals that the offender did know that he was putting what he described as the napalm bomb next to a gas cylinder. It was not an unintended consequence that the gas cylinder would explode, it seems to have been precisely what the offender wanted to happen.15 In these intercepted calls the offender also spoke about what he was wearing and what he did afterwards. He also said that he proposed to create a false alibi, suggesting that he was in Narromine at the relevant time. Police then arrested the offender and he has been in custody since 30 September 2009. He did, as police expected, suggest that he was in Narromine and told police who could provide an alibi for him. However, as is clear, that alibi was shown to be false. Upon searching 13 Brown Street, an address associated with the accused, police found clothing which incriminated the offender as well as fuel and empty fuel containers.16 Ms Gail Harris also spoke to the police about the offender’s movements and having heard the offender say, about Mr Genigzakis, “I’m fuckin’ sick of the way he talks to the women in this street. He needs a good bashing”.17 It was clear that Ms Harris had at least her suspicions that the offender was responsible for the fire because as soon as she saw him the following morning she said to him, “What the fuck have you done, Sean?” to which the offender replied,  
     
      
      “I didn’t do a good enough job, they’re still alive. They shouldn’t have been able to get out of the house if the fire had spread like it was supposed to.” 
      
    18 This expression of a complete absence of remorse on the part of the offender has continued. There is no evidence before me that he is in the slightest way sorry for having risked the lives of Mr Genigzakis or his partner and, indeed, the only evidence before me suggests that he remains disappointed that they are still alive.19 Included in the material tendered on behalf of the Crown are some letters that the offender has written from prison. The highest that Mr Booth was able to suggest to put things in suggesting that the offender was remorseful is the offender’s statement that he is sorry because he “fucked up big time”.20 I am satisfied, however, that what the offender meant to convey by those words is that he is sorry for his family, for what he has done to them. Perhaps he is sorry that he was caught or he is sorry for what he is now putting his family through, but it remains the case that the offender is in no way remorseful, in no way sorry, for having committed the offence. To Auntie Gail he said, “I should have killed him when I had the chance.”  He wants to teach the offender a lesson because of what he did to his family.21 The seriousness of the offender’s misconduct is obvious. He deliberately placed the bomb in a position where it was next to an LPG fuel tank. It was his intention that the fire would spread in such a way that the people inside the house would not get out alive and even to this day it seems he wishes that he had succeeded. Such criminality, as is obvious, requires harsh, perhaps even a draconian sentence.22 Mr Booth called no evidence, nor did he tender any documents in his case, apparently upon his client’s express instructions. There was no pre-sentence report available in the material tendered by the Crown and so I am left to glean what I can about the offender and his background from very limited evidence indeed. From that I can work out that he is now twenty-four years of age and that he was twenty-three at the time of the offence. He has an extensive list of offending on his criminal history. All of the matters, however, to date, have been dealt with in the Local Court, with none of them being dealt with in the District Court.23 In circumstances where the offender seemed to take objection to the reference to drugs being made by Mr Genigzakis, it is important to note or it is perhaps relevant to note that the offender has one matter on his criminal history of possessing a prohibited drug. I can tell from the letters that he has a family who love him and support him but that seems to be the limit of the evidence that I have before me as to matters personal to the offender.24 Mr Booth submitted that the offender’s motivation was a misplaced sense of grievance. That seems to be the case. The offender seems to have objected to Mr Genigzakis’ claim that the people in number 17, where his Auntie Gail lived, were involved in drugs. There is no evidence before me as to the accuracy or otherwise of Mr Genigzakis’ complaints but even if they were entirely baseless, to say that the offender’s reaction was an over-reaction is something of an understatement.25 Nor was this a spur of the moment decision. The offender would have taken some time to assemble the materials to produce what he described as “the napalm bomb”, all the while having the capacity to reflect on what he was doing. I state the obvious here but it is one thing to destroy the property of someone you are upset with but to want them dead and to set about achieving that is a completely different matter altogether.26 There are clearly no special circumstances in this case. In any case, the length of the sentence that I will now impose is such that there is an extensive period of eligibility for parole but in any case the non-parole period that I am about to announce is the least which properly reflects the offender’s criminality.27 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment, it will date from 30 September 2009, on which date the offender was arrested and has remained in custody since then. I set a non-parole period of ten and a half years which will expire on 29 March 2020, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole and I set a head sentence of fourteen years.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: KSC appears before me today for sentence. On 1 August 2008 a jury found him guilty of one charge of sexual intercourse without consent with a person under the age of sixteen years. She was, in fact, about ten or eleven at the time. He also appears, having pleaded guilty on arraignment at an earlier trial, to a charge of common assault on a person called CB, and he is convicted of that offence.2 The circumstances of the sexual assault offence are as follows. The offence took place between the beginning of 1983 and 6 April 1985. At the time the offender was a serving police officer and was the officer in charge of a one man police station. The complainant’s mother was a cousin of the offender’s wife. The offender’s wife seemed to have fairly close family relationships with members of her family.3 Shortly before the offence, the complainant’s mother and her two daughters had been living at East Campbelltown, while the offender and his family lived at Campbelltown. At that time there was close contact between the two families. However, the complainant’s mother and the offender’s family both moved out of the Campbelltown area and contact between them became less frequent.4 The residence at the police station had a large garden and apparently, at the relevant time, there were swings, a trampoline and it was a pleasant place for children to play.5 I should make some comments here about the reliability of the offender and his wife. I have come to the conclusion, in respect of both proceedings, that neither the offender nor his wife was a witness to be believed on oath. Therefore, where there is a conflict in the evidence between that of the offender or of his wife, and that of another witness, I would generally prefer the other witness. The offender appeared to be prepared to deny the truth or fabricate the truth in order to exonerate himself, and his wife, who is extremely devoted to him, appeared to be very much influenced by both him and her desire to maintain his innocence.6 The evidence of the complainant’s mother was that the offender’s wife had invited the two daughters, the complainant and her sister, to stay overnight so that they could get to know their cousins and cement bonds within the extended family. The complainant’s mother was adamant that this took place on at least one, and possibly more, occasions. The offender and his wife gave evidence that they could not remember these girls staying overnight and indeed the children, including friends of their own children, rarely stayed overnight, as there was no accommodation for them. I do not accept this evidence and obviously the jury did not do so, particularly in view of the fact that the offender’s son gave evidence that there was spare bedding in the house, including a mattress and a folding bed upon which guests frequently slept.7 On the occasion in question, the complainant’s evidence was that she was asleep in the room with her sister. She awoke to find that her pyjamas were around her ankles, the offender was lying on her legs, pinning them down, and licking her vagina. The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this offence took place.8 It did occur many years ago, but that does not diminish its seriousness. The offender was at the time a serving police officer, and the complainant and her sister both remembered him wearing a police uniform and being a figure of considerable authority. On the complainant’s evidence, this was a reason why she did not make an early complaint about the offence. The offence now carries a standard non-parole period of ten years imprisonment. At the time, that was, in fact, the maximum penalty for this offence, and there was no standard non-parole period. Nevertheless, the offence has always been regarded as being extremely serious.9 There is no doubt that the complainant was terrified by the offence, and has retained a deep seated fear of the offender, in particular, and of the police generally, and there have been other permanent effects of which she spoke eloquently in the victim impact statement that she read to the court. One consequence of this, and it is just an example, is that she has never held a driving licence, because of her fear of the police.10 Because this is a sexual offence against a child, and the offender was formerly a police officer, I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that he will serve his sentence in conditions that are harsher than those that would be imposed on ordinary prisoners. Certainly, the Court of Criminal Appeal, in cases such as Durocher-Yvon (2003) 58 NSWLR 581 and Mostyn (2004) 145 A Crim R 304, has indicated that it is not necessary that persons who commit particular classes of offences will serve the whole of their sentences in restrictive conditions. However, those remarks were made in the context of people who were not both former police officers and convicted child sex offenders. I am satisfied, on the basis of the material relating to the offender’s custody to date, and the evidence of his wife, that he will serve the whole of his period in custody in conditions which will carry with them a degree of harshness not imposed upon most prisoners, although I doubt that he will continue to serve his sentence in what has been virtually solitary confinement. There are, for those reasons, special circumstances that affect the sentence.11 At the time of this offence, the offender was a person of prior good character. There is some evidence that even at that time, he was beginning to suffer some symptoms of mental disorders, which ultimately developed into post traumatic stress disorder, from which he suffered for a while, and depression. This is hardly surprising. Police officers, particularly those in single officer police stations, are exposed to traumatic events. In the medical material before me, there are a number of examples that this offender has told psychologists and psychiatrists about, which involved him seeing extremely distressing matters involving death, disfigurements and other matters, particularly involving children, and it is hardly a surprise that a person exposed to those events would develop some mental problems. 12 However, I am not satisfied that this offence, occurring between 1983 and 1985, was affected by the offender’s mental problems. The mental problems from which he continues to suffer have to a large extent resolved with medication and treatment. I am satisfied that he still suffers from anxiety and depression, which may be another reason, but not the principle one, for finding special circumstances.13 Because this offence took place some 25 or so years ago, I am required to undertake an extremely difficult exercise, which has not become any easier since I first was confronted with this. In the case of MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129, a Court of Criminal Appeal consisting of five judges held that when sentencing for an offence, the court should take into account the sentencing practice at the date of the commission of the offence. I understand, and I think it is agreed between counsel, that at the time of this offence the general practice was to impose a head sentence, or a minimum term, and an additional term … of between one third and one half.14 I have been provided with a number of indications of the type of sentences that were imposed for sexual offences against children at the time. None of them is directly comparable to this case. All of them, I understand, were pleas of guilty, which is the first ground of distinction. Most of them were multiple offences, and so far as I am aware, on the limited information available to me, none of them involved a sexual assault on a child in circumstances similar to those that I have already described. This is a case where, as I have said, the offender was a person of prior good character, and all those facts are matters which I take into account when I decide the relevant sentence.15 I should say that the offender has spent in custody a period of about seven weeks after his arrest and some nearly four months since the jury found him guilty of that offence. He was on bail for a significant period between those two terms in custody.16 The second offence is a charge of common assault. The plea was not entered at the earliest opportunity by any means. Indeed, it was only entered at the beginning of the trial, after the offender had the opportunity to plead if he so wished in the Local Court. Although it was a plea of guilty, there remained a conflict as to what actually happened and it was necessary for evidence on this point to be given at the trial by the offender, by the complainant and other witnesses, and for that reason, the discount for the plea of guilty will be relatively small.17 The complainant’s account of what happened on 20 March 2004 was as follows: 
     
      
      “Q. This is the same B that we’ve been talking about. BH ? 
      
     
     
      
      A. Yes. Anyway yeah, I could just see K was not in a good mood. I kept going because I really wanted to watch B play soccer and he -yeah, he just told me to ‘piss off’. He picked up his ice cream and threw his bowl of ice cream at me. I was standing between his bed and here. He threw the ice cream at me and then he got up from the bed and grabbed me by my throat and pushed me to the door and was yelling. Then D walked up, but he had released his hands at that point. She was saying ‘what’s going on? What’s going on?’ I told her what he had done. She was angry and upset, saying ‘don’t you touch her’ or something along those lines.  
      
     
     
      
      I said ‘that’s it, I’m leaving. I’ve had enough’. I was an emotional wreck. I went to my bedroom. He followed me in and was ripping out my drawers, throwing my clothes around and screaming and carrying on. He shoved D who was also standing in the room at the time, carrying on. He shoved D, he shoved her out of the way. She was crying. She got on the phone to her eldest son, M and she was screaming into the phone ‘help, help. Your father has choked C. I don’t know what to do.’ She was upset. I just said ‘I’m leaving’ and he said ‘don’t worry, you’re kicked out’, whatever. He was just throwing my room apart. Then from that M came - came to the house from his house and came to pick me up. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Where did he pick you up from? 
      
     
     
      
      A. He came to the house, but I was - but it was when I went over to my girlfriend’s house. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. To LM’s house? 
      
     
     
      
      A. To LM’s house across the road and M came in. I was an emotional wreck. He said ‘come on mate, come with me’. We went to M’s house. I was distraught.” 
      
    18 That is from pp 115 to 116 of the transcript. The offender’s version was as follows: 
     
      
      “Q. What did you do when you went into the bedroom? 
       
       
      A. I got a bowl of ice cream and started watching a movie. I lay on my side of the bed and started watching the movie and eating ice cream. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What happened later? 
      
     
     
      
      A. Some time later C came in the bedroom door and knelt up on the bed on my wife’s side and started talking to me and she said ‘I want to talk to you about B’. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What did you say? 
      
     
     
      
      A. I said ‘I don’t want to talk about it at the moment.’ 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What happened next? 
       
       
      A. She kept on talking about it. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What did you do? 
      
     
     
      
      A. I used a strategy that I had learned. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Just tell us what you did? 
      
     
     
      
      A. I said ‘go out’. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What happened then? 
      
     
     
      
      A. She kept on. I said ‘go out’. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Hmm? 
      
     
     
      
      A. She then kept on about it and I said ‘get out’. I said ‘get out’ and then she got off the bed, backed off the bed, turned and started walking out. She said to me’ you don’t have to speak to me like I’m a fucking dog’. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What did you do? 
      
     
     
      
      A. I just looked at her and I watched the movie. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What happened next? 
      
     
     
      
      A. A couple of moments later she disappeared around the hallway, which is down towards the kitchen and then she came back and she walked into the middle of the hallway, opposite the doorway and was standing there sort of taunting me. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Then what happened next? 
      
     
     
      
      A. I finished the ice cream. I wanted to get rid of her. I picked up the bowl and threw it like that at her foot on the floor. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What happened then? 
      
     
     
      
      A. She said ‘Aunt, he did it’. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. What happened then? 
      
     
     
      
      A. I walked out, picked up the bowl with my left hand, put it in my right hand. I still had the spoon. She started yelling at me ‘you won’t let me see B’ and started waving her arm around. I put my left hand up like that and she kept yelling. I just moved toward her. She kept on doing it. I just pushed her. I didn’t want to push her on the breasts or anything, I just pushed her like that and my hand was on her throat. She was against the flat patterned panel in the doorway at the side of the door and then I stopped.” 
      
    19 That passage is from pp 492 to 493 of the transcript.20 MC, the son of the offender, gave evidence that he drove some distance from his home to his parents’ house to collect C and take her home with him. In fact he collected her from her friend’s house across the street. He gave evidence of a telephone call from his mother, which prompted him to take this action. His recollection was that his mother had been agitated and had told him to come and collect C because his father was hurting her.21 DC also gave evidence. She conceded that she telephoned her son, but denied that she had ever said that her husband had been hurting the complainant. She said that she did not actually witness the incident.22 It is not in dispute that after this incident, the complainant, who was then eighteen years old and had lived as a daughter of the household since she was nine, left the house and never returned to stay. In the circumstances, I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the version of events given by the complainant is correct. I have had the opportunity to observe the offender and his wife give evidence and I have formed certain opinions about that. Even if I had not formed that opinion, it is difficult to believe that if the events had happened as the offender described them, it would have been sufficient to cause the complainant to leave the house permanently or, indeed, that it would have been sufficient to cause MC to drive for fifty to sixty minutes to collect the complainant and take her to his own home. I also formed the view that DC had actually seen some of these events, or a significant part of them, despite her denial.23 I have formed the view that this was a violent and serious assault. It is an example of an extremely serious type of domestic violence. If the matter had been dealt with in the Local Court, the maximum penalty would have been twelve months imprisonment. The offender chose not to enter his plea in that court and must accept the consequences. Because of the conviction of the sexual assault offence, the offender cannot be regarded as a person of previous good character. Again, I have already mentioned that the offender is a former police officer who has been convicted of a sexual offence against children, and that will affect the conditions in which he has to serve his sentence under strict, more stringent conditions than would otherwise apply.24 In the case of this offence, which occurred in 2004, there is considerable evidence that at the time, the offender was suffering from quite severe mental problems. By the time of the offence, he had not yet started his new regime of medication, and I am satisfied that he was still suffering the effects not only of depression, which has affected him for some time, but some effects of post traumatic stress. Dr Smith, whose opinion I accept, has diagnosed him as follows: 
     
      
      “He has evidence of a chronic adjustment disorder, with depressed and anxious mood. He reveals features often noted in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder” 
      
    25 Dr Smith, however, was not prepared to say that he was suffering from that condition at the time that he examined him in May of this year.26 I also have some evidence in the form of a report from another psychiatrist, Dr Allnutt, which is not in any way inconsistent with the opinion of Dr Smith.27 There is also evidence from the police records that between 2000 and the time of the offence, the police were concerned about KSC's condition. They had referred him, at one stage, to an anxiety/depression management course in 2003. He certainly reported the incident which gave rise to the charges to the psychologist, Ms Powell, in June 2004, and I am satisfied that at the time of this offence, he was suffering from a mental disorder, with the consequence that although it does not absolve him from responsibility, it does lessen the degree to which general deterrence is an element in the sentence that is to be imposed.28 Mr Boulten, who appears for KSC, and has done so throughout these proceedings, has suggested that this is a matter which in the Magistrates Court probably would not have attracted a custodial sentence. I am not prepared to accept that submission. This was a serious assault by a man who was in the position of the father of the complainant. He was certainly the uncle of the complainant, and he reacted to her in a violent and frenzied way, even though to some extent that may have been the result of his mental condition. It is still a matter which, in my view, does warrant a significant custodial sentence.29 The two sentences, in my view, must be partly accumulated.30 Having had regard to the material that was put before me, by both Mr Boulten and by the Crown Prosecutor, as I have said, I cannot be satisfied that any case to which I have been referred is directly on point. I have been referred to matters compiled by the Public Defenders and, as I have said, most of those relate to matters which cannot be regarded as analogous, and which were the result of pleas of guilty.31 On the charge of sexual intercourse without consent, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of three years, starting on 16 June 2008 and expiring on 15 June 2011. The total term will be five years, expiring on 15 June 2013. On the charge of assault, the element of mental illness has led me to impose a sentence which is somewhat shorter than I would otherwise have imposed. It will be a sentence of nine months non-parole period, commencing on 16 January 2011. That non-parole period will expire on 15 October 2011. There will be a total term of eighteen months, expiring on 15 July 2012.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: In this matter the appellant, Chetty Shakuntala, was convicted in the Local Court of a speeding matter. She was detected by a speed camera exceeding the speed limit by fifteen kilometres an hour or less. The actual speed was seventy-five in a sixty zone. The Magistrate fined her $80 and ordered that she pay court costs of $73. It appears that the matter was disputed in the Local Court with the appellant pleading not guilty. She has however appealed only against the severity of the sentence imposed upon her.2 Early in the appeal proceedings I raised with Mr Nair, who appeared for the appellant, the possibility that his client could find her sentence actually increased. I pointed out that she was on a good behaviour licence at the time and pleaded not guilty. Mr Nair then indicated after receiving instructions that his client wished to proceed with the appeal apparently on the basis that his client was concerned that she would lose her licence because of the accumulation of points that this offence represented. I told Mr Nair it was my understanding of the law that even if I gave his client the benefit of an order under s 10 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the RTA would still take the points from the appellant and so I questioned the utility of the appeal. The Crown indicated that my understanding of the law was correct. 3 The matter was then adjourned until 2 o’clock so that Mr Nair could obtain instructions and review the law. When he returned at two he indicated that his client wished to have leave to withdraw her appeal. I granted that leave.4 It is a matter of some considerable concern that this whole appeal has been based on a false premise. It is a matter of considerable concern that Mr Nair, as a solicitor, has apparently given his client advice which is completely wrong, thus wasting the court’s time, and wasting his client’s time. Nor, as I understand it, is this a recent change in the law. It is one which Mr Nair should have become aware of before proceeding with this appeal on his client’s behalf. 5 There is another matter of concern raised as well. It concerns his client’s continued driving. In written submissions handed to me by Mr Nair is a document, I will receive it as evidence. It is a letter from a neurologist Henry Miller to Dr Daniel Teo. It concerns suggestions that the appellant has been having seizures. I am greatly concerned as to whether the appellant should continue to have a licence to drive. It is not of course for me to decide this matter but having been made aware of the appellant’s neurological history, at least as insofar as it is contained in the letter to which I have referred, it is incumbent upon me to make sure that the RTA is made aware of this matter so that it can review whether the appellant should continue to be licensed to drive. It goes without saying that the risks to others on the road are significant if the appellant is having seizures. 6 I will therefore direct that the RTA be provided with a copy of these remarks, and a copy of the letter from Dr Henry Miller to Dr Daniel Teo dated 3 July 2008 in order that the question as to whether the appellant should continue to drive may be properly reviewed.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: On 16 February, 2009 the offender pleaded guilty to the following count on an indictment; 
     
      
      That on 7 February 2007 at Belmore South in the state of New South Wales she unlawfully did kill ML.  
      
    That count was laid under section 18 (1) (b) of the Crimes Act, 1900. The maximum penalty for that offence is 25 years imprisonment.Facts2 A statement of agreed facts was tendered (exhibit S5). Some of the relevant facts and chronological details of the relevant matters are as follows:3 The victim, ML was born on 1 December 2006. He was about 9 weeks old at the time of his death. The offender, his mother, was then aged 26.4 ML was born suffering with suspected withdrawal symptoms and was given Vitamin K. He was monitored by a midwife on weekly home visits until he was eight weeks old. Those visits came to an end about a week before his death. In January 2007 the midwife organized for one of the offender’s sisters, Monique, to take ML for a weekend of respite care. 5 On 15 January 2007, when ML was about six weeks old the offender, was taken by Ms Hornby-Howell, a midwife, to see a general practitioner, Dr Parkin. The offender said then that she was, “not coping with things and not bonding with ML.” She tested positive for amphetamines in a urine test on that day. 6 There were further concerns noted by a Child and Family Health nurse about the offender’s parenting skills at the end of January 2007. That nurse noted that ML was well at that stage. No health problems were reported by the offender. An appointment was made for the offender to see another general practitioner, Dr Harvey, on 2 February. At that stage there was no mention by the offender that ML was unwell. 7 A neighbour, Ms Kelly Campbell, said that she had visited the offender on the Saturday, 3 February 2007. At that time the offender complained about ML crying, saying, “He just doesn’t fucking stop crying. He just doesn’t fucking shut up.” In addition, Ms Campbell observed the offender pick ML up, putting her hands under his arms, and violently shaking him shouting out, “I should buy you a fucking skirt”. Ms Campbell described the offender as being, “very, very angry” when she shook ML. By way of replication, she demonstrated a corkscrew motion with the offender holding the baby in front of her, about 20 cms from her face, and screaming at him, while shaking him very violently. She said she could not count the number of shakes, because, “it was happening so fast”. 8 Ms Campbell also said that the offender, “was on methylamphetamine at the time and that Mr G had injected her.”9 When the offender’s then partner, Mr G, came downstairs on that occasion, he described the offender as looking, “very pissed off”.10 The offender left her home on Monday, 5 February 2007 to pick up Mr G’s seven-year-old daughter. She left ML in the care of her then partner, Mr G, who was asleep in the house. ML was lying on the lounge with him.11 The offender did not go back to her home, but went to Ms Campbell’s house. She asked Ms Campbell if she could borrow some milk with which to make Mr G a cup of coffee, and then asked whether Ms Campbell could drive the offender and the baby ML to the hospital. She told Ms Campbell that ML was very ill. She said he had been, “peeing blood” and had only consumed about 10 mils of liquid in the past 24 hours. Ms Campbell said she would come and see ML and the offender left the house.12 In the meantime, Mr G’s seven year old daughter, SG, had entered the house. She went up the stairs to change out of her school uniform. She said that her father then went down stairs to give ML a bottle, and SG followed not long later. She saw her father bend down beside ML and say, “bubba, bubba,wake up bubba” SG then said, “but bubba wasn’t breathing or moving, he was doing nothing”. 13 The offender then entered the house and immediately asked Mr G whether the baby was breathing. When she was told of the baby’s condition she then ran out of the house screaming for assistance. A telephone call was made to the triple 0 call centre. The offender indicated that her 2 month old baby was not breathing. Instructions on mouth to mouth resuscitation were given, with the offender passing those instructions on to Mr G. After a short time, in mid-call, the offender hung up the call and went outside. She later told police she did this because she could not cope with emotional situation. A triple 0 operator phoned back and Mr G answered the call. 14 When neighbours came into the house, one of them observed that the baby was laying flat on its back, was still and going purple with blue around its lips and face. When the ambulance officers attended, the baby was cyanotic and non-responsive to pain.15 On the admission of ML to hospital Mr G volunteered that ML had been unwell since the preceding Friday. In a later interview with police he said ML had been sick for a few days, pale, lethargic and vomiting and was getting worse. He noticed that ML was not breathing at about 3pm on 5 February. Reports to hospital16 On admission, ML was seen by Dr Anscombe, an Emergency Specialist and General Paediatrician at the John Hunter Hospital. He recalls a conversation with the offender, and Mr G, with reports of ML being generally unwell for 3 days, with poor feeding and sleepiness. No complaint was made of vomiting or diarrhoea. 17 Dr Anne Piper took over from Dr Anscombe. Dr Piper is a Staff Specialist Paediatrician, with a specialty in Child Protection. The offender told Dr Piper that ML had been, “pooing and peeing”. The only medical concern the offender and Mr G raised was oral thrush, apparently having resulted from ML’s bottles not being sterilised. That was clearly either a minimization or a failure to report to the relevant medical authorities what had happened to the child and the subsequent physical symptoms, which must have been within the knowledge of at least the offender.Death and diagnosis18 ML died on 7 February 2007. The diagnosis was that he had suffered and died from inflicted injury with the cause almost certainly being a severe shaking episode.19 The medical experts agreed that ML had suffered a violent shaking episode and had substantial bleeding in his brain leading to brain swelling and brain death. The mechanism of the brain injury was non-accidental trauma. The bleeding was described as fairly recent.Extent of injuries20 An autopsy was performed by Dr Nadesan on the 8 February 2007. The extent of the injuries is contained in Dr Piper’s summary as follows: 
     
      
      1. There were subdural haematomas and cerebral haemorrhages accompanied and followed by acute severe brain oedema; buponic brain damage; 
      
     
     
      
      2. There was extensive retinal haemorrhages of multiple layers; 
      
     
     
      
      3. There were no signs of injury on external examination, nor skeletal fractures; 
      
     
     
      
      4. There was no evidence of a medical condition or bleeding disorder, nor blood in his urine. 
      
    Reports and admissions by offender21 While at the hospital Mr G volunteered that ML had been unwell since the preceding Friday. The offender was told that the doctors at the hospital would have to notify DOCS. The offender looked concerned and said she had had a, “hassle” with DOCS in the past. The offender directed hospital staff they were not to tell her family anything about ML’s condition or prognosis. 22 The offender was aggressive when interviewed by police, telling them her memory was bad. She said that she had suffered psychological damage from past traumatic experiences, when she was raped. She made no admissions about harming ML. Indeed, her comments at the hospital were to the effect that, “I wouldn’t hurt my baby”. That was clearly false.Evidence on Sentencing Proceedings23 The offender’s father, Mr L, gave evidence. He is the District Manager of the Community Services office in western, NSW. He and his wife also had 18 years work experience with the Salvation Army. 24 Mr and Mrs L were proposing to have ML come and live with them but those arrangements did not eventuate. The offender choose to continue having ML living with her and Mr G. Mr L said the offender now has another relationship with another person, called Scott. Psychiatrist’s report25 A psychiatrist’s report from Dr Bruce Westmore dated 30 April 2009 (exhibit S1) was tendered. A pre-sentence report was not sought.26 Dr Westmore set out that the offender had been treated by her general practitioner for depression and substance abuse for many years. She had also been prescribed anti-depressants and anti-psychotic medication. Dr Westmore also noted the offender’s reported history of significant trauma, including her description of being raped at the age of sixteen, and being the victim of two subsequent sexual assaults.27 The report also noted that Ms L said she was using illicit substances on a regular basis several times a day at the time ML died. She reported impaired memory in relation to the details of what occurred but a witness said that she saw Ms L shaking the child. Ms L told Dr Westmore that she had been taking psychiatric medication at the time her son died.28 Dr Westmore’s opinion was that the offender is a person with multiple social, psychological and psychiatric problems. She had a history of a depressed mood and ‘possibly a recurrent major depressive illness’. It was unclear whether, as a matter of cause and effect, her history of drug abuse has a connection with the particular incident. Dr Westmore noted that the offender had serious and extensive personality difficulties and that she needed to maintain her sobriety from illicit drugs. Such abstinence might improve her long term prognosis.29 Dr Westmore thought that on-going psychological support provided by a community based mental health service should be provided for the offender. Significantly Dr Westmore noted that, “It would be advisable if Ms L did not fall pregnant again.”30 There was no expression of remorse by the offender to Dr. Westmore not to any one else. That needs to be considered in the light of Mr L’s evidence that his daughter had difficulties in her capacity to express emotions and her reaction and comments at the hospital after ML died. Medical Reports31 A report from Dr Terry Parkin, general practitioner of Newcastle, dated 12 March 2008, was tendered (exhibit S2). Dr Parkin had been the general practitioner for the offender. 32 The report noted that the midwifery team at the John Hunter Hospital had reported that Ms L was not coping with ML at age six weeks, nor was she bonding with the child. Ms L was also concerned about her mood swings and the absence of support from her partner and the midwifery team. Ms L had missed several appointments at Dr Parkin’s surgery and gave as an excuse the absence of transport.33 A urine test was carried out on the offender on the 15 January indicating a positive result for amphetamine. Ms L said that her, “drink had been spiked”. Dr Parkin had also noted Ms L’s heroin usage in addition to her amphetamine usage, as well as the other antipsychotic and related medication she had been using. Ms L had had a relapse of Hepatitis C and had had a liver biopsy.34 Ms L reported episodes of, “losing it” at times when she felt unable to control herself. Apparently she was tested by way of a CT Scan but there was no organic cause for her mood swings and anger outbursts.Personal circumstances35 The offender is aged 30 – her date of birth is 29 May, 1979. She has two other children, Mik L, born 4 September 1998, and NL, born 17 September 2001, both of whom are being looked after by her parents. The elder daughter has lived with her grandparents since she was six months old, pursuant to Family Court orders. The younger daughter has lived with Ms L’s parents for about two years dating from a couple of months prior to ML’s death. The grandparents have the care of the children following DOC's involvement. They currently live in western NSW and have some limited contact with their mother including by phone. 36 The father of ML was a man called Shane. The child resulted from a six-month relationship although the parties did not live together during that time. The pregnancy with ML was not planned and Ms L’s reports to various doctors was that she was, “a bit depressed during the ante-natal period.” 37 The offender had been living with Mr G for a month prior to ML’s birth. Mr G’s seven-year-old daughter SG, also lived in the house. The offender is apparently now in another relationship with a person called Scott.Family38 Ms L is the youngest of five children – she has three sisters and a brother. Both her parents are or have been members of the NSW Probation and Parole Service. They have provided significant assistance for the offender in caring for her and particularly her other two children.Education and Employment39 Ms L was educated to Year 10 level. She has had some part time employment in the service industry.Support 40 Ms L reported to Dr Westmore that she had been, “in and out of counselling since she was sixteen” following the reported rape on her by persons with whom she was associating in her pursuit of alcohol. No person has been convicted in relation to any of the alleged rapes but the offender had to give evidence in a trial which, according to her father, was a re-brutalisation of the experiences she had suffered during the assault and rape. 41 She had apparently been admitted to the James Fletcher Hospital in April 2007 and to the psychiatric unit at the Maitland Hospital in May 2007, both admissions occurring after the death of ML. Drug and Alcohol History42 Ms L started using amphetamines at the age of sixteen and used needles for many years. She also used heroin from the age of 18 and for a number of years. Ms L was on different medications including antipsychotic medication Seroquel and Clopixol, as well as an anti-depressant Avanza at the time of ML’s death.43 Ms L also reported to Dr Westmore that she had been in violent and abusive relationships and that one man allegedly forced her into prostitution. At one stage her drug habit was costing her $1000 per day.44 Although the offender told Dr Westmore that she had stopped using illicit substances, there is no clinical evidence to this effect, importantly, the reverse was clearly the case at, or immediately prior to, the time ML died. Section 21A factors - Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.Aggravating factors45 Here there was a clear and gross breach of trust to a vulnerable victim. Victim Impact Statement46 A victim impact statement was read by Monique, the aunt of the victim and the sister of the offender. 47 It is clear that this matter and its consequences have had a substantial impact on the offender’s wider family. Further, this impact will have long-term consequences. Mitigating factors48 The offender has no prior convictions. She pleaded guilty on the first day of what was set down as a three-week trial. The utilitarian value of the plea to the criminal justice system was significant in that there was no necessity to call the various police and medical witnesses as well as the consequential savings in the time and resources of the Court, the prosecution, the police and the legal aid authorities. There were 12 or more expert medical and other witnesses, many of which to come from Newcastle. There were some disputed facts. There were early indication of many matters, which would not be disputed, and defence counsel notified both the DPP and the Crown of that. 49 In my view there was a high utilitarian value to the Court, the parties, the DPP and the various witnesses involved. Remorse50 The offender did not give evidence. In those circumstances what remorse there is, is inherent in the plea and the inference drawn by her father from what the offender has said. Mr L said that she didn’t express remorse, but that, “in those terms, her personality didn’t permit her.”51 The discount applicable to these factors in the sentence which would otherwise be imposed should be 20%. There is an element of leniency in this approach given the decision of Howie J in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102. However, I am satisfied that in these particular circumstances there was a significant utilitarian value in the plea. Objective Seriousness52 The starting point for the consideration of penalty and the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances is that what is involved is the felonious taking of human life. 53 The Crown case is that what was involved was one-off incident. 54 Defence counsel submits that what was involved was a spontaneous act indicative of a momentary lack of control and consisted of a single event rather than a course of action. Further, that her capacity to reason and exercise judgment in a stressful situation was lessened by virtue of her psychiatric condition and intake of amphetamines. Counsel also submits that that should lessen the justification for a sentence reflecting general and personal deterrence.55 Here I consider that the objective criminality of the offence is in the middle of the range for offences of this type. The reason for that finding is that it is clear from the facts that the offender had inflicted injury to ML but it was an unplanned and spontaneous offence that was the result of her outburst of temper and inability to control herself in the circumstances of her drug usage. The injuries though serious and ultimately the cause of death, did not involve fracturing and breaking of bones and the other kinds of injuries sometimes experienced in these sorts of matters nor is there evidence of an on-going course of conduct. The Crown does not rely on any ongoing failure of care or criminal negligence on the part of the offender.Delay56 Both counsel agree that delay is not an operative factor in these circumstances either operating in favour of, or against the offender. It is accepted that none of the delays were attributable to the prosecutorial authorities or the police. However, given the period which has expired, it may be relevant to note the matters more fully detailed in exhibits S6 and S7. 57 The offence occurred on 7 February, 2007. The matter was transferred from the Newcastle District Court to the Sydney registry on 3 October, 2008 having a three week trial estimate.58 The offender pleaded guilty on 16 February, 2009 the day the matter was listed for trial in Sydney. The Crown did not oppose bail and the matter was stood over for sentence on 15 May, 2009, a date suitable to the parties and to meet expected delays in the obtaining of expert reports. Directions were made that the defence would deliver psychiatrists/psychologists reports by 1 May, 2009, the Crown having until 8 May, 2009 to serve any answering material.59 A further order was made that the agreed facts for sentence be forwarded to the Court by 1 May, 2009. Although a draft of the agreed facts was forwarded to the defence, the remaining orders and time limits were not complied with – mainly because there had been delays in obtaining relevant psychiatric material. In addition there were other trial commitments for the court and the sentence date was vacated on 11 May 2009. A suggested adjournment of one week did not suit counsel for both parties and a new sentence date of 3 July 2009 was set down.60 The renewal of the offender’s bail on 16 February, 2009 was not opposed by the Crown and the offender has been on bail since her arrest.Rehabilitation 61 The offender has been supported by a number of people and agencies over a number of years.62 However, that has not lead to a change in her behaviour; either in terms of her drug usage at the time of the death, nor in terms of her capacity to care for dependents, nor in terms of her accepting responsibility for her own actions.Authorities63 I have considered the authorities as detailed below, the sentencing principles which appear to be relevant and the sentences imposed. What is clear from the authorities is that the courts have consistently treated the killing of young children by their parents or carers as serious cases of manslaughter. Although murder convictions will ordinarily attract greater penalties than manslaughter convictions, there will be cases where it will be appropriate for higher penalties to be imposed for manslaughter than for murder. No particular sentencing pattern emerges - R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184. The vulnerability of helpless infants and the dependency they have on their parents or carers for their safety and wellbeing was also stressed in Regina v Howard [2000] NSWSC 876 and in Regina v Woodland [2001] NSWSC 416.64 Some of the relevant authorities are as follows: 
     
      
      R v Vaughan 
       (1991) 56 A Crim R 355 – The respondent was charged with manslaughter and also charged with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm for an earlier incident in which he broke her arm and leg. Two weeks after the first incident he was awoken by his daughter’s crying. He picked her up by the ankles, flung her over his shoulder and deliberately threw her head first into the couch a number of times. On appeal the court increased the manslaughter sentence to four years and six months with a non-parole period of three years and six months. 
      
     
     
      
      R v Grierson 
       NSWCCA 28 October 1996 (per Hunt CJ, Ireland and H Bell JJ) – child thrown across room, death as a result of skull fractures one-off episode of mistreatment; long history of substance abuse: marijuana, heroin; permanent psychiatric condition and post natal depression prior convictions (non-violent). Sentence: 6y, NPP 3 years. 
      
     
     
      
      R v Wilkinson 
       NSWCCA 9 August 1999 – manslaughter constituted by criminal negligence failing to protect 6 month old child - de facto co-offender with greater culpability - not full knowledge of nature and extent of injuries but aware something seriously wrong following alleged fall in shower – extensive fracture of the skull – haemorrhage and serious internal injuries – criminal negligence consisted of not responding to a situation of risk and the medical crisis the child faced. Sentence: HS 6y 3m; NPP 3y. 
      
     
     
      
      R v O’Brien 
       [2003] NSWCCA 121 - The appellant’s infant child died of malnutrition as a result of the appellant’s refusal to take her daughter to hospital for urgent medical treatment. The Crown case was that the appellant breached her duty of care to her child by a combination of acts and omissions. The defence was that the appellant suffered from battered wife syndrome and that the effects of this prevented her from initiating action to take proper steps for the welfare of the child. The appellant was sentenced to five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. 
      
     
     
      
      R v Wilson 
       (2005) 62 NSWLR 346 - The appellant shook a young child who was in her foster care causing his brain to swell and leading to asphyxia and death. The medical evidence was that this shaking would have occurred about 30 minutes before death and although she telephoned her husband and took the child to a medical centre, the attempts to resuscitate the child were unsuccessful. On appeal, she was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years and six months, with an additional term of 18 months for the grievous bodily harm count. 
      
     
     
      
      R v Mundene 
       [2007] NSWSC 355 - Male killed de facto’s 7month old son by shaking – isolated anger against crying child – warned he could injure child – breach of trust – Aboriginal with disrupted background – drug abuse – immaturity – remorse – Sentence: 6y 9m NPP 3y 9m.  
      
     
     
      
      R v Hoerler 
       [2004] NSWCCA 184. The injuries set out in that judgment were particularly horrific – see [8] – and included a crushed liver, crushed toes, multiple rib fractures and other penetrative injuries on a seven month old child. Moreover there was a continuum in the duration of violence and obvious gratuitous cruelty. The violence was intentional, repeated and severe. 
      
     
     
      
      R v Monroe 
       [2003] NSWSC 1271 the offender shook 3m baby boy – threw baby on lounge and punched in abdominal area – angry and intoxicated - Depression and heart condition – protective custody. Sentence: 7y 6m, NPP 4y 
      
    Consideration65 In addition to the considerations of general deterrence, this sentence must be such as to act as a form of specific deterrence and a mark of condemnation for the offender’s conduct in causing the death of her child as well as the inter-related facts that this conduct seems to have been directly related to, if not caused by, her drug usage immediately prior to and at the time of ML’s death. The Crown does not advance a submission of a failure to care as part of the criminality of the offender. 66 In terms of the principles to be gleaned from the authorities referred to above, what was involved here was the killing of a nine-week-old baby by his drug-addicted mother. While the wearing impact of a continually crying infant cannot be under-estimated, particularly when it has occurred over some weeks, the offender had had some help from individuals and agencies and a period of respite care over that same period. The ultimate events seem to have been more a reflection of anger and frustration without any form of self-control and the abandonment of any sense of responsibility. A defenceless and fragile nine-week-old baby died.Personal/subjective factors67 The offender is aged 30. She has two children who are being looked after by her parents. She has no prior convictions. This is somewhat surprising in view of the long history and clear pattern of multi-substance drug abuse with which the offender had been associated for some years. That abuse had been known to her parents who were or are members of the Probation and Parole Service as well as having had a variety of positions with other organisations such as the Salvation Army over some years. Her parents were aware at the time that the offender was not coping with living with ML. They were unaware that Mr G was a primary caregiver for ML. DOCS officers had been aware of her conduct and inabilities to cope with her elder two children, which led to their removal from her care and into that of their grandparents. 68 It may be that some earlier and more dramatic form of intervention would have brought it home to the offender at an earlier time that her self-destructive behaviour should be stopped before it flowed on to lead to her baby’s death. I see nothing in the evidence to indicate that she has taken responsibility for her own actions, reactions and behaviour – and particularly her drug habit and its consequences.69 It is clear from Ms Campbell’s evidence that the offender had been using methylamphetamine intravenously at the time of the offence. On the morning that ML was shaken, the offender was, “coming down and seemed tired”. It is clear that the offender reacted angrily and using her comments, that she had, “lost it” and had become agitated. In that regard it should also be noted that when the offender had tested positive for amphetamines on 15 January 2007, she replied that, “her drinks had been spiked”. Given the long term drug usage of the offender, that is a comment which may indicate her preparedness to blame others and not to face up to her own drug habits and its consequences. Ms L’s denial of her own drug usage contrasts with that of Mr G who said that Ms L had been using amphetamines during the last month of her pregnancy and that she used it about twice a day after ML was born. She said that if she did not get the drugs she would be agitated. 70 The offender has been offered assistance in the past from a variety of people including her own family, helping agencies, medical agencies and midwives. There had been weekly visits from the midwife. She had had a period of respite care. On the morning of 5 February when she contacted Ms Campbell, and when she clearly knew that there was something seriously wrong with ML. She did not contact either her family or any of the extensive range of people, professionals or helping agencies with whom she had been in contact in the previous weeks. She must have had some knowledge of what had occurred to ML given what Ms Campbell observed on 3 February and what she told Ms Campbell on 5 February 2007, namely that ML had been, “peeing blood” and had had very limited consumption of liquids in the past twenty-four hours. However, as I have said, the Crown does not rely on any kind of criminal negligence nor continuing neglect as part of the criminality involved.71 The offender as a mother of a two-month-old child had left the baby with Mr G who was asleep on a lounge. Mr G was a person who had been described by Ms Campbell as having injected the offender.72 When interviewed by the police on 6 February, she did not admit any matter relating to the care of her baby but reiterated the psychological damage she had from the past traumatic experiences when she was allegedly raped. Those events would have occurred at least six to seven years prior. Those events, and their impact and the potential for long term psychological and emotional scarring, cannot be minimized. There is no evidence which satisfies me that she will be capable of accepting her responsibility, particularly given her father’s account of how the offender had been brutalised both in the assaults on her and the subsequent trial. Her two elder children had been removed from her care. That does not appear to have led to any improvement in her conduct in terms of her maternal responsibility or her capacity to be responsible for her own actions.73 In terms of the aggravating factors listed, there was a clear and gross breach of trust to a vulnerable victim, being this two month old baby who experienced the injuries detailed in the pathologist’s report, and who was left in the care of Mr G. 74 What must also be considered are the personal factors relating to the offender, given her age, the fact that she has no prior convictions and the fact that she is going to have to live with the consequences of her conduct for the remainder of her life. In addition there is the fact that the offender has had these matters hanging over her head for about two and a half years.Special circumstances75 It was put on behalf of the offender that she required a lengthy period of supervision for her ongoing treatment for her psychiatric problems and to avoid a relapse into drug addiction. Further, that her age, (30) and the fact that she has two other children as well as the family structure and assistance available to her, warrant a finding of special circumstances.76 The difficulty with that submission is that the offender has had those children and that family for some considerable time. There has been no indication that she has used those resources nor support to rectify her lifestyle or accept responsibility for her actions, in particular, her drug taking and the persons, and the kind of persons, with whom she has associated, over the last decade.77 The prospects for her future in terms of accommodation would appear to be limited to having contact with, and possibly living with, her parents and her extended family. They may move to an area close to Newcastle. Living with her family was an arrangement, which clearly did not work in the past. It may also be disruptive to her two children should she return there after being in gaol for some years. Her father, Mr L proposed to investigate a half way home accommodation option on her release from goal. 78 I am prepared to find special circumstances based on the need for supervision, and a longer period on supervision that would normally be the case but that should be relatively limited as the effectiveness of that supervision should become fairly quickly apparent. My recommendation will be that that supervision should be close and frequent and involve random urine and other forms of analysis. The adjustment to the normal statutory ratio, which the non-parole period bears to the head sentence should be two-thirds.Sentencing options79 Despite the offender’s age and the absence of any prior convictions, I do not consider that the facts of this offence and the requirement of general and personal deterrence would be met by the imposition of a sentence other than one of full time custody. Transparency of Discounts80 Normally a sentence of facts of this nature with the factors I have listed above being present and the personal circumstances of the offender would be of the order of seven to eight years imprisonment. Applying a discount of 20% to that figure – and I have adopted the mean figure of seven and a half years – of that being the appropriate percentage I have determined for the plea and the remorse inherent in it, would lead to a head sentence of six years imprisonment. Applying the statutory ratio I have determined should be appropriate by virtue of my finding of special circumstances would result in a non-parole period of four years imprisonment. (90 months x .20 = 18 months: 72 x .66 = 48 months)Sentence81 The offender is convicted on the count to which she pleaded guilty.I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 3 July 2009 and expiring on 2 July 2013. There will be an additional term of 2 years to commence upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expire on 2 July 2015. Parole ConditionsI recommend the following conditions be established as part of the offender’s parole. 
     
      
      1. That she notify the Probation and Parole Service of her address and any person with whom she is in a relationship as well as details of her medical practitioner and any treating specialist from time to time.  
      
     
     
      
      2. That she comply with all directions for random urine testing and drug analysis, as directed by the Probation and Parole Service or any other health professional with whom she comes into contact.  
      
     
     
      
      3. That she notify the Probation and Parole Service if she becomes pregnant.  
      
     
     
      
      4. That she participates in any ongoing psychological and psychiatric counselling as may be directed.  
      
    I find special circumstances. 82 I direct a copy of these remarks be forwarded to the Newcastle office of the Probation and Parole Service and the Newcastle Office of the Department of Community Services, showing the name of the offender.

     Judgment 
    [1] This morning I have heard argument about the form and capacity of imputations pleaded as arising from a radio broadcast and made orders as set out at the end of this judgment. As I had a number of matters in the list, and both counsel have to get away to other hearings, the parties kindly agreed that I could hand down my reasons for decision later today.[2] The plaintiff by way of Amended Statement of Claim filed on 19 August 2009 brings proceedings for defamation under the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) against the defendant for a radio broadcast by Radio 2SM on 30 June 2009. The plaintiff pleaded that the following imputations were conveyed by the defendant: 
     
     “(a)The Plaintiff overrides the Quirindi Councillors (paragraphs 21-24). 
      
      
     (b) The Plaintiff will not listen to ratepayers (34). 
      
      
     (c) The Plaintiff approves developments without the Councillors having a say (24-26,36). 
      
      
     (d) The Plaintiff so misconducted himself as general manager of the Council that he is being investigated (44, 66, 77). 
      
      
     (e) The Plaintiff is working hand in hand with developers (43). 
      
      
     (f) The Plaintiff knocked back developments on Gunnedah Road so as to facilitate the purchase of the proposed developments by another developer who was an old ex Councillor (48). 
      
      
     (g) The Plaintiff allowed a development to go through within a matter of a week in order to assist a developer with whom he was working hand in hand (43, 48, 54). 
      
      
     (h) The Plaintiff is being investigated about how he funds his developments (65-66). 
      
      
     (i) The Plaintiff bought a block of land and then had persons build houses on them without Council permission (54). 
      
      
     (j) The Plaintiff thwarts the entrepreneurial initiatives of developers with whom he is not working hand in hand (43-50). 
      
      
     (k) The Plaintiff has acquired wealth through the corrupt use of his power as General Manager of Quirindi Council (whole broadcast). 
      
      
     (l) The Plaintiff is a low life, that is to say he is one of the more seedy elements of society and a despicable person (68). 
      
      
     (m) The Plaintiff is corrupt (whole broadcast). 
      
      
     (n) The Plaintiff is dishonest (whole broadcast). 
      
      
     (o) The Plaintiff goes behind the Council’s back and approves and builds developments for his own financial gain (whole broadcast). 
      
      
     (p) The Plaintiff does not act in the best interests of the Quirindi community (whole broadcast). 
      
      
     (q) As General Manager the Plaintiff may not have done the best thing from a business point of view (72). 
      
      
     (r) The Plaintiff as General Manager had a big conflict of interest (77). 
      
      
     (s) The Plaintiff should be reported to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) (77, 87). 
      
      
     (t) The Plaintiff’s ownership of houses as General Manager is questionable (121-124). 
      
      
     (u) The Plaintiff covers his tracks in his developments because he has something to hide (85, 87-90, 97).” 
    [3] The defendant’s application to strike out portions of the Amended Statement of Claim, and also to challenge the form and capacity of the imputations pleaded, is one commonly made in the Defamation List. Objections to the imputations were not provided until 4 September 2009. As a result of that letter, Mr Evatt advised before argument commenced that he would abandon seven of the imputations ((a), (b), (c), (i), (j), (q) and (u), and in the course of argument, when new matters were raised, he promptly agreed to amend.[4] It used to be the case in Defamation List matters that the “media firms’ specializing in defamation law would write letters advising of objections so that amendments could be made. The solicitors for the defendants in these proceedings are not only highly regarded as one of Australia’s best “media firms” but have been well-known in the past as adopting this sensible practice. It is a practice I would like to see used more often in the Defamation List in future.[5] The concessions Mr Evatt made in argument were: 
     
     (a) in accordance with the requirement for imputations about being investigated to nominate the investigator ( 
     Sergi v Australian Broadcasting Commission  
     [1983] 2 NSWLR 669 at 671 per Hutley JA), to amend imputations (d) and (h) accordingly; 
      
      
     (b) in accordance with appellate decisions concerning the inadvisability of using the word “corrupt”, to withdraw “corrupt” from imputation (k) and withdraw imputation (m); 
      
      
     (c) to revise the wording of imputations (l) and (o); and 
      
      
     (d) to change the claim in paragraphs 8 and 9 from republication to publication. 
    The issues now before me[6] I now turn to a consideration of the remaining imputations.[7] The defendant submits the following remaining imputations are not defamatory: imputations (e), (f), (p) and (s).[8] The defendant submits the following remaining imputations are not capable of arising: imputations (g), (h), (m), (p) (s) and (t) and.[9] The defendant submits the following imputations are defective in form:  
     
     (a) Imputation (d) is defective because the phrase “so misconducted himself” is impermissible. 
      
      
     (b) The following imputations contain ambiguity by reason of the choice of language: imputations (j) “thwarts”, imputation (n) “dishonest” and imputation (t) “questionable”. 
      
      
     (c) Imputation (r) is defective in form in that the conflict of interest is not identified. 
    Defamatory meaning[10] Defamatory meaning is a matter which it is appropriate for the jury to determine in relation to each of these imputations challenged. Imputations that the plaintiff “does not act in the best interests of the Quirindi community”, or “may not have done the best thing from a business point of view” in his capacity as General Manager, are matters which will fall within the province of the jury as the finders of fact.[11] Each of the remaining imputations set out above is capable of describing an act or condition capable of satisfying the test that ordinary right-thinking members of the community would think less of a person if such conduct was imputed to him or her.[12] Judges must be careful not to trespass into the domain of the jury in this regard. Whether or not these imputations are defamatory is a matter for members of the jury, who know so much better what community standards are.[13] I reject the challenges to defamatory meaning raised by the defendant in relation to each of the imputations challenged.Capacity[14] The relevant principles are stated by Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Mason P and Handley JA agreed) in Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 at 164 – 67 as summarised and confirmed by Tobias JA (with whom Sheller JA and Young CJ in Eq agreed) in Griffith v John Fairfax Publications [2004] NSWCA 300 at [19 – 20]. These principles were, as the Court of Appeal noted in Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 6 at [13] per McColl JA, revisited by the High Court in Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 79 ALJR 1716 by Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ, a decision of considerable utility given the change in the status of imputations in New South Wales from the cause of action to a particular of the cause of action by reason of the new regime set up by the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), the Act which governs these proceedings.[15] The Court of Appeal in Ahmed notes (at [17]) that requests to strike out imputations should be approached with “great caution” and that if reasonable minds might possibly differ, that would be a strong, indeed perhaps insuperable, reason for not exercising the discretion to strike out.[16] That is very much the case here. The matter complained of is a “talkback radio” style broadcasts, and the capacity of the ordinary reasonable listener for loose thinking when listening to such an evanescent medium as radio has been the subject of comment in a number of the above decisions.[17] In each of the objections raised, Mr Dawson, counsel for the defendant, urged upon me a “careful” reading of the text of the matter complained of to look for the meaning he urges upon me. However, that is precisely what I must not do. The ordinary reasonable listener is not listening with this high degree of attention, and does not have a transcript which can be pored over. Imputation (g)[18] Imputation (g) arises from paragraphs 43, 48 and 54. The compere asks: “Is [the plaintiff] working hand in hand with anyone with the developments?” to which the caller replies “Yes he is and that’s the problem.” He goes on to talk about the ex-councillor at paragraph 48 and there is a further reference at paragraph 54.[19] Mr Dawson submits that this imputation can only be arrived at by connecting these paragraphs. However, that is just what Hunt CJ at CL in Marsden (supra) at 164-7 is explaining when his Honour points out that the ordinary reasonable reader (or listener) capable of a degree of loose thinking will “join the dots” in this fashion.[20] This imputation is capable of being conveyed and, as is the case with all the imputations discussed below, will go to the jury which the defendant in these proceedings has requisitioned.Imputation (h)[21] Imputation (h) clearly arises from paragraphs 65-68, which refer to the investigator looking into this conduct, and calling the plaintiff a “low life”.[22] This imputation is capable of being conveyed.Imputation (p)[23] The plaintiff asserts that this imputation arises from the whole broadcast.[24] The plaintiff is accused throughout the broadcast of a wide variety of actions which show he is not acting in the interests of ratepayers. This imputation is capable of being conveyed.Imputation (s)[25] The plaintiff asserts in the Amended Statement of Claim that this imputation arises from paragraphs 77 and 87.[26] The second caller effectively says that the first caller should not bother with hiring an investigator but go to ICAC. There is sufficient material in the matter complained of for this imputation to have the capacity to be conveyed.Imputation (t)[27] The plaintiff asserts in the Amended Statement of Claim that this imputation arises from paragraphs 121-124.[28] Although the real objection was to form, the defendant also challenged capacity, asserting that the matter complained of did not say in so many words that the plaintiff’s conduct was questionable. However, the point made by the callers was that if a person of lesser standing (such as, to use their example, a bikie) conducted himself in such a way, his conduct would be “questioned every day”.[29] There is sufficient material in the matter complained of for this imputation to have the capacity to be conveyed.Form[30] The defendant submitted that an imputation that the plaintiff “so misconducted himself” was bad in form because the misconduct could not be identified.[31] An imputation that a plaintiff “so conducted himself” has long been permitted (Rigby v John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (1994) A Def R 52-005). However, Mr Dawson submitted that “so misconducted himself” was different and impermissible.[32] In fact, in Armitage v Double Bay Newspapers Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, Hunt J, 26 September 1991, unreported) Hunt J preferred “so misconducted” to “so conducted”: 
     
     “Since that decision [ 
     Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation 
      (1990) 21 NSWLR 135], and following a very helpful observation made in it by Priestley JA (at 155), I have suggested (and have consistently upheld) an imputation along the following lines: “The plaintiff had so misconducted himself [or herself] as to warrant an investigation into that conduct by the Independent Commission Against Corruption.”” 
    [33] In Hodge v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 933 an imputation that the plaintiff “so misconducted himself” was permitted.[34] Mr Dawson submitted that the precise nature of the misconduct needed to be spelled out in the imputation, citing Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 137 per Gleeson CJ. In fact this decision supports the plaintiff’s contention that an imputation (e.g. “X is disgusting”) is permitted where the terms of the matter complained of (e.g. if the publication says “X is disgusting). This is such a case.[35] The objections in form to imputation (d) are rejected.[36] Mr Dawson also objected to the word “dishonest” in imputation (n). However, this is a publication of the kind which Levine J liked to call a “general smear” and one in which a general term such as “dishonest” (the meaning of which is clear from any dictionary) is not ambiguous.[37] Similarly, in relation to imputation (r), it is not necessary to identify what the conflict of interest is. If the plaintiff is accused of conflict of interest, he is entitled to rely upon that general allegation when drafting his imputations.Costs[38] The defendant was unsuccessful in relation to all the matters which were argued (as opposed to the matters Mr Evatt conceded).[39] In making an order for costs against the defendant, I am hoping to return to the days when comparatively simple complaints such as these were dealt with by solicitors’ correspondence outlining the nature of the objection.Orders(1) Grant leave to the plaintiff to add the words “by an investigator” to imputation (d) to read “The Plaintiff so misconducted himself as general manager of the Council that he is being investigated by an investigator.”(2) Grant leave to the plaintiff to add the words “by an investigator” to imputation (h) to read “The Plaintiff is being investigated about how he funds his developments by an investigator.”(3) Grant leave to the plaintiff to amend imputation (l) to delete the balance of the imputation so it reads: “The Plaintiff is a low life.”(4) Grant leave to the plaintiff to delete the word “corrupt” from imputation (k).(5) The plaintiff withdraws imputation (m).(6) Grant leave to the plaintiff to amend imputation (o) to read “The plaintiff rides roughshod with Councillors and builds developments for his own financial gain.”(7) Plaintiff to file and serve amended statement of claim in 7 days.(8) Defendant to file and serve Defence 28 days thereafter.(9) Defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs.(10) Matter stood over for further directions to Friday 13 November 2009 at 9:00am.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The offender Jodi Myree Campbell appears for sentence today on three separate offences. She had earlier pleaded guilty to each of those offences and so the sentence I will impose upon her for them will be twenty-five per cent less than it would otherwise have been. On one of those matters the offender was committed for sentence, and the other two appear on s 166 certificates. One of the matters on the 166 certificates is an offence of dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime and relates to $1,200 in cash. The other matter on the 166 certificate is as an owner and occupier she allowed her premises to be used as drug premises. In each case the maximum penalty is a relatively small period of imprisonment. 2 However, the more serious offence for which the offender is to be sentenced is one of ongoing supply of prohibited drug. It carries a much heavier maximum penalty, namely twenty years imprisonment. When I sentence her for that matter she asks that I take into account an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, possessing a prohibited drug and another offence of dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime, relating in this case to a stolen mobile telephone. These offences all arise out of the offender’s activities as a drug supplier.3 The two matters on the 166 certificate relate to the events of 3 June 2009. Police became aware of the activities of the offender’s de facto partner. They searched the premises where the offender and her de facto partner were living. They found a large number of items relating to drug supply, including drugs themselves. When the offender arrived home she was searched also and the $1,200 in cash that I earlier referred to was discovered upon her. It is clear that the premises that Ms Campbell shared with Mr Mohamed were used for the packaging of drugs that were later to be sold. After Ms Campbell was arrested for this matter she was granted bail, somewhat remarkably. Despite the fact that she was on bail, she engaged in drug supplies on a number of other occasions.4 A controlled operation was undertaken between 15 October and 12 November 2009. On each occasion an undercover officer would contact Mr Mohamed, arrange for the sale of drugs and on the three occasions the offender would deliver those drugs to the undercover officer. The drugs were methylamphetamine. Only relatively small quantities were involved. They were appropriate for use by the purchaser rather than there being any suggestion that the drugs would be on sold. But it is precisely this sort of activity at which s 25A is directed, ongoing supplies of quantities of drugs appropriate for a single use.5 The offender was arrested, and has remained in custody from 12 November 2009. When she was arrested the stolen iPhone was discovered and she was found to be in possession of cannabis. Police then went back to the premises that the offender was living in and discovered further evidence of drug supply, including a loaded sawn-off shotgun lying on the floor in the main bedroom. 6 The offender has a criminal history involving drugs but not for drug supply. She has earlier been dealt with for offences of possession of drugs. In 2006 she was dealt with for three offences. Ultimately, it appeared on appeal to the District Court, she received a s 10 bond. She was then supervised by the Probation and Parole Service.7 The offender, this is quite clear, has an addiction to drugs. She told the Probation and Parole Service that she would average twenty to fifty cones of daily cannabis use before her arrest. She also told the Probation and Parole Service that she was in financial difficulties at the time of the offence. The fact that she was using drugs to such a high level may well have had something to do with the financial difficulties that she found herself in. She is now thirty years of age and was, until she moved in with Mr Mohamed, living with her father and her grandmother.8 Evidence was tendered this morning to indicate that the offender’s grandmother was to undergo surgery and indeed I understand that she underwent that surgery this morning. The offender’s father gave evidence that he will not be in a position to assist his mother as she convalesces. A letter from a doctor was tendered which suggests that Ms Campbell will be required to assist her grandmother for one month from the operation. There are two problems with the offender’s reliance on the circumstances relating to her grandmother. The first is that as was conceded by Mr Morris those circumstances do not demonstrate anything exceptional. The second problem is that I am satisfied that a significantly longer period in custody is required by which stage the offender’s grandmother will no longer need assistance as she convalesces.9 These were very serious offences. As I said before, it is remarkable that the offender would continue to offend in this way, even after she was granted bail. It is a significantly aggravating feature that she has abused the decision of the court to allow her her freedom to go and commit further offences. On the other hand, as Mr Morris correctly points out, the quantities involved in each case are small. The money involved was relatively low. The drugs were not actually disseminated to the community, instead they were seized by police as part of the undercover operation. The offender acted as a driver or deliverer in relation to deals organised between police and someone else, her de facto, and the offender was herself a user of drugs. They are all very much mitigating features working in the offender’s favour. But it remains the case that her criminality was substantial.10 Mr Morris relies on figures from the Judicial Commission. I have of course taken those into account but I note that the figures do not concentrate as they could have on cases similar to the one before me, in that they do not limit the sentences to those involving breaches of conditional liberty or those offenders who ask that Forms 1 be taken into account.11 A bit of attention was paid during submissions this morning to the question as to how I should treat the drug involved in this case, namely methylamphetamine. Mr Morris relied on a case of R v Cheikh [2004] NSWCCA 448 and one of R v Poon (2003) 56 NSWLR 284 to suggest that methylamphetamine was a middle range drug as opposed to heroin which is a high range drug. Mr Morris maintained that submission despite being referred to Adams v The Queen [2008] 8 CA 15 and Pham v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 25. It may well be that Mr Morris was misled by the sentencing bench book published by the Judicial Commission which continues to refer to the sentence of Cheikh, despite it being inconsistent with the later decisions of the High Court and Court of Criminal Appeal to which I have referred. Although reference in the Judicial Commission sentencing bench book is made to Adams v The Queen, it does not appear the authors have reflected upon whether there should continue to be reference to the conflicting earlier decision of Cheikh.12 I am satisfied that the correct position that I should adopt is that as explained by the High Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal in the two cases to which I have referred and that is this. The legislature by its selection of the particular quantities that apply to such things as commercial quantities, large commercial quantities, and indictable quantities, relating to each particular drug, has spoken as to the seriousness with which each particular drug should be treated. It is noteworthy that the quantities relating to the drugs methylamphetamine and amphetamine are the same as the quantities relating to the drug heroin. I am satisfied that this means that I should draw no distinction between heroin and methylamphetamine. I am satisfied that it is no longer the law that methylamphetamine should be treated as a mid range drug. It is my recommendation that the authors of the Judicial Commission bench book on sentencing are referred to the passage on which Mr Morris relied and give consideration as to whether it requires amendment.13 It is not possible to say that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. The fact that she has priors for drug use, had at the time of this offence quite a significant drug addiction and committed the ongoing supply offence whilst she was on bail, all prevent me from making a finding that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation. Mr Morris also relies on what he says was the offender demonstrating her remorse. The only matter that Mr Morris can point to in support of that assertion is a statement in the pre-sentence report: “Ms Campbell agreed with the police facts and acknowledged her responsibility in relation to her offending behaviour”. The Court of Criminal Appeal has warned sentencing judges about accepting such matters in a pre-sentence report, particularly where the offender is able to give evidence in the sentencing proceedings should he or she desire to.14 Were it not for the mitigating features to which I have earlier referred and Mr Morris appropriately relies on, the sentence I am soon to announce would have been much heavier indeed. 15 The offender was carrying on, with her partner, the business of being a drug supplier. It was not her full time occupation because she also worked at a supermarket at the same time but it is important to understand that as is the case for s25A offences, this is not some isolated incident but, as the offence is described, an “ongoing” business of supplying dangerous drugs to the community. The offender’s actions harm both the individual people who buy drugs which are delivered to them by her, and the community in general. For those reasons significant penalties are required.16 For the sentence of dealing with the proceeds of crime the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of three months to date from 12 November 2009, the day on which she was arrested. For the offence of allowing her premises to be used as drug premises the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of six months to date from 12 December 2009. For the offence of ongoing supply of drugs the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months to date from 12 March 2010 and a head sentence for that offence of three and a half years. The non-parole period will expire on 11 September 2011 which is the earliest on which the offender can be released to parole. Note: The passage in the Judicial Commission Sentencing Bench Book referred to in paragraph [11] above was changed soon after delivering these remarks on sentence

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: On 2 December 2006 at about 5pm four young men left the Bellambi Hotel, walked east along Bellambi Lane and up the ramp to the Bellambi Railway Station. They had all been drinking in the hotel and were carrying bottles, including a bottle of whisky. From the point they entered the ramp their actions on the station were caught on closed circuit television. The four were the two offenders, AW and a fourth man who appears to be called SW. At the time, AW was under 18 years of age and has been dealt with in the Children’s Court. 2 As they walked up the ramp to the station the four men appeared to have a discussion, then they walked in single file along the eastern side of the platform until they reached the entrance to a shelter where the ticket office and ticket machine is situated. MS, then 15 years old, had bought a ticket and was waiting in the shelter. He had seen the four men approaching and was a little apprehensive. He was counting money and had a $20 note in his hand. The four young men walked up to him and one of them took the money from his hand. They then went onto the western side of the platform. MS followed them and asked for his money back, but the four men mocked him. MS then left the station and walked east to Pioneer Road from where he called the police on a mobile phone. These events constituted the offence of steal from the person.3 The four young men then walked south along the platform. At the southern end of the platform a youngish woman was sitting on an upturned milk crate. The offender Carl Walton kicked the milk crate from under the woman. She stood and walked north along the platform. The offender followed her. He reached the milk crate, picked it up and threw it at her. She avoided it and continued to walk north along the platform. The offender then picked up the milk crate and threw it at her again. These events, which were also captured on closed circuit television, constitute the offence of affray to which Mr Walton pleaded guilty at the trial.4 The four men then caught a train to Corrimal. Again some, but not all, of their activities were recorded on closed circuit television. As they walked down the platform towards the exit, AW appeared to kick at the train and lost his footing. A young man with a bicycle, ZG, was following them, but when AW fell over, ZG walked around him. The four young men then walked past ZG and left the station. ZG mounted his bicycle and rode it off the platform. On his evidence, and this was not shown on the closed circuit television, he was then jostled by the four young men and placed in a headlock by Carl Walton, who then beckoned to AW. The other man stood in the middle of the road outside the station, blocking ZG’s route. ZG became apprehensive, put down his bicycle and took off his bag which he placed on the ground. AW came up to him and knocked him to the ground two or three times. Carl Walton picked up the bicycle and rode off on it. The other offenders, including Kevin Scorah, picked up his bag and removed his watch and other items from it. They also took an ipod from a pouch on ZG’s belt.5 The four men then walked east down Murray Rd. Some of their movements can be seen on the closed circuit television recording, but the actual assault is obscured. However, ZG gave evidence, as did two eyewitnesses, Gregory Moon and Dayna Bradley. ZG got to his feet and ran after the four men, or three men actually, because Carl Walton had ridden off on the bicycle. They stopped ZG, and there was a further fight. Ms Bradley gave evidence that all four young men kicked and punched the victim again, when he was lying on the road. However, her evidence was also that Carl Walton had taken the bicycle and ridden it away out of sight. This is not consistent with four men being present at the continuation of the assault, and I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that either of the offenders before me took part in that assault. ZG says he was knocked to the ground, but cannot say who caused this. As a result, ZG suffered lacerations to his face and knee, and chipped a tooth. There is no doubt, in my mind, that there was a robbery immediately ZG left the station, and what happened after that is not necessary to find that offence established.6 The offenders ran south and through the East Corrimal Public School to an area near Towradgi Creek. Scorah and AW were apprehended in this area. Carl Walton was arrested two days later, after a search warrant was executed at his parents’ home, and clothing, matching that shown on the closed circuit television recording, was found there. These events constituted the offence of robbery in company.7 The jury in Wollongong found both offenders guilty on each count and they were accordingly convicted of the offences. Mr Walton pleaded guilty to the offence of affray, and he is convicted of that offence. The offences were part of a continuing course of criminal activity, but they are quite separate from each other, and that will be reflected in the sentences that I impose. It is also quite clear that all four young men were seriously affected by alcohol at the time of the offences. Substance abuse of any kind must be taken into account by a sentencing court, but cannot be regarded as an excuse for criminal behaviour.8 What makes these offences rather more serious than would otherwise have been the case, is that they were committed in or near railway stations on a summer Saturday afternoon. The public has a right to expect to be able to travel by train without being assaulted and robbed and otherwise put in fear by drunken hooligans. The property involved in this case was not particularly valuable, however, three totally different, innocent individuals were threatened by behaviour, put in fear and, in the case of ZG, suffered quite serious physical injuries. There can be little doubt, in my view, that each victim who gave evidence, suffered psychological injury. The robbery offence was vicious and unprovoked. It is aggravated because it involved the use of gratuitous force, which could have endangered the life of the victim. ZG, himself, did not say he was kicked in the head, but an eyewitness said he was, and that is not necessary for a finding of the use of actual or threatened force, that is, the violence which is an essential element of robbery. Quite apart from the evidence of Ms Bradley, there is evidence of gratuitous use of force and reckless regard for human safety, and that is a seriously aggravating factor.9 The offence of steal from the person was not charged as an aggravated offence, but the fact that the two offenders, who appear before me, were in the company of each other and other people, is an aggravating factor, in what otherwise would not be the most serious offence of this type. There is no alternative to a sentence of fulltime imprisonment as an appropriate punishment for each of these offences.10 The was a co-offender, AW, who was dealt with in the Children’s Court because he was a juvenile at the time of these offences. There may be some reason why the prosecution did not seek to have that matter dealt with according to law, rather than in the Children’s Court, but that reason is not apparent to me, as AW appeared to be the most violent of the young men, and took a leading role. That is not to say that Carl Walton was not also deeply involved in the offence, being the person who actually took the money from MS, the person who kicked the milk crate and threw it twice at the victim of the affray, and the person who put ZG in a headlock. AW received a bond. Unless he suffers from some sort of intellectual impairment, it seems to me that this penalty was manifestly inadequate, even for a juvenile.11 There is a considerable body of authority that suggests that, where one offender is a juvenile and the co-offenders are adults, parity of punishment is less important because different considerations apply to the sentencing of a juvenile. See Ho, an unreported decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 28 February 1997. It is difficult to imagine a case where that principle would apply more strongly than in the case before me. Many of the cases, to which I was referred, concern situations where the Children’s Court imposed a heavier penalty than the adult court. They also refer to the need for the Children’s Court to place greater emphasis on rehabilitation. In this case, I have determined that the sentence imposed on AW should be disregarded for the purpose of sentencing these two offenders.12 Mr Scorah is 28 years old. He has a partner and a child. His parents moved to Queensland some years ago. His mother came from Queensland to support him in court. Ms Coburn, from the St Vincent De Paul Society, also gave evidence on his behalf. She is the manager of a youth refuge, where Mr Scorah has stayed on occasions, and she has remained in contact with him. She has provided support and generally befriended him. Her evidence was largely hearsay, and the offender did not give evidence himself. The most significant part of Ms Coburn’s evidence is her statement that Mr Scorah has acknowledged that he has a problem with alcohol. 13 Mr Scorah’s case was that he was not involved in any joint criminal activity, and he does not take responsibility for the offences. This may well be because he has little memory of the offences, even though he has seen in court, if not elsewhere, video tapes which clearly show that he was involved, with the three other young men, in the commission of the two offences of which the jury found him guilty. It is important that he comes to terms with the offences and accepts responsibility for them. 14 Mr Scorah has a criminal record dating back to 2000, and he has served a short term of imprisonment for stealing property in a dwelling house and dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage. Most of his record consists of property offences, and there are no offences of serious violence on his record. Ms Coburn describes him in the following terms and I quote: 
     
      
      “Kevin is very much alone and tends to isolate from others and finds forming healthy relationships with others at times difficult. Over the past years alcohol dependency has been raised on many occasions with Kevin, unfortunately he has never conceded having a problem with this until now. Alcohol has been responsible for several things over the years.” 
      
    15 Ms Coburn goes on to say that, for the first time, Mr Scorah accepts that he does now have a problem with alcohol. This is an important step in addressing his problems with alcohol. He will need support and assistance in addressing this problem when he is released from custody. This is sufficient for me to find that special circumstances apply in his case. 16 Mr Scorah was on a bond to be of good behaviour at the time of these offences. He has spent just on six months in custody, and, of that time that he spent in custody since the end of 2006, when he was arrested, only five days relate to another matter. I propose to set a commencing date for his sentence, which will take account of the whole period that he has spent in custody.17 It is also consistent with Ms Coburn’s account that Mr Scorah was not known to associate with Carl Walton, AW and the group associated with them, on an ongoing basis. It was suggested that he may have been assaulted by Carl Walton, AW and others, shortly before these incidents, but I could not be satisfied of that, even on the balance of probabilities, as there was no evidence of it. The evidence of people, who know the Waltons and the other people in the group, suggests that Mr Scorah’s involvement in these offences was not due to any ongoing involvement with these people, but primarily due to excessive use of alcohol. Mr Scorah was not shown in any of the video footage as actually using physical violence towards any victim. Witnesses did see him take property from ZG, and from his bag, and the jury was clearly and properly satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that he did take part in the joint criminal enterprise with the other offenders.18 Mr Walton is somewhat younger than Mr Scorah. He is now 23 years old and was 21 at the time of these offences. His mother gave evidence, and his counsel tendered a report from Ms Duffy, a forensic psychologist. Mr Walton, himself, did not give evidence. This reduces the weight that can be placed on the evidence, given by others, in relation to what he has told them. However, there are some matters of which I can be satisfied. Mr Walton also has a record of previous offences. None of them are matters of violence, and at the time of the trial, he was in custody, bail refused, on certain matters that will come before the District Court in Wollongong, shortly. Before that time, there was a period in 2002, when he was about 15, when he was in serious trouble in the Children’s Court. Since then, his record shows some relatively minor offences, none of which attracted a custodial sentence, until earlier this year, when he was sentenced to a short term of imprisonment for passing a valueless cheque. He has been in custody, other than on that sentence, for a total of three and a half months. Nevertheless, his role in these offences was significant. In relation to the affray, he was the only offender.19 Mr Walton grew up in the Wollongong area with his parents, an older sister and a younger brother. His mother gave evidence that the family relationships are strong. Carl Walton did well at primary school, but in Year 9 began to have difficulty at school, and left. He attended TAFE for some time, but then left and got a job. He has never had any difficulty finding employment, and in evidence there were two references from his employer, the manager of a cement rendering company. They said that he is a good worker and would always find employment in that work. There is also evidence that he was a very good rugby league player, and enjoyed team sport. I have already referred to his experiences in 2002 at the Children’s Court.20 Also, when he was about 15, he formed a relationship with a woman who is about a year younger. According to Mr Walton’s mother, this girl had an unhappy home life. She came to live with the Walton family for some years, and Mr Walton’s mother supported her while she finished school. She and Mr Walton have a child, who is now three. On two occasions, the mother has left Mr Walton and the child, and on the first occasion, the evidence is that he was severely affected by the break-up of the relationship. This is reflected, not only in the evidence given by his mother and by Ms Duffy, but it was also noticed by his employer and family friends. It appears that, at this stage, he became depressed, and began to use alcohol and ice excessively. His mother noticed a marked change in his behaviour. The evidence is that he is very close to his son, and very conscious of the responsibilities of fatherhood. However, the break-up of the relationship with the son’s mother appeared to affect him for a long time, and he was prone to substance abuse. I have already said that substance abuse is never an excuse for the commission of crimes.21 I am satisfied that Mr Walton has also, at least in part, come to terms with his substance abuse problems. This is referred to in the pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service. I consider that there are some good prospects of rehabilitation, provided that he has both family and professional support and assistance when he is released from custody, and, for that reason, I find that there are special circumstances in his case. I have already referred to the fact that, although these offences were part of a continuous course of criminal activity, they are separate offences. They cannot, for that reason, attract sentences which are totally concurrent. The principles of totality and proportionality require that there be some accumulation of the sentences. 22 The offence of stealing from the person is part of a group of offences dealt with in the same part of the Crimes Act. It is, even when committed in aggravated circumstances, less serious than the offence of robbery, because actual or threatened violence is not an element. The offence of robbery in company, however, is very serious and falls within the scope of the guidelines established by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of Henry. It must be remembered that the Henry decision applied to cases in which there was an early plea of guilty. In that case, the Court pointed to a number of factors which courts should consider, and, in this case, the victims were in each case a single person facing a group of four young men. In the case of the robbery of ZG, there was gratuitous violence and actual injury, and that, in itself, takes it slightly outside the range of sentences which the Court discussed in Henry.23 Mr Scorah is charged with only two offences, and, although he was found guilty as a principal in respect of both, his role in the two offences that he has in common with Mr Walton suggests that his part was not so significant.24 On the charge of steal from the person, Mr Scorah is sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months and a total term of two and a half years. The sentence will commence on 1 February 2008, the non-parole period will expire on 31 July 2009 and the total term on 31 July 2010.25 On the charge of robbery in company, Mr Scorah is sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and a total term of five years. The sentence will commence on 1 February 2009, the non-parole period will expire on 31 January 2012 which is the earliest date upon which he will be eligible for parole and the total term will expire on 31 January 2014.26 On the charge of steal from the person, Mr Walton is sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months and a total term of two and a half years imprisonment. That sentence will commence on 16 March 2008, the non-parole period will expire on 15 September 2009 and the total term on 15 September 2010.27 On the charge of affray, Mr Walton is sentenced to a fixed term of eight months imprisonment, commencing on 16 July 2009 and expiring on 15 March 2010. That sentence reflects a discount of two months because of the plea of guilty.28 On the charge of robbery in company, Mr Walton is sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and a total term of six years. The sentence will commence on 16 August 2009, the non-parole period will expire on 15 August 2012, which is the earliest date upon which he will be eligible for parole, and the total term will expire on 15 August 2015. 29 In relation to Carl Walton's pre-sentence custody calculation, I have allowed roughly half of the total period of seven months that he’s spent in custody, so I’ve backdated that sentence for virtually four months to take account of the pre-sentence custody, and also to take account of the principle of totality, as it applies to the sentence that he is currently serving. He must serve some time in respect of that sentence, but not the whole of it.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: On 2 July 2005 Judith Walsh was charged that she was driving with a high range prescribed concentration of alcohol.2 On 3 April 2006 she pleaded not guilty in the Local Court at Windsor. Magistrate Cullen found her guilty.3 Her defence was that she was not driving the relevant vehicle. She also argued before the Local Court that his Honour could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the breath-testing machine had accurately recorded the grams of alcohol per one hundred millilitres of blood in her veins.4 The prosecution case comprised two witnesses; one as to the circumstances of apprehension and testing, the other as to the accuracy of the reading and correctness of procedures used with the breath-testing machine.5 The defence had three witnesses; Judith Walsh, her husband Russell Walsh and Dennis Jordan, a friend of her husband.6 Judith Walsh has appealed against her conviction. The Court’s task is to rehear the matter upon the transcripts and such other exhibits as are admitted by leave to determine whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Leave has been given for road directory maps of the Wiseman's Ferry area and of the Central Coast area to be tendered.7 During the course of the appeal the sole focus has been whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the driver of the vehicle. 8 On that issue the prosecution case depends entirely upon the evidence of Senior Constable Fancy. His evidence on this aspect was that at about 4.30pm he observed a vehicle, XLT 227, being driven by the appellant along Old Northern Road, Wiseman’s Ferry. He said that it was on the incorrect side of the road and then merged to its right, by which I think he meant made a right-hand turn, into the turning bay of the main vehicular ferry. 9 He was invited by his Honour in the Court below to draw a map or a diagram, which he did. The diagram has a number of cars positioned in the left-hand lane of the road, facing north, and a vehicle coming out of that line of traffic, across what would appear to be drawn as two solid lines, travelling down the right-hand side of the road and making the right-hand turn into a turning bay. Thus explained, it does not appear to me that any complaint can be made about the fact that the vehicle was travelling on what the officer said was the incorrect side of the road. 10 At this particular point in time it would seem, on either case, that the ferries were not running and there was not likely to be traffic coming up that side of the road. Further, the diagram suggests that the street was straight.11 Senior Constable Fancy’s evidence continues that when the vehicle stopped, the appellant got from her car, walked around the back of her car and was leaning, with her right arm, on the back of her vehicle. He walked over to her and said, “Are you all right, Judy?” She said, “Yes.” He noted that, from a distance of two metres, her eyes were bloodshot and he said to her, “Have you been drinking today?” She said, “No.” He then looked inside the vehicle and noted a six-pack of VB stubbies sitting on the passenger floor area. The packet was open and a bottle of VB sitting on the console area. The appellant is recorded as saying, “That’s yesterday's beer.” The police officer said, “Have you been drinking whilst you have been driving?” The appellant said, “No.” He detected a smell of intoxicating liquor, touched the open bottle of beer and felt that the beer was warm. 12 It would appear he then determined to go to the police vehicle. He said to the appellant, “I won’t be a moment”, returned to the police vehicle and obtained an alcometer and returned to the appellant. He required her to breathe into what he said was a random breath test in accordance with the Road Transport (Safety) Act. Query whether it was so random at this point in time but, in any event, he required her to exhale air from the lungs calmly and continuously until told to stop. The appellant agreed she understood that instruction. She blew into the alcometer, which returned a positive reading, was placed under arrest for the purpose of breath analysis and was told that she was to be taken to Wiseman’s Police Station for the test. 13 The officer said to the appellant, “Would you accompany me to the police vehicle please.” The appellant said, “Can I lock up my car?” and the officer said, “Yes.” Thereafter she was taken to the police station and after some difficulties a reading of 0.205 grams of alcohol per one hundred millilitres of blood was given. That reading is now no longer, as I say, in dispute.14 The appellant’s case was this. That she lived in Blacktown but her husband lived in Gundeman, which was some thirteen kilometres from the Wiseman’s Ferry area. On the relevant date she was driving her vehicle to Wiseman’s Ferry. 15 She left home around eleven. Her evidence was that she arrived at Wiseman’s Ferry just after lunch. Both ferries (apparently two ferries run there) were out, due to debris and, as a consequence, she was not able to cross the river because of debris on both cables and the ramps. She turned around and was going to Webb’s Creek Ferry to cross over there. It would appear that she did cross at Webb’s Creek and was then to do a loop to go to Gundeman through St Albans but got lost. 16 For reasons not quite explained she chose to have a beer at The Settler’s Arms, had the one and continued on her journey. She left the pub at which she was drinking, The Settler’s Arms, about 1.30pm and arrived at the Wiseman’s Ferry just after 2 o’clock. At that time apparently her husband started his shift. She noted a backlog of vehicles there and she went down the wrong side of the road and parked in the parking bay. 17 Having parked in the parking bay she walked up to the ferry to see her husband and Dennis Jordan, inquired of them how long the ferries were going to be out and said to her husband that if it was going to take too long she would go to the pub for a little while and that Mr Walsh or Jordan could drive her vehicle home because they had only travelled to work in the one car. 18 She walked ten to fifteen minutes to the Wiseman’s Ferry Hotel with a view, as I have understood her evidence, that some of the locals would be able to offer her a lift. Whether the lift was back to Blacktown or back to Gundeman was not made clear, to me at least, in the evidence. Whether there were specific people that she was going to ask or whether she was taking potluck, also was not made clear in the evidence to me. 19 She remained, on her account, at the hotel until twenty past four or so and then walked back down from the hotel to the ferries. Again, her purpose in so doing has not been explained. But she noticed her husband working on the ferry and that Dennis Jordan was near a gate in the area where her motor vehicle had been parked. 20 The motor vehicle had been moved since she had last parked it because it would seem, on the defence account, the debris that was in the river was being dumped in the car park area by front-end loaders. The vehicle had been moved by her husband. As she was talking to Jordan, he being on the inside of the fence and she being on the outside of the fence near this gate, she noticed in the corner of her eye Senior Constable Fancy walking her way. He asked to speak to her and Jordan walked away. 21 The officer asked if she had been drinking. She said, “Yes, but I wasn’t driving.” He said to me that he had seen her [drive] and that she was under arrest and asked for her licence. She gave him her licence and he breath-tested her there, without returning to the police vehicle. 22 Jordan, it would seem, when he left walked down the ramp to the ferry. That was the main ferry. 23 The appellant’s case was that Fancy asked how was she, and where was she going. The appellant had said, “Well I’m not going anywhere cause the ferries are out.” He asked whether she had been drinking and she said, “Yes, but I’m not driving.” He said that he had seen her, seemed quite agitated. She was not going to argue with him. He breath-tested her and told her she was under arrest, took her to the police station. Before she went the police station she agrees with his evidence that she asked if she could lock the car up and he said, “No”. What she asked, was whether she could get her stuff out of the car. But she agrees that she did lock the car and took the keys with her.24 The accounts given by her witnesses, while they may not have had the detail of the account given by the appellant, were generally in tune with the account given by the appellant. 25 This is a case, as I said to the Crown, where the only evidence of criminal acts against the appellant comes from the one witness. It seems to me that I am required to scrutinise his evidence with care. 26 That task has been made the easier for me in this sense that Mr Weller, who appears for the appellant, has taken me through the police officer’s evidence chapter and verse. There are certainly blemishes in the officer’s evidence. It is the significance of the blemishes that I suppose needs to be analysed.27 The most significant of the blemishes, it appears to me, is a proposition given by the officer that all of the conversation he had with the appellant was taken down in writing in his notebook. It is not established in the evidence directly whether the note was contemporaneous or subsequent, but looking at the note, my own view is that it was not contemporaneous but rather a record made shortly after the episode. 28 The use of the past tense is what persuades me that is so. On page 44, “Also noticed open packet of six-pack.” and just below that, “Obtained alco number 5256.” Immediately above that, “Looked inside vehicle.” What is clear is that some of the conversation referred to in his statement, which was made a month later, does not appear in that contemporaneous note. Particularly this exchange, “Have you been drinking today?” She said, “No.” [however see next paragraph] That conversation is said to have occurred after he walked over to the appellant and said to her, “Are you all right?”29 His statement was tendered by the defence and is, of course, evidence of the facts contained in it. Well one of the facts contained in it is the name of the appellant, her address and some other details, which would appear to be date of birth. I do not know what “29/12/07” means, but then “Seen driving motor vehicle - with a registration number - not on Old Windsor Road.” There is evidence of conversation, including “Asked if she had been drinking today? No.” [page 43 and 44], which I thought was a conversation that we did not see.30 The submission was that the evidence was not acceptable because Senior Constable Fancy was less than a satisfactory witness. He was apparently unable to recall a man by the name of Bruno Jordan, and that he continually responded to cross-examination questions with “I don’t recall that.” It was submitted that they were examples of him being evasive. 31 My own view of that is that the propositions were being put to him by a solicitor of the Supreme Court. He entertained the possibility that those propositions could have been the fact, said he did not recall. It must be remembered that the lapse of time between the hearing before the magistrate and the event was some nine months. It is not likely in those circumstances that he would have remembered a great deal of detail.32 The appellant gave, as I say, an account which Mr Weller has conceded can only make sense if one accepts the proposition that Senior Constable Fancy was “loading-up” the appellant with a drink-driving charge, in circumstances where he approached her with an alco test already in his hand and, on the defence case, in circumstances where she had not been driving and was engaged in a conversation with what I might call an independent witness, and while her husband was near at hand and within eyesight. That proposition seems incredible to me. 33 If that were all then it may well be that, particularly given past history of at least New South Wales detectives, I may have been persuaded to hold a reasonable doubt.34 But there are other problems with the defence case that make it incredible. The appellant had arranged for her husband to drive her vehicle home, or if not him then the man Jordan. Yet when in the process of being arrested she locks her vehicle and takes the key with her, demonstrating what I would have thought was appropriate security consciousness. But in the circumstances of this case absolutely contrary to all of the other evidence, because the other evidence from her and, indeed, from her husband that she left the key in the motor vehicle. The husband said she had left it in the ignition and left it in the ignition, in circumstances where, it would seem, he was going to be at times on one side of the river, the car on the other, and people not far from the hotel about the place. 35 She left the Wiseman’s Ferry Hotel, having drunk there for two hours, in circumstances unexplained and inconsistent with her initial purpose in going there, which was to drink for a while and then get a local to take her wherever it was she was going. I do not know the area very well and I certainly do not know whether Gundeman is on the main road out of Wiseman’s Ferry, but what the evidence discloses is it is thirteen kilometres away. There is no indication of her knowledge of anybody who was going to that place. The other place that she may have gone to was Blacktown and there is even less indication of anybody that she knew likely to be going there. That suggests to me that the story or the account is incredible. A third matter of some difficulty for the defence case is that the witness Jordan hears three things of significance. The first is the accusation by Senior Constable Fancy that the appellant had been driving the vehicle, at least in the sense of being questioned about it, a demand being made upon her to blow into a breathalyser unit of some kind and her arrest for having failed the roadside breath test. He appears to do nothing to protest in respect of the appellant who is, as I say, the wife of his “good mate”. 36 The appellant also was cross-examined as to the professionalism and courteousness of Senior Constable Fancy. But for his unfairly targeting her initially, her position is that he was always professional and always courteous.37 The motive, it is said, for this “load-up” was an issue of domestic violence said to have occurred between the appellant and her husband and reported to the police officer in a hearsay report some time later. He was motivated, it was said, to say something to the effect that he did not want her in the town, meaning Wiseman’s Ferry. He denied that. It was said that the officer had a history with each of the three witnesses in the defence case but even so, if one takes an overall view of policemen’s rounds, it is likely that the officer, given the incident of domestic violence in the community, would have on many occasions dealt with many other people for domestic violence. I cannot for the life of me accept that as a proposition to motivate an officer to behaviour of this level of corruption.38 Notwithstanding that there are three witnesses who give sworn evidence contrary to the evidence of the officer I am of a view that their evidence is evidence that has come about as a result of conversations between themselves as to the incident. There is evidence, which I accept from Jordan that conversations did occur. It would not be surprising if such conversations had occurred. It is no part of my task to determine whether the appellant and her witnesses were deliberately lying. My task is solely to focus on whether the Crown has proved the guilt of the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.39 I reject the appellant’s account. I reject the account of her witnesses. 40 That leaves me then to examine the Crown evidence and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the officer did observe the appellant driving at about 4.30pm on the relevant afternoon.41 One final matter which I should have mentioned as I reviewed the facts was that the description of the manoeuvre undertaken by the appellant of leaving a line of traffic and driving down what he called the wrong side of the road is a manoeuvre that the appellant concedes in her own evidence did occur, although she puts that incident as occurring two hours earlier.42 In all the circumstances I find the Crown case proved and I find it proved beyond a reasonable doubt.The Court then went on to confirm the orders made by the Learned Magistrate in the Local Court.

   SENTENCE1 The offender, Darren Andrew Cole, appears for sentence after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to an offence of supplying a prohibited drug, the drug in question was amphetamine in the form of Ice. 2 The offender came to the attention of police due to his manner of driving. He sped past police and so they decided to stop him. He, through his manner of driving, indicated that he was not going to stop and it was not until he collided with another car that police were able to arrest him. Police then searched the vehicle driven by the offender. They discovered both drugs and indicia of drug supply. They found two resealable bags containing a crystal substance, thirty-three unused plastic resealable bags, a set of palm scales. They also found on the offender a substantial amount of money, $4,290. 3 The offender has pleaded guilty to an offence of goods in custody in relation to that money and has asked that I take it into account when sentencing him for the drug supply matter.4 The crystal substance proved to be Ice, one quantity of 2.86 grams and the other 2.43 grams. 5 The offender was interviewed by police in relation to these matters and made full admissions as to his drug dealing activities. 6 Police also found a digital camera and upon reviewing the photos stored in it they found photos that the offender had, helpfully, kept showing him with large sums of money. The offender told police that the amount of money he had on him came from supply which he had conducted earlier that evening. He said that he had sold Ice on five occasions in the Five Dock, Leichhardt and Surrey Hills areas. The offence for which he is to be sentenced relates to those five acts of supply. The offender also told police that he had been supplying drugs on other occasions. He said that he had been doing this for about eight weeks and that he would have supplied Ice on more than ten occasions but less than thirty. Of course he is not to be sentenced for the acts of supply other than those on 30 August, but the relevance of what he told police is, firstly, that he came clean with them and, secondly, that he is not to be sentenced as though his activities on 30 August were isolated. 7 He was trafficking to a substantial degree. The authorities are clear: unless it is an exceptional case, full-time custody must follow trafficking to a substantial degree.8 The offender was born in Taree. His mother is of Indonesian background. He speaks fluent Indonesian and English. He had an unremarkable childhood before joining the navy. He performed the role of a medic whilst in the navy, and because of his skills in that area and his fluency in Indonesian, he played a very important role in the Australian humanitarian efforts after the tsunami on Boxing Day 2005. He was on the Kanimbula and, as will be well remembered, a helicopter from that ship crashed during the humanitarian efforts killing a number of service personnel. 9 The offender gave evidence about that circumstance in his evidence today. He was in fact due to travel on the helicopter which crashed until about ten minutes before it departed. He knew all of the nine people killed; four aircrew who were regularly based on the Kanimbula and five medics. He assisted in caring for two of those who were injured who were received onto the Kanimbula; one of those was in fact his cabin mate. The following day he assisted in the retrieval of the bodies of his nine shipmates. 10 It is difficult for anyone sitting in a comfortable courthouse to imagine the effect of such tragedy upon the offender. A report from Dr Allnutt goes a long way to putting in psychiatric terms the consequences for the offender after he returned from Aceh. 11 The offender is entitled to be very proud of what he did for his country, and people affected by the tsunami and its aftermath. His involvement in the relief effort following the tsunami and his involvement in the consequences of the helicopter crash had a significant effect upon him. 12 Upon his return to Australia he thought that he had a chip on his shoulder. He was dissatisfied with life in the navy and felt that he was not being supported by them and so he left. He worked for a while but then suffered a significant assault at work, the assault left him with a fractured skull. Whilst unable to work he was at home a lot and in those circumstances he began to consume drugs. That led to him becoming a drug supplier. 13 But this is not a case which is commonly put before the court where the offender supplies drugs merely to fund his own habit, in this case the offender was motivated, at least partly, by the money that could be made from drug supplies. Indeed, he told police this when he was arrested. The police said, “Can you tell me why you conduct this type of business?” And he said, “For reasons I guess to satisfy one’s needs” and “just for the profit that’s available out of a sale.”  It is clear that the offender went into this drug supply operation in order to make money. That is a significant circumstance in deciding the appropriate sentence to impose upon him.14 Also relevant is the fact that the offender was on a bond at the time he committed this offence, having been dealt with in the Local Court for a driving matter. He has other driving matters on his criminal history, although there is nothing of this seriousness. When referring to driving matters, it is also not irrelevant that he refused to stop when police attempted to stop him, although I do note that he is to be dealt with for offences committed whilst driving, and so I will not increase the sentence because of that circumstance. 15 The offender’s prior good character of course is qualified by those driving offences which he earlier committed, the fact that this is not an isolated act of supply and that he was a drug user for some time. I am satisfied however that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and that he is unlikely to re-offend. Indeed, he will be personally deterred from offending in the future because of the sentence I will shortly impose upon him. The offender, consistent with his attitude towards the police, (that is, as I described he came clean with them), pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so I will discount the sentence I would have otherwise imposed by twenty-five per cent to reflect that circumstance.16 The drug Ice is a particular dangerous one. It causes many problems to both individuals and society generally. It is a comparatively cheap form of drug which notoriously leads to psychotic episodes on the part of some drug users, and in common with almost all drugs leads to many other offences being committed, as drug users commit offences in order to fund their activities. This offence is a very serious one carrying with it the maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment.17 I am satisfied the offender is remorseful and I am satisfied also that to a large extent he is no longer the person he was when he committed these offences. Mr Marshall says this is an exceptional case such as would justify a sentence other than full-time custody. I take it from that that Mr Marshall is accepting that the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree, a finding which I have already made. I am not however satisfied that this is an exceptional case justifying anything other than full-time imprisonment. Many people begin to take drugs at a time of emotional trauma such as that suffered by the offender, but that scarcely explains the decision made by the offender to become a drug dealer, a decision prompted, at least in part, by the money which was available to be made. He told the police that he was undergoing some financial stress at the time, but that is again no justification at all for having decided to commit a particularly serious offence, a particularly dangerous one as well. This is not an exceptional case at all. It is unfortunately all too common where someone suffers emotional trauma and begins using drugs and then begins to sell them. What is unusual perhaps is that the offender in this case went beyond simply funding his own drug habit and was motivated by a desire to make money. Indeed, he seems to have been quite successful at it as the amount of money found in his possession would demonstrate. 18 I have found special circumstances in this case. It is the offender’s first time in custody. He is still suffering the effects of the post traumatic stress disorder to which I have referred, and he, thus the community, will benefit from a longer period of supervision on parole. 19 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of twelve months to date from today, 1 May 2008. I set a head sentence of two years and three months. The offender will thus be released to parole on 30 April 2009.20 Any other matter, Mr Crown?21 JOHNSTONE: Your Honour, I seek the forfeiture of the cash of $4,290 and also the destruction of the drugs.22 HIS HONOUR: I make both of those orders.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: I have before me an application brought by way of notice of motion that an indictment be permanently stayed. The indictment alleges a number of offences committed by the applicant, who I will hereinafter refer to as the accused, in Nepal. The accused being prosecuted for offences, allegedly committed outside Australia, under part IIIA of the Commonwealth Crimes Act.  However, he has already been dealt with by a court in Nepal for some misconduct. The application is made that the proceedings on the indictment should be permanently stayed because of section 50FC of the Crimes Act, which says: 
     
      
      “If a person has been convicted or acquitted in a country outside Australia of an offence against the law of that country in respect of any conduct, the person cannot be convicted of an offence against this part in respect of that conduct.” 
      
    I accept that the words “in respect of” have a wide meaning. 2 The material before me includes what is apparently the judgment of the Nepalese court which dealt with a case presented against the accused. Also exhibited to me are a number of other documents which have been translated from Nepalese, but I have had some difficulty in identifying whether those documents form part of the court record, and so I have had some difficulty in identifying with some precision the actual findings made by the Nepalese Court. At one stage I considered that it was important to be able to identify which documents were part of the court record, but a comparison of the contents of the other Nepalese documents and the charges on the indictment has led me to conclude that it does not really matter. 3 The position advanced by the Crown is that section 50FC should be interpreted in such a way that in deciding whether a person has been convicted of any conduct, it is important to look at the elements of the offence. Mr Jeffreys, who appears on behalf of the accused, says however that the words in section 50FC are intended to have a much wider meaning. He says that conduct, for example, included in an allegation of an offence is covered by section 50FC, even if the elements of that offence do not require that any consideration is given to whether that conduct occurred or not. 4 The starting point of course is the words of section 50FC themselves. It is important to emphasise the relationship between the word “convicted” and the words “in respect of any conduct”. To my mind this can only mean that the conduct to be considered is the conduct which led to the conviction, that is the elements of the offence. 5 The fact that, as part of the allegation made against a person, various aspects of that person’s conduct are referred to, does not mean that all aspects of the person’s conduct are encompassed by the concept which is to be found in section 50FC. If the accused’s argument is correct and a person in Nepal used a knife to threaten a child to obtain the child’s compliance with a sexual act and then was dealt with in Nepal for an offence involving the possession of the knife, the fact that the circumstances of the allegation referred to the sexual act would mean that the accused could not be convicted or tried in Australia in relation to the sexual assault of the child. 6 It cannot be the case that if a person is dealt with in a foreign country for one aspect of their conduct, the child sex tourism parts of the Crimes Act cease to have any effect merely if part of the allegation made against the accused in the foreign country includes reference to an offence under that part of the Crimes Act. 7 A person cannot be convicted of conduct which is not an element of the offence with which the person was charged. Mr Jeffreys’ submissions emphasised the words “in respect of any conduct” and “in respect of that conduct”, but did not sufficiently address the requirement that the person be convicted or acquitted in a relevant case, which is not this one, in respect of that conduct.8 The accused presented an example of a plea bargain in Florida, saying that courts of this country should give respect to the prosecutorial decisions of other countries. A lot depends on what is meant by “respect”. This court cannot be bound by such decisions, in particular because prosecutorial decisions in foreign countries will be based upon evidence available to the prosecutor in that country, and there may be different and stronger evidence available in Australia. To accept the accused’s argument would be to elevate decisions made in the course of a prosecution in one country to bar further prosecution in this country, even where the proceedings in this country are in respect of conduct for which the accused has not been convicted. 9 It is not necessary to look at any extrinsic aids to the construction of the section. In fact, because I am satisfied that section 50FC is clear, it may even not be permissible to do so. Section 50FC, I am satisfied, can have only one meaning, that is, the meaning I gave to the section earlier, which is that where a person is convicted in respect of conduct, that requires attention to the elements of the offence. I repeat, a person cannot be convicted of conduct which is not an element of the offence with which that person has been charged.10 Mr Jeffreys did point to other ways that Parliament could have expressed itself, referring, for example, to section 4C of the Crimes Act. He said that Parliament could have perhaps expressed itself better. I do not necessarily agree with that statement, but even if it is true, that does not mean that where the words of the section are clear, some alternative meaning should be given to them. 11 Even if I am wrong, there are some counts on the indictment where, even accepting Mr Jeffreys’ submission that his client was convicted in respect of conduct contained in the allegations made by the complainants, (that is, rather than conduct which is an element of the offences), there are many counts on the indictment where a close examination of the material which may have been before the court, and which seem to have been part of the Nepalese prosecution process, fail to reveal any conduct covered by those counts on the indictment. For example, count 1 alleges that the complainant gave the accused a massage. A similar allegation is made in count 5. But there is nothing in any of the material I have read which suggests that it was ever alleged, let alone found by the court, that the complainant in count 1 or the complainant in count 5 either massaged the appellant or was asked to massage him.12 Similarly, in relation to count 11, there is no allegation that the appellant attempted to have sex with AG in any of the Nepalese material, nor, turning to count 12, is there any allegation that he attempted to hug the same person. Mr Jeffreys was therefore forced to fall back to an alternative proposition, which was that the conduct that section 50FC referred to was any conduct which occurred at about the same time as conduct which led to a persons conviction. It is really only necessary to state that proposition for it to be rejected.13 I can illustrate the reason that courts of this country would insist on looking at the elements of offence to see what is covered by s 50FC by considering that aspect of the case which concerns the question of whether the accused played with the penis of any of the complainants. Counts 9, 10 and 15 make allegations that the accused attempted to touch the genitals of a named person. I will pass over for the moment the problems between any statement that the accused played with the penis of a complainant when compared with allegation that he attempted to do so and look at the question of what finding did the court in Nepal make as to whether the accused did or not play with the penis of any complainant. I asked Mr Jeffreys to identify that part of the Nepalese judgment which best identified a finding that the appellant did so, whether or not it made that finding because it had to because it was an element of the offence. Mr Jeffrey was unable to do so. There is no finding in the judgment of the Nepalese court that the accused played with the penis of any complainant and the most likely reason is that whether or not he did act in that way it was not an element of any offence with which the Nepalese court was dealing.14 Some allegations on the indictment refer to the accused’s taking indecent photographs and watching pornographic movies. This raises a very interesting issue which concerns how I identify the elements of the offence of which the accused was convicted in Nepal. The section under which he was found guilty is set out in the material. It is to be found in s 2(C1) of a Nepalese Act entitled Some Public (Crime and Punishment) Act 1970. The section reads as follows: 
     
      
      “Some public crime that must not be permitted: no-one should do the following particulars: -  
       
      … 
       
      (C1) To print vulgar material by word or a picture that indicates the sense of vulgarity or to publish vulgar language in word or publish or sell and distribute such vulgar publications in the public places apart from the purpose of the public health or health science”. 
      
    15 The Crown says that the elements of that offence are to be identified in the words of the section themselves and that conduct alleged in, say for example, count 2 on the indictment is not covered by those elements. Thus, the Crown says, section 50FC does not apply. 16 I have already indicated that to identify the nature of the conduct covered by section 50FC you have to look at the elements, and if that was the extent of the material before me I would find in favour of the Crown. Taking indecent photographs of a person and watching pornographic movies with them does not appear to amount to printing vulgar material or printing a picture that indicates a sense of vulgarity, or publishing vulgar language, or anything else that is covered by the particular section of the Some Public (Crime and Punishment) Act 1970. But, there is an indication in the judgment of the Nepalese court which indicates that the elements of the offence go beyond the simple words of that section.17 As far as I can identify the structure of the Nepalese judgment it begins with a summary of the allegations made by the prosecution. Included in that is this statement:  
     
      
      “Prigge, Geoffrey John, himself committed some public crime showing indecent films and taking naked photos of the complainant which is prohibited by punishment (C) and (C1) of s 2 of Some Public (Crime and Punishment) Act 2027.” 
      
    18 I, it may not be a surprise to learn, am not an expert in Nepalese law. But there is a statement at law, probably advanced by the prosecution which suggests that by showing indecent films and taking naked photos of the complainant a person does commit an offence under those sections of the Some Public (Crime and Punishment) Act.19 It’s not apparent from looking at the words of the section how that can be the case. And yet the statement of law is made, not apparently challenged, nor is it criticised or disagreed with in anything that later follows in the document. The precise finding of the court does not help because the precise finding does not precisely identify what conduct is found to have contravened the section.20 When I raised this with Mr Roser SC who appeared for the prosecution in this court he asked me to confine myself to the words of the section. That has some attraction. But it must be remembered that sometimes in New South Wales legislation words are given an extended meaning. The definition of cattle for example in section 4 of the Crimes Act includes horses, cows, sheep, pigs, goats, deer, alpacas, llamas, camels and even dromedaries. If one were to look at a section in the Crimes Act of New South Wales which says, “It is an offence to steal some cattle,” one would have to look beyond the words of the actual section to identify whether a dromedary rustler is committing an offence against that section. How do I know that there is not in some other part of Nepalese law some provision which gives a wider meaning to the words of the section that is apparent at first blush? Mr Roser says, that I have exhibited before me the entirety of the particular Act. But that is just one of what must be a number of Nepalese Acts. There is no evidence to suggest that the words have not been given an extended meaning somewhere else. 21 There is the problem of translation also. What I have been dealing with is the English translation of Nepalese documents. Is it possible perhaps that there is some subtlety of language which can be used to explain how in the judgment of the Nepalese Court, it can be suggested that showing indecent films and taking naked photos of the complainant was prohibited by section 2 of Some Public (Crime and Punishment) Act 1970. 22 The statement in the judgment, albeit perhaps as part of the Nepalese prosecution’s case in the judgment is according to the, Commonwealth DPP wrong. I am not prepared to find that that is the case. I accept immediately that it is not apparent how by looking only at the words of the Some Public (Crime and Punishment) Act showing indecent films and taking naked photos of the complainants can amount to an offence against that Act. But unless I am prepared to find that that aspect of the judgment represents an incorrect statement of the law then I must work on the basis that, for reasons which might relate to some other part of Nepalese law or which might relate to language or which might relate to some cause that I have not identified, the accused was convicted of conduct which related to the showing of indecent films and the taking of naked photos of the complainants.23 Consistent with what I have said it is apparent that the appellant is entitled to succeed in relation to some counts on the indictment but not others.24 The appellant is entitled to have stayed those counts on the indictment which relate to conduct consisting of him showing indecent films or taking naked photos of the complainants. 25 I therefore permanently stay the following counts on the indictment, count 2, count 3, count 4, count 6, count 7, count 8, count 13, count 14.

    JUDGMENT 1. Paul Anthony Tighe is appealing from the severity of sentences imposed upon him on 16 August last at the Moree Local Court. On that occasion his Honour sentenced the appellant for seven offences. There was an eighth offence and that was possess prohibited 0.6 grams of cannabis, his Honour gave a s 10A conviction.2. In respect of all other matters terms of imprisonment were imposed. They ranged from common assault, for which a nine month non-parole period and three months balance of term was imposed, and two other assaults and then four fail to appears. In respect of the four fail to appears six months fixed-term was imposed.3. All of those sentences were said to date from 16 August 2010 and expire on 15 August 2011. In respect of those sentences slightly more than a month has been served and there is a further eight to go before he would be released. There was no stay granted but it is my intention to grant s 11 bail upon conditions that I will deal with shortly.4. The fails to appear both relate to circumstances of a requirement to appear in respect of each of the assault offences and they were on two occasions when, in respect of each, the appellant failed to appear.5. The victim in both assaults was KH and she and the appellant had been in a relationship for six months. He came home on 11 March 2009 having drunk alcohol fishing, nothing wrong with that. He had consumed seven cans of Bundaberg Rum and Coke and twelve cans of full-strength beer.6. Legally there is nothing wrong with that but it would be devastating for his health and indeed my understanding is he has bad kidneys and bad liver. Well, if he has a history of drinking like that one could hardly be surprised. It is an attempt to kill himself by drowning in alcohol.7. They began to argue after twenty or thirty minutes. They had taken their argument to the main bedroom, presumably because other members of the family were nearby. The complainant was trying to calm the appellant down, saying that they should not be arguing. He used his right fist to punch her to the left side of the face. She felt instant pain and pushed him backwards onto the floor as a result. She jumped onto the bed and onto the appellant’s chest and hit him a number of times. She then left him and told him not to return.8. He did in fact return and was yelling at her from the back door. They told the appellant that they were going to call the police and indeed rang the police. The police arrived and they saw the appellant in the backyard trying to jump a fence. The appellant tried to supply police with a false name when he was arrested.9. The other offence was not unlike that if I can just find it. On this occasion, again there is alcohol involved. They were walking home from a night out at five minutes to midnight. The appellant, no doubt feeling insecure, approached his newish partner with “Do you want to fuck Jade Duncan”. Jade Duncan, as I understand it, was the former partner of KH. That must have played upon his mind because when they arrived home a few minutes later he called her a “fucking slut”.10. Again they went to their bedroom, she lay on the bed, he was standing nearby; he pulled her hair, causing her head to move from side to side in a violent motion. She pulled away from him. He punched her to the right eye. He said to her “You’re a slut. Go and have him if you want to be with him.”11. She retaliated. There was punching by her. She left the bedroom. She noticed when she looked in the mirror she had a large bump to her right eye and bruising to her head. She did not contact the police. There was also tension over the same topic earlier that morning. On 11 March he was arrested for the offence.12. A look at his record will tell anybody who knows anything about crime that much of his offending is alcohol related. I said earlier in this court that the very early First Fleeters noticed that Aboriginal men did not treat their women well in Sydney, at least in the harbour that they then were. They also noticed that the men were basically unclothed and basically walked here and there.13. As I noted this morning, those customs of being unclothed and of walking everywhere have been dropped. Aboriginal men and women do not want to live those customary ways anymore, and it is pretty clear that Aboriginal women do not want to live in this old custom of being belted by their husbands anymore.14. To say that something is an Aboriginal custom and not examine the custom is a nonsense. Aboriginal women are making it clear and abundantly clear time and time again that they are not going to put up with Aboriginal men belting the living daylights out of them when they are drunk. And the real heroes for me and for many of my fellow judges are the women who have the courage to stand up and say, notwithstanding the risk of retribution, “We are not going to put up with this anymore”. Those women are just tremendous.15. So as with many things, Aboriginal customs are going to change. If they want to go back, Aboriginal people want to go back to walking barefoot and hunting with spears and hunting with nets and wearing no clothes there is an argument for saying that they can probably think about this one too. But if they want to move with progress, as they are, then one of the things that marks progress is the respect that men have for women in society.16. The custom is made not just by the men, it is made by the women too. Anyone who understands anything about Aboriginal people understand that women’s business is a very significant part of Aboriginal custom and now non-violence to women is becoming a very significant aspect of Aboriginal custom.17. I have also heard from Aboriginal men that at the initiation ceremony, which I think probably is not practised as much as it used to be with men, but an undertaking was made by the men to speak softy to all and particularly to women. Well, if that be right, speaking with a fist is not speaking silently at all. You may not be using the voice but boy the action is so loud as to be deafening.18. Now, the bail conditions will be these. The appellant will be of good behaviour. He will reside initially at Roy Thorne Substance Misuse Rehabilitation Centre and abide by all directions of his case manager at that centre. He will accept supervision by Probation and Parole and accept all reasonable directions of his case manager with Probation and Parole.Does the appellant know where he will reside when he leaves Roy Thorne?MCCALLUM: I’ll just find that out, your Honour. -- Boland Drive Moree.HIS HONOUR: 19. Upon discharge from Roy Thorne he will reside at -- Boland Drive, Moree. He will continue with the Roy Thorne outpatients’ program and he will continue with his supervision with Probation and Parole. He will abstain from the consumption of all alcoholic beverages for the duration of the bail period. I should indicate that the bail period will be one of twelve months.20. He will submit to random testing, either by way of urine or breath analysis, for the detection of alcohol and/or illicit drugs as directed by Roy Thorne case manager or Probation and Parole case manager. Refusal to participate in a random test will be deemed a breach of bail and any dirty drug test or alcohol test will be deemed a breach of bail.21. He will attend court at all times required by the court. He will seek to make himself available for some sort of community activity at least three hours weekly after release from Roy Thorne, whether that be with a football team or a sporting team or the Salvation Army, some sort of voluntary work, so that he comes in contact with people who are not necessarily drug users, probably not drug users.22. He will attend Alcoholics Anonymous twice weekly once released from Roy Thorne. He will submit to random urine analysis as directed by Probation and Parole after leaving Roy Thorne no more than four times monthly for the purpose of detecting illicit drugs. Failure to attend any meeting, program or counselling required by either of his case managers will be deemed a breach of bail.23. He will provide proof of completing or participating in these activities that form part of his bail conditions by providing reports from Roy Thorne and or any voluntary organisation that he is working with, and Probation and Parole reports will be ordered each time that he is before the court.24. He will attend the court - I think I have said that, have I not? - at all times required, and we will just set those now.25. Bail may be granted by the officer in charge of prisoners at the Moree facility, I do not know what it is called, provided he is released into the custody of an approved person, for the purposes of going to Roy Thorne.26. The approved person will be Tom French or his authorised delegate.Mr Tighe, is there anything there you cannot do?APPELLANT: What?HIS HONOUR: Is there anything that I’ve just said you have to do that you think now “Gee, I can’t do that”?APPELLANT: Yeah, I can do it.HIS HONOUR: You can do it?APPELLANT: Yep.HIS HONOUR: So you’re quite satisfied that anything you don’t do is not because you can’t do it, it’s just because you didn’t do it?APPELLANT: Yep.HIS HONOUR: And in those circumstances would you agree that it would be a fair thing to send you back to gaol?APPELLANT: Yep.HIS HONOUR: Okay, that’s good. All right, off you go.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Bryan Greenfield appeals against his conviction for an offence of common assault. The incident occurred some time ago, on 29 October 2005. I describe it as an incident because there is no doubt that something happened that night. The question is whether it amounted to a common assault. To be more precise, the question is whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that that is what has occurred.2 Let me begin by noting some significant features very much in the appellant’s favour. He is a man of good character. He was thirty-five years of age at the time. The Crown says he assaulted his wife but there were no prior entries of violence or anything at all on his criminal history. That is a matter very much in his favour, both tending to suggest the unlikelihood that he committed the offence and his general credibility when he gave evidence denying it in court.3 The next matter strongly in the appellant’s favour is that there was a significant delay between when the complainant said she was assaulted and when she asked police to take action over the matter. Police did conduct some cursory investigations on 29 October 2005 but the evidence was that the complainant wished the matter to go no further because she was then pregnant and due to give birth shortly thereafter, and was returning to Perth from Sydney in any case. It was not until over a year later that the complainant, in effect, reactivated the matter. What happened in the meantime is the third matter pointing heavily in the appellant’s favour.4 There had been Family Court proceedings. As with almost all Family Court proceedings they appear to have been significantly contested, with a great deal of acrimony. It is notorious that those with any experience in the criminal law in this State often see allegations being made where those allegations are motivated by Family Court proceedings or issues that arise in those proceedings. 5 So we have in this case a man of prior good character who is alleged to have assaulted his wife, his wife clearly having a motive to make a false allegation and who has delayed taking steps which would have caused the prosecution to commence action against the appellant. These are significant matters, as I have said, weighing in the appellant’s favour. But that is not the entirety of the evidence before me by any means.6 What occurred on 29 October 2005 was witnessed, at least partially, by two independent witnesses, a Ms Tryst and a Ms De Francesco. They both gave evidence as to what they saw. Ms Tryst’s evidence, whilst it assisted the prosecution, did not assist in resolving the central allegation, namely, did the appellant punch his wife with a closed fist? The reason Ms Tryst’s evidence did not help is that, as she said to the magistrate, she turned around at one stage so that she was not able to see the appellant and the complainant and when she turned back she saw the complainant lying on the ground. What caused her to lie on the ground was not something she was able to see.7 But that is not the case for Ms Tryst’s friend, Ms De Francesco. Ms De Francesco’s attention was drawn to the appellant and the complainant. She said that they were at least arguing. It was not a case therefore of Ms De Francesco observing something to which her attention had not been drawn and which came as a complete surprise to her. Her evidence was that the appellant punched his wife with a closed fist to her left cheek. The appellant denies that but I am satisfied that it occurred and I am satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt, for reasons I will explain.8 Even given the complainant’s motivations to lie, which have caused me to examine her evidence carefully, it is significant that she too says that she was subject to a single punch to her left cheek. The concurrence of the evidence given by Ms De Francesco and the complainant on this issue tends very strongly to suggest its accuracy. Mr Maiden, who appeared for the appellant, suggested that the evidence of Ms De Francesco was confused. But having read Ms De Francesco’s evidence carefully I cannot see any evidence of confusion, in particular as regards the central allegation. Mr Maiden says that there are some conflicts in the evidence between Ms De Francesco and Ms Tryst. I do not regard those conflicts as significant, especially where, as I indicated, Ms Tryst’s back was turned when it is alleged by the prosecution that the punch was thrown by the appellant.9 Mr Maiden says that it is common ground that after the appellant’s wife fell to the ground he was concerned for her welfare, calling her “darling” and attempting to rouse her from unconsciousness. Mr Maiden suggests that that is inconsistent with the actions of a person who has just angrily punched his wife. I do not accept that submission. It is entirely consistent with the actions of a person who did not mean to cause his wife significant harm, that he would be most concerned about her welfare to see her lying on the ground apparently unconscious. The fact that the appellant felt immediate remorse and was prepared to assist his wife rather than simply walk off, or even worse inflict further violence, is not inconsistent with an angry punch thrown a moment before.10 Another aspect of the evidence that Mr Maiden relied on, appropriately, was what was said to be tendency evidence establishing, so it was said, a tendency of the complainant to act violently towards the appellant. There seems to be no doubt that the relationship was not a happy one and I am prepared to proceed on the basis that on a number of occasions the complainant acted violently towards the appellant after 29 October 2005. That may, and I am prepared to accept that it does, say something about the complainant’s attitude and the complainant’s character and her willingness to be violent towards the appellant. But even if I accept the appellant’s version as to the violence that his wife inflicted upon him that evening, four punches and a slap, that scarcely justifies him punching his wife in return. In terms of legal consequences, even if the appellant was punched and slapped by his wife, and even if he believed that it was necessary for him to punch his wife in self defence, that was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as the appellant perceived them. I take into account there that it was clearly obvious to the independent witnesses, and clearly known by the appellant, that his wife was heavily pregnant. It was not a reasonable response, even to being punched and slapped by his wife, for the appellant to have punched his wife in return with such force that it caused her to fall to the ground, striking her head as she did so. 11 There is one other matter of corroborative material to which I have not made mention yet and that is, that when a police officer saw the complainant in hospital she observed a swollen top lip. That circumstance is unexplained on the appellant’s version of events. Gentle slapping, presumably to the side of the face, in order to rouse her from unconsciousness, would be most unlikely to have caused the complainant’s lip to be swollen. Not only is that piece of evidence corroborative of what Ms De Francesco and the complainant say, namely, that there was a punch, but it also damages the appellant’s credibility. As I said, his version of events provides no explanation for that circumstance. Mr Maiden did submit that the police officer’s evidence of seeing a swollen top lip was not something that she apparently put in her statement. Despite that I am prepared to accept the accuracy of what the police officer observed. It is not a matter of looking at every piece of evidence individually but looking at the whole of the evidence to see whether there is support for individual pieces of evidence in the evidence of other people.12 Whilst I am dealing with credibility of the complainant, the Crown also points out that the appellant’s version of events is contradicted by the independent evidence of the other witnesses in other respects as well. I am not suggesting at all that the appellant has any onus of proof upon him. But in deciding whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt I am entitled, and indeed obliged, to look at the appellant’s evidence and to see whether that causes me to have any doubt as to whether the Crown has proved its case. I do not want to be taken to have suggested that the evidence in the prosecution case is all one way. There are matters in the prosecution case too which Mr Maiden is entitled to point to, and has pointed to, as also raising doubts. But on the whole of the evidence, for the reasons that I have indicated, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant punched his wife once to her left cheek causing her top lip to swell and that that was not a reasonable response to any violence to which the appellant had been subject. The appeal is dismissed and the conviction is confirmed. SUBMISSIONS WERE MADE ON SENTENCE13 HIS HONOUR: The consequences of a single punch can indeed be tragic. I had occasion recently to sentence someone for manslaughter after he punched a fellow pub goer who fell back, hit his head and died. As part of that process I had occasion to look at other sentencing decisions and discovered that, unfortunately, single punch manslaughters are relatively common. To punch someone, as the appellant did to his wife on this occasion, is a serious criminal act. It is seriously criminal in itself but the consequences which may flow from it are potentially disastrous.14 The appellant, as I mentioned in my judgment dismissing the conviction appeal, is a man of prior good character. He and his wife, the victim of the offence, have since separated but have been able to maintain what seems to be a civil relationship for the sake of their child. Both parties are to be congratulated for that attitude. If they are putting the welfare of their child above their own interests that is very much to their credit. That seems to be the case. I am told that the current issue in the Family Court relates to whether the appellant’s ex-wife should be able to relocate to Perth with consequential issues regarding access to their young son. From the material before me the appellant is, apart from this one offence, a good person and a valuable member of the community. The evidence establishes that the relationship between he and his wife was a difficult one, characterised by high emotion and occasional, if not regular, violence. Despite that this is the only criminal offence conviction of the appellant.15 Even in circumstances where his ex-wife might be motivated to make allegations against him, she has made but a single allegation and that is this one. I therefore accept without hesitation Mr Maiden’s submission that what occurred on this night is a one off. It is also notable that the appellant was immediately remorseful for what he had done. As soon as he saw his wife lying apparently unconscious on the ground he addressed her in familiar terms and was concerned for her welfare. He did not inflict further violence upon her, he did not walk away but he remained there to assist his wife. I am satisfied that he was most likely quite disturbed by what he had done. Mr Maiden seeks his client be given the benefit of an order under s 10 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There are two significant impediments to that. The first is that this was a very serious matter. True it is that it was a common assault only but to punch a heavily pregnant woman with such force that she fell to the ground thereby losing consciousness is grave indeed.16 The second difficulty concerns the appellant’s failure to plead guilty to an offence which both the magistrate and I are satisfied that he committed. That tends to suggest a lack of remorse. Any concerns he had for his wife that evening did not appear to have followed through to a willingness to accept responsibility for what he did. Despite those impediments, as I have described them, I am prepared to give the appellant the benefit of an order under s 10, primarily because I am satisfied that this is truly a one off event. Mr Maiden relied on a circumstance that the appellant, who is a Qantas pilot flying internationally, needs visas to fly to various locations and submitted that he would find it harder to get a visa if the magistrate’s order, a fine of $1,000, was maintained. Such submissions are often made in this court but rarely are they backed up by evidence. I am prepared to accept the possibility that the appellant might find it harder to get a visa to travel to various locations but I am not at all prepared to decide this case on the basis that there will be a significant impediment to the appellant carrying out his career were I to confirm the magistrate’s order.17 As I have said, the primary reason that the appellant will get the benefit of an order under s 10 is because I am satisfied this is a one off matter. So without proceeding to a conviction the appellant is released on a bond under s 10 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for a period of two years from today. The conditions of the bond are that he is to be of good behaviour, he is to appear before this court if called upon to do so and he is to notify the registrar of this court of any change in his residential address.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Alan Cosgrove appears for sentence today after having pleaded guilty at an early stage to an offence of break, enter and steal. Because of the plea, I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by twenty-five per cent. 2 When I sentence him for that matter he has asked that I take into account a matter on a Form 1, which is also a break, enter with intent to steal committed at about the same time as the matter for which Mr Cosgrove is to be sentenced.3 These offences were detected of course soon after they were committed, but the offender’s involvement was not made known until the results of DNA analysis were obtained. Although the offences were committed in December 2004, it was not until mid 2005 that the offender was charged with them. That, of course, raises a number of issues. The delay, for which the offender is not responsible, means that the offender is in a different position to the position he would have been in had he been dealt with soon after the commission of these offences. In particular in the offender’s case he was in the meantime sentenced for an offence of robbery. His non-parole period for that offence expired on 24 November 2006, and so the offender’s custody since that date has been solely referable to this matter. 4 I should also note that the offender has now been in continuous custody since 20 December 2004, a matter which is of particular significance when the issue of special circumstances is considered.5 The offender is now twenty-eight years of age. He has a criminal history which is sadly common amongst drug users. The offender’s drug use commenced at a very early age when he started to use alcohol and benzodiazepines on an experimental basis. By the age of fifteen he was consuming alcohol on a daily basis and using amphetamines every other day. He was imprisoned when he was sixteen. By the age of seventeen he had begun smoking heroin and matters progressed until he was injecting that drug.6 The offence for which the offender is to be sentenced was committed whilst he was a significant drug user. He was addicted to drugs and so clearly needed the money to pay for his drugs through criminal means. 7 The offence for which he is to be sentenced is particularly serious. The offender took an enormous quantity of valuable items from the home of his victim. He also took items that were no doubt of considerable emotional significance to those who owned them. A great deal of jewellery including two wedding bands were stolen by the offender. None of the property was recovered. 8 The consequences of offences such as this extend far beyond the individual victims too. It is no excuse at all that they were committed to buy drugs. However, the relevance of the offender’s drug addiction is primarily that his prospects of rehabilitation depend upon him overcoming his drug issues. The offender has been relatively drug free since his incarceration. I say relatively because he admitted to smoking marijuana since he was taken into custody. He recognises, however, that he needs some assistance in ensuring that he will remain drug free upon his release from custody. For that reason he attempted to do drug rehabilitation courses, but unfortunately once he was charged with this matter his classification was altered and it became impossible for him to continue the courses. He hopes to do the Nura Nura course before his release from custody, and it is my recommendation that that occur. It is unfortunate that the offender’s involvement in this matter was not detected earlier. If it was, I expect that more could have been done whilst he was in custody up until now to allow him to do the drug rehabilitation courses from which he would clearly benefit. Perusal of his custodial history shows that the offender has been moved from correctional centre to correctional centre over the last few years making any sort of continuous form of counselling or other rehabilitation impossible.9 I should mention the specific aggravating circumstance that this offence was committed whilst the offender was on bail. 10 He is on protection at the moment. That relates to his desire to cast aside some of his former associates because the offender believes that if he was to continue associating with them, it would make it much more likely that he would get involved in further criminal activity. His former associates have not reacted well to being cast aside, and so the offender is, as I said, currently on protection, although after I sentence him today, in the event that he is taken to a particular correctional centre, he proposes to sign himself off. I will, however, take into account that the offender has been on protection up until today and the conditions of such custody can be harder than those of the general prison population.11 I mentioned special circumstances before. There are clearly special circumstances in this case. Not only is there the problems I have identified with the offender’s ability to access rehabilitation programs in custody being interrupted after being charged for the present matter, but also the fact that the offender has been in continuous custody from 20 December 2004 must be recognised when I set the appropriate period of eligibility for parole in this matter. The adjustment in the offender’s favour from the statutory ratio will thus be a significant one.12 Mr Watts addressed me as to when the sentence should commence. As I mentioned earlier, the offender’s existing non-parole period expired on 24 November 2006. Mr Watts, however, submitted that I should backdate the commencement of the sentence to a period before then, recognising the issue of delay has led to a situation where the offender is entitled to what might be perceived as a generous allowance in order to be lenient to him. I do not propose to backdate the sentence as Mr Watts suggests. I have taken into account in formulating the sentence that the offender has suffered through the matter not being dealt with soon after the offence was committed, and to commence this sentence at a time when he was serving a non-parole period for another offence would be effectively to give the offender a benefit to which he is not entitled. To put it bluntly, he would be getting some time for free. Indeed, it is sometimes argued that in situations such as is facing me today the sentence should commence on the date it was imposed. I will commence the sentence on 25 November 2006.13 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of one year from 25 November 2006. It will expire on 24 November 2007, on which day the offender is to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of three years. 14 I recommend, as I said earlier, that the offender is placed in the Nura Nura program before his release from custody.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The offender Khaled Chaouk appears for sentence today on two specific matters; an offence of armed robbery and an offence of possessing an unauthorised pistol. When I sentence him for the first of those matters he asks that I take into account another eight matters on a Form 1, two of those were also offences of armed robbery. The offender was eighteen when he committed these serious offences. He is but nineteen now, almost twenty. 2 He has a relatively minor criminal history but it is somewhat remarkable that a person as young as this offender has committed such serious offences that it is the duty of this court to send him to gaol for a significant period of time. Mr Chaouk has started at the very top, not for him the commonplace gradual escalation of offending. It is to be hoped that the deterrent nature of the sentence I will announce on him in a few minutes and his experience of life for an extended period of time in an adult gaol will be of help to him upon his release. 3 These armed robbery offences were offences of a most serious kind. In each case the offender was armed with a firearm and in each case the victims of the robberies were also armed with firearms. The potential for disaster was enormous and it is probably a matter of good fortune, together with the good training of the victims of the various robberies, that no one was hurt. 4 The first of the offences of which the offender is to be dealt with today appears on the Form 1. It was committed at 8.25 am on 14 January 2008 when an Armaguard vehicle arrived at Bankstown Shopping Centre. The four guards in the vehicle were there to collect some money from a supermarket inside the shopping centre. They also had to deliver some change about $7,000 in coins. 5 They had been there for but a short time when a silver Mercedes drove up. The offender and two other men got out each wearing balaclavas and each armed with handguns. They approached the Armaguard officers pointing their handguns towards them and took the officer’s firearms, they also took the coins that I mentioned earlier. They tried to get into the vehicle itself but did not succeed. The three men then got back into the car which was driven by a fourth offender and it drove off. 6 Emboldened perhaps by their success, the offender and his co-offenders did something very similar the following day. This further offence of armed robbery also appears on the Form 1. This time they targeted an Armaguard vehicle at the Shell Service Station at Lidcombe. Two of the Armaguard officers took money from their van and went into the service station, they then came back to the van with money from the service station and put it into the vehicle. It was then that a black Mercedes motor vehicle, that had previously been stolen, drove into the service station area. 7 Once more three men, including this offender, got out of the car and pointed their fire arms at the Armaguard officers. One of the officers did what was asked but the other sought refuge in the rear of the Armaguard vehicle, The man who remained on the ground had his firearm stolen by one of the offenders. The offenders then made repeated demands for this now unarmed and presumably terrified officer to grant them access to the inside of the Armaguard vehicle. This was not possible due to the mechanical workings of the Armaguard vehicle. The fact that this could not be done no doubt added to the fear that this unfortunate officer felt. How was he to know that the demands made by the offenders who were clearly armed and dangerous would not escalate to actual violence? Fortunately, however, this did not occur but the man lying on the ground was not to know that at the time. The three offenders, as in the offence the previous day, went back to the Mercedes Benz, got into it and it was driven away by the fourth offender. 8 Thus far the offenders had managed to steal four firearms from security guards. They did not cease their activities. 9 The next offence was committed on 22 January 2008 and it is this offence for which the offender is to be specifically sentenced. This time it was a Chubb security van which attended a service station in Granville, the officers were there to replenish an automatic teller machine. There were four guards at the service station, one remained inside the armoured vehicle, one stood on the footpath and the two remaining guards entered the service station to do what they had to do. They carried the cash in cassettes ready to be used to replenish the ATM inside the service station. 10 The Mercedes Benz turned up once more and once again three men, including the accused, wearing balaclavas and armed with handguns, got out of the Mercedes Benz. It was this accused who approached the guard standing near the footpath, demanding his firearm. He actually removed the guard’s revolver from his holster. He stayed near this guard with his firearm pointed at the unfortunate security guard whilst the other two offenders ran into the service station. When they got there they ordered the security guards inside to lie on the ground, which the security guards did. Each of the offenders in the service station took the revolvers from the holsters of the security guards and grabbed two of the three cash cassettes that the security guards had brought in. The money that they took amounted to approximately $160,000. The three offenders then left by getting back into the Mercedes which was driven away at high speed. 11 It is worth noting that at the time of this offence the service station was open for business and a number of customers were filling their vehicles with petrol. All of these offences committed by armed offenders on armed security guards had, as I mentioned at the outset of these remarks the potential for many innocent bystanders to be harmed. No doubt they were frightened. The possibility of physical injury or death was very much a real one.12 As a result of some information which police obtained they were granted a search warrant relating to the accused’s residence in Merrylands. Police went to that residence where they spoke to two of the offender’s brothers. One of the brothers, Farouk, told police that one of the bedrooms in his house was his. In fact the bedroom really belonged to this accused. When police forced entry into the room, it being locked, they found two fully loaded Smith & Wesson .38 revolvers in an open wardrobe. It appears that those two were two of the six revolvers that had been stolen in the course of the robberies that I referred to. 13 Farouk maintained the lie that it was his room, not surprisingly therefore he was arrested, entered into custody and later released without charge. Also located in the bedroom were a further three revolvers, and a number of other items, including ammunition, a significant amount of Australian currency, balaclavas, gloves and clothing all connected with the offences that I have set out. To make things easy for the police, the offender had retained items which clearly connected him to the offences. Police soon worked out that Farouk was not telling the truth about whose bedroom it was, as the only items that they could identify in the room belonged to Khaled Chaouk. In those circumstances the offender surrendered himself to the police voluntarily. 14 Mr McClintock submits that that is consistent with his desire to assist the authorities and as evidence of his remorse. It is also to be noted that one of the things that his surrendering achieved was that police were finally able to determine once and for all that his younger brother was not involved in the offences.15 As I mentioned before the offender has a relatively minor criminal history and certainly there are no offences even approaching the seriousness of the ones I have just described, on his criminal history. The offender has had an uneventful childhood, his father has been working as a plumber and his mother cared for the children at home. The offender was raised in a close and loving family and his decision to engage in these offences is very difficult to understand indeed. Mr McClintock suggested that the evidence established that the offender was a good student achieving success at school, particularly in the area of graphic design until falling in with the wrong crowd. Since doing that the offender has left school, barely worked, commenced to use drugs and committed these most serious offences. 16 The offender suggested in material tendered before me that he was motivated to obtain money to buy drugs and to pay off a drug debt. It has to be said that Mr McClintock accepted the reality of the situation, so that whilst this partially explained why his client did what he did, a significant motivation for his client’s offending was simply greed.17 It is said that the offender has expressed his remorse since committing these offences. Evidence was tendered in the form of documents signed by the offender’s father and brother as to what the offender had said to them regarding his involvement in these offences. The offender’s brother’s statement is of particular relevance, he is employed as a security guard and the fact that his brother committed all of these offences against security guards was a matter of concern to the offender’s brother. 18 The offender expressed his remorse by speaking to others but gave no evidence about that today. The offender did not give sworn evidence about his feelings, about what he had done. The offender did not expose himself to cross-examination so whilst there is evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledged the consequences of his offending to the victims of it, the offender was not prepared to back that up by saying such things in the witness box today. There is evidence to establish remorse but I will frankly not place too much reliance on it in those circumstances. 19 Of course the starting point in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender is the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R, it could not be said that a small amount of money was taken. It could be said that the weapons used were significantly more dangerous than the weapon contemplated in the Henry guideline. In the offender’s favour the pleas of guilty were entered at an early stage and were not of limited utility as the Henry guideline contemplated. Of course these offences were also committed not only when the offender was armed but in company and it is a more serious offence to commit an offence of this type whilst armed and in company than whilst armed and alone. 20 Although the use of a weapon is an element of the offence the fact that the weapon in this case was of such potential lethality makes this offending more serious than would otherwise be the case. In the Henry guideline case, the postulated offence has a limited degree of planning. It is difficult to accept that that description applies to these cases. It could not be suggested realistically that the offenders were driving around in a stolen Mercedes with their gloves, balaclavas and firearms by their sides, waiting to come across a convenient armoured van. 21 Whether the offender was involved in the detail of the planning as to who was to do what or simply received instructions is not made clear on the evidence. But what is clear is that these offences were well planned and the offender accepted his role apparently. 22 Of course I could have already noted, but will do now that there is a significant amount of overlap between the circumstances in the Henry guideline and aggravating and mitigating features set out in s 21A of the Crimes Sentencing (Procedure) Act. One of those concerns the question as to whether the security guards were vulnerable, I want to make it quite clear that the fact that I have mentioned the factor under s 21A does not mean that I have double counted when that factor is also referred to in the Henry guideline. 23 Perhaps it was unnecessary to say, but it is best to make things clear. I do find that the security guards were vulnerable because of their occupation. The fact that they were armed does not reduce their vulnerability, they are obvious targets and vulnerable by reason of their occupation. I also take into account that it was not only money that was stolen, the theft of lethal firearms is a matter of great concern to the community, such weapons are highly valued by those who would, like the offender, commit offences using them. It is fortunate that most, but not all, it would seem, of the firearms stolen have been recovered.24 The offence of possessing an unauthorised pistol carries with it a standard non-parole period of three years, of course that standard non-parole period is not of direct application because of the plea of guilty but it remains as a guidepost which I will have regard to. I am satisfied that the offence is in the middle of the range for objective seriousness of offences of this type. There is, for reasons identified in the course of submissions an overlap between the armed robbery offence and the possess unauthorised pistol offence and I have been careful to take that overlap into account in formulating the length of the appropriate sentence.25 It is certainly not the case that the fact that many of these matters are on a Form 1 leads to only a small increase in penalty to be imposed. The offences are of such seriousness that there needs to be a substantial increase in the sentence to reflect the matters on the Form 1. Indeed it has to be said that there might be good arguments for suggesting that the placement of two armed robbery matters of this type on a Form 1 is inappropriate. Nevertheless that is not for me to decide, I deal with the matter as it is presented to me. 26 Mr McClintock appropriately relied significantly on the offender’s youth. As I mentioned he was only eighteen at the time of these offences, he is nineteen now, shortly to turn twenty. A person does not magically achieve on their eighteenth birthday the level of maturity that comes with becoming an adult. Specific sentencing principles apply when sentencing those under the age of eighteen, all or almost all based on the proposition the immaturity is a significant factor in determining what to do with an offender who commits a serious crime. Those principles, whilst not statutorily present in the present case, do not cease to be relevant simply because the offender has reached his eighteenth birthday. 27 I will take account in a significant way the youth of the offender. Because of his age he probably did not have the maturity to fully understand, and I emphasise the word “fully” understand the consequence of his actions. On the other hand the authorities with which the Crown, Mr McClintock and I are all familiar, make it very clear that when a young person commits an offence of an adult nature, these offences fully fitting that description, the weight that can be given to an offender’s youth is reduced. In any case the offender’s age clearly amounts to a special circumstance which allows me to vary the relationship between the non-parole period and head sentence that would otherwise apply. 28 Mr McClintock said that his client was unlikely to re-offend. I simply cannot make that finding based no the material presented to me today. There are prospects for the offender’s rehabilitation but I cannot say that he is unlikely to re-offend. Much will depend on how the offender matures over the next few years whilst he is in custody. In his favour, he has a loving family which has stood by him, they are present here in court today. If he is willing to accept their help then it is possible that he will be able to put offences of this type behind him. 29 I have structured the sentence in this way, I will impose a fixed term on the offence of possessing an unauthorised pistol and then taking into account the matters on the Form 1, impose a sentence for the armed robbery which is partially accumulated upon the fixed term.30 The sentences are as follows:31 For possessing an unauthorised pistol, I set a fixed term of imprisonment of two years to date from 25 January 2008, the day on which the offender went into custody, that is a fixed term because of the sentence I will now impose on the other matter.32 For the offence of armed robbery I set a non-parole period of three and a half years to date from 25 January 2009 and an overall head sentence of seven years. Thus the overall effective sentence is a period of imprisonment of four and a half years with a period of eligibility for parole of two and a half years, making a head sentence of seven years.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The trial of Peter Tsmilas commenced on Wednesday. On Thursday afternoon the Crown case closed. At Mr Brady’s request I gave the jury a Prasad direction. Five minutes later they acquitted the accused on both charges. The Crown case was such that I would have been very surprised if the jury had taken any other decision. An objective assessment of the evidence presented in the trial would demonstrate that the question as to who possessed the drugs was very much an open one, yet police seem to have focused on only one suspect, namely this accused. 2 That decision meant that the matter was poorly investigated. As matters stood, there was no prospect at all of the accused being convicted. 3 The facts adduced at the trial were these; a Mr Cave was the lessee of some premises in Zetland. The premises consisted of a main building containing three bedrooms and other accommodation and a garage at the rear of the premises. On top of the garage was a granny flat.4 On 4 March 2007, ambulance officers were called to that granny flat. They there found the accused acting in a state of delirium, thrashing about wildly, needing to be restrained, totally incoherent. Ambulance officers called police. A Sergeant Sherryn Howell attended the premises. She noticed what she took to be drugs and contacted further police to investigate what was going on. Those police, early on, formed the opinion that the drugs that were found in the granny flat were in the possession of the accused, the person who had been found in a state of psychosis. They accepted what Mr Cave told them, that is the accused was living in the granny flat, having moved from the main building where he had been living for two or three weeks, to the granny flat only a few days before.5 It has to be said that their acceptance of what Mr Cave said and their focus on the accused as the only suspect was surprising. This led them to fail to carry out basic investigations. I will give a couple of examples. The search was videorecorded. It is apparent that some clothes are found on the floor. Did the police examine those clothes to see whether they would fit the accused? No they did not. 6 When asked whether it would have been a relevant matter to ascertain whether the clothes were the accused’s size, one of the officers in charge gave evidence in the trial that it would not have been relevant. Also found during the search was a digital camera. Did police switch it on to see what photographs were recorded on it, if any? Again, they failed to do that.7 What the police failed to recognise was that there was a real possibility of obtaining evidence as to whether Mr Cave’s assertion that the accused was resident in the granny flat would hold water. A number of drugs were found in the granny flat. Two, in particular, were found in a locked cash box. The accused, who I repeat was in a state of psychosis when police arrived at the scene, was not in possession of a key to the cash box. 8 This significant matter did not apparently trouble the police nor the prosecution when they decided to charge and then continue proceedings involving the accused. 9 Where did the key to the cash box go if the accused was truly the possessor of the contents? An easy answer to that question is not obvious. I will return to the factual matters later in this judgment.10 As well as the evidence at trial, other evidence has been tendered this morning. That has not significantly added to any matter that I heard during the trial.11 In particular evidence was not adduced from Mr Brady as to an important aspect of his case, that is that his client went to 13 Telford Street, Zetland to purchase drugs from Mr Cave. I know that is an important aspect of the accused’s case because Mr Brady opened to the jury in those terms but no evidence to that effect was given by the accused (because the jury accepted the Prasad direction at the close of the Crown case). The matters raised by Mr Brady’s opening, therefore that can be put to one side.12 The test I have to now apply is one which is based on the artificial situation postulated under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act. That is if the prosecution had known when they instituted proceedings what they now know would it have been reasonable to bring the proceedings? In order to succeed under the present application, the onus is on the accused to demonstrate that the matters in s 3 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act are present. The matters in s 3 were conveniently re-stated by Justice Simpson in the matter of R v Johnson [2000] NSWCCA 197 and I quote from para 16: 
     
      
       
      “The circumstances in which a certificate may be granted are those stated in s 3 of the Act, they may be conveniently re-stated as involving the following process,  
      
     
     
      
      (1) an evaluation of all of the evidence as it emerged at trial, 
       
       
      (2) an assumption that all of that evidence was available to the prosecution before the proceedings were instituted, 
       
       
      (3) a determination whether if the prosecution had been in possession of all of that evidence it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings where it is concluded in those circumstances it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings,  
       
       
      (4) a determination whether any act or omission of the accused contributed to the commencement or continuation of the proceedings and where such an act or omission is found to exist by determination of whether that act or omission was in the circumstances reasonable”. 
       
       
      
    13 What I have to do is look at the position of a hypothetical prosecutor possessed of all of the information at trial and the evidence tendered on this application and decide whether it would have been reasonable for that hypothetical prosecutor to have instituted the proceedings.14 One of the matters raised by the Crown on the present application is that it was not reasonable for the accused to keep to himself the suggestion that he went to the premises to purchase drugs, I can put that to one side as I said because there is no evidence to that effect before me. I decide this application ignoring the contents of Mr Brady’s opening because it was not supported by any evidence.15 Let me look at the evidence that is before me. The suggestion that the accused was residing in the granny flat was based on his presence there, the fact that his wallet was there, the fact that a letter addressed to him from BMW Australia was there and also oral evidence from Mr Cave. Let me talk about Mr Cave. Mr Cave is a convicted drug dealer. Some time after the events of 4 March 2007, Mr Cave was arrested for dealing in drugs. He pleaded guilty to supplying some of those but admitted that he also had in his possession a wide range of other drugs, those were ignored for the purposes of his sentencing in the course of negotiations with the DPP but Mr Cave gave evidence about them yesterday. 16 It is very important to note that the type of drugs that Mr Cave admitted supplying were similar to the type of drugs which the Crown alleged the accused possessed for the purposes of supply on 4 March. It is also important to note that Mr Cave admitted to supplying drugs of the type that he later pleaded guilty to supplying at around the time of Mr Tsmilas’ arrest. Now is perhaps the time to note that Mr Tsmilas has no prior convictions whether for drug related matters or otherwise. 17 There were many problems with Mr Cave’s evidence. Let us start with the contents of a note tendered by the Crown during the trial. That note, written by Mr Cave refers to Mr Tsmilas having been the occupant of the granny flat. Mr Cave said that he wrote that note before police arrived and left it with the accused. He said that he later recovered a couple of pages of that note. Clearly the defence case was that the note was written by Mr Cave in order to back up his evidence that it was the accused who was the resident of the granny flat in order to make it more likely that the drugs found by police there belonged to the accused rather than one of the other occupants of the premises.18 Mr Cave said that because there were personal matters in the note he tried to recover it so that police would not see it but he was only able to find two pages of a note containing many more pages than that. He said that he kept those pages in his hand for some forty-five minutes and when police approached him with the remaining pages they noticed that he was still holding them and it was in that circumstance that the note was collated. The note was written in Texta, Mr Cave admitted writing in Texta. One of the contents of the cash box was a pill bottle on which someone had written in Texta. Mr Cave’s version as to what happened with the note are inconsistent with the police evidence. It was their evidence that he provided the note to them . As a whole the police evidence is much more likely to be true.19 On Mr Cave’s version there would be visible, in the search warrant video, pages of the note scattered around the room. I could see no such material. This means that what most likely really happened with the note is this: well after police had arrived and discovered the drugs, Mr Cave presented them with a note in which convenient reference was made to the fact that the accused was living in the premises. Perhaps, and just perhaps police might be forgiven for not being sceptical about the convenient nature of that material, but once it became clear later on that Mr Cave was a drug dealer, matters should have been revisited. The police should have noted the correlation between the texta used to write the note and the texta used to mark one of the contents of the cashbox. If they had not then the prosecutor should have noted it.20 Another matter concerned a somewhat startling aspect of the police search warrant video. Police opened a backpack lying in the room. They pulled out a dildo, then they pulled out another one and kept going. Various sex toys were shown before police returned them to the backpack and zipped it back up again. Two significant aspects of the contents of the backpack were these. Firstly Mr Cave gave evidence at the relevant time he was working at a sex shop, a sort of shop where items such as the contents of the backpack could easily be obtained. There was also a suggestion at the time of his arrest on drug supply charges he was working as a prostitute. Those two matters tend to suggest the likelihood that the backpack was owned by him, that is Mr Cave. Also in the backpack were two bottles of liquid, closely related to items found within the cashbox. That is yet another matter pointing away from the accused’s possession of the items in the cashbox and towards Mr Cave.21 I will mention that I have put aside one aspect of Mr Cave’s evidence, I mention it only to demonstrate that I have put it aside. Mr Cave sniffed constantly throughout his evidence. It was at least indicative of the possibility that he had ingested drugs by sniffing them recently. However when questioned he said he had a cold and coughed. I am prepared to give him, and therefore the prosecution in this matter, the benefit of the doubt. I will ignore the way Mr Cave gave his evidence.22 Other aspects of the case suggesting that the accused did not live in the granny flat include the lack of clothing, apart from some clothing which as I mentioned earlier, police did not even bother to find out whether it fitted the accused. But perhaps more importantly there was not a great deal of personal items such as clothing which might be expected if someone were actually living in the granny flat. There was conflicting evidence as to whether there was even a toothbrush there. 23 The Crown could have only ever succeeded by proving that Mr Cave’s evidence should be accepted beyond reasonable doubt. The hypothetical prosecutor would know that Mr Cave lived at the premises, that he had a key to the granny flat, that he was later to admit that around the time of the relevant events involving the accused he was a drug supplier, that the drugs that he supplied were broadly similar to those alleged in relation to the accused.24 A hypothetical prosecutor would know that it was likely because of Mr Cave’s occupation, that the backpack in the granny flat was his, and the hypothetical prosecutor would regard it as particularly important, because not only did that suggest that Mr Cave kept some of his property in the granny flat, (quite personal property too at that), but also because of the drugs found in the backpack. 25 In my view, when looking at all the evidence and armed with all the information that the hypothetical prosecutor had, it was clearly not reasonable for these proceedings to be instituted.26 There are many problems with the Crown case which could be described as insurmountable, but perhaps the most important concern is the question as to where the key to the cashbox was. If the accused was truly guilty and if the contents of the cashbox were truly his, what did he do with the key? There was no evidence that it was ever found in his possession, and yet there was evidence that he was not really in a fit state to have hidden it. Even if the drugs were found in an open box and the key issue is put to one side, the matters affecting the credibility of Mr Cave are so significant that it would still have been unreasonable to the hypothetical prosecutor to institute proceedings. Once Mr Cave’s evidence was called into question, indeed once it was shown that he had convictions for drug dealing, the Crown case fell away. 27 I wish to say something about the police investigation in this case. What I am about to say in no way calls into question the acquittal of Mr Tsmilas. I have contemplated why it is that the police had only one suspect. Perhaps an explanation is that police intelligence suggested that Mr Tsmilas was dealing in drugs before police found him in the psychotic state he was. Perhaps that is why they focussed only on him. Even if that is the case, that does not excuse what is clearly a shoddy investigation. I’ve referred to some aspects of that in the course of this judgment. It’s one thing to have police intelligence, the reliability of which is very uncertain. It is another thing to carry out a proper investigation which may reveal that the police intelligence was in error, or it may reveal its accuracy. But police intelligence is no excuse for failing to investigate matters as should have been done in this case.28 I mention by way of comment only, that despite being a judge for six years and having given Prasad directions with some regularity, this is the first occasion on which a jury has acquitted the accused upon hearing my direction. That in itself is a very good indication of the terrible state of the Crown case which is attributed to the hypothetical prosecutor. 29 I am satisfied that it was not reasonable for the proceedings to have been instituted and I am satisfied that no act or omission of the accused contributed to the commencement or continuation of proceedings. I therefore grant Mr Brady’s application for a certificate under s 2.30 I am satisfied that if the prosecution had before the proceedings were instituted been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings. I am satisfied that no act or omission of the defendant contributed or might have contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings. It therefore follows that in terms of s 3 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act. I am also satisfied that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed or might have contributed to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.

    JUDGMENT1. This appellant appeals against convictions recorded by Magistrate Farnan in the Local Court at Sutherland on 15 September 2009. She was before the court on that occasion for four speeding offences: one that occurred on 13 October 2006 in the Eastern Distributor, a second that occurred on 28 October 2006, also in the Eastern Distributor, a third that occurred on 12 November 2006 on Henry Lawson Drive and the fourth that occurred on 10 December 2006 at Henry Lawson Drive. 2. An appeal to this court is a re-hearing of the evidence by way of the transcripts of the Local Court and in this case also by way of other documents handed up on the question of the relevant address of the appellant.APPELLANT: Your Honour I do have the other two as well.HIS HONOUR: Thank you, just sit down please. 3. Each of the four matters was a camera detected offence. The appellant’s situation is that she was not, she says, the driver of the relevant vehicle, which is the same vehicle in all offences at the time that these offences were committed. Before the Magistrate she nominated as the relevant driver, an uncle, a man by the name of P-A-N-G-I-O-T-I-S P-A-N-O-U-S-I-S, who as events transpired passed away on 27 August 2008 at the age of 79. 4. It was her case that she was not the driver; that she had sent statutory declarations to the RTA; that she has spent hours discussing this and trying to contact them by phone; that they had apparently lost the first lot of statutory declarations even though she had sent them by over night mail where you get a little number and that she had sent in a number of statutory declarations later. 5. Those of us who have been unfortunate enough to receive penalty notices would know that on the penalty notice is a contained a statutory declaration for the purpose of advising the Roads and Traffic Authority, firstly, that the registered owner was not at the relevant time the driver and secondly nominating the name and address, if known, of the person who was in charge of the vehicle.6. What is also significant to remember is that on that form is the address to which those documents should be sent. On this occasion the complainant’s case is each of the four apparently did not arrive at its intended destination. I find that a proposition that is difficult to accept, 1 certainly, 2 possibly, 3 would be a real coincidence, but 4, would appear to me be just not on the cards.APPELLANT: Forgive me your Honour, they were all sent together.HIS HONOUR: You’ve had your opportunity, if you do not like what is in this, you may take it somewhere else. 7. It is also her case that in the course of speaking to them on the 8 May 2007 she did not think that any of the matters would have been out of date. She said that she sent them collectively and that they dealt with them separately on 8 June and 22 June.  She made the point that: 
     
      
      It serves them right,” but since the person driving is deceased that they are not going to get anywhere and that serves them right. She said that was divine justice because in 2006 he was certainly alive, he was an uncle and he has passed away.  
      
    She handed up material in respect of the uncle and I will come to that in a minute.8. A nominated person she told her Honour was Peter Panousis who was my uncle who passed away in 2008. The appellant had evidence of a funeral leaflet or brochure concerning him and a letter from her aunty confirming that he drove her car. That letter as will be seen in a moment does not deal with the relevant dates but certainly it raises, if it were accepted, a reasonable possibility perhaps, and a letter from his doctor. They were tendered and marked as Exhibit 3. 9. As that material appeared, it would have been open to her Honour to understand that Peter Panousis was said to be the driver on all four occasions. The appellant gave this evidence: 
     
      
      “I will say for the RTA’s benefit and since then it has come to my attention, that on occasions that the person I gave the car to was driving, my uncle. My uncle was also driving on the other two occasions.” 
      
    10. The evidence was that in October she would have sent the first one. That of course contradicts the proposition that she sent them all together. Because in October she had not received the November and December ones - says that they would have been the first she sent. Then she says a little later down on the same page: 
     
      
      “I sent one lot, I actually have copies of the fax received there. I sent one lot on 11 May.” 
      
    11. In the course of cross-examination the appellant was confronted with a statutory declaration in the possession of the RTA, in which she had nominated a person by the name of Tony Rapotos as the driver of the vehicle on the latter two dates. HH INTERRUPTED BY FURTHER SUBMISSIONS FROM THE APPELLANT 12. On 27 October 2007 there appears a letter on the letterhead of one Dr Brett Thompson, 5/62 Alison Crescent, Menai, addressed “To Whom it May Concern”. It gives the address of the appellant as 40A Cairns Street, Riverwood, and it is in these terms: 
     
      
      “Pangiotis Panousis of 52 Port Madoc Drive, suffers from cirrhosis of the liver with widespread metastases, diabetes and depression. He is severely unwell and his condition is terminal. His niece, Angela Liati, is his principal carer. She provides daily care and takes him to his medical appointments, which are required on a frequent basis. For this she needs to be able to drive. If this care was no longer able to be given, in particular if she couldn’t take him to appointments, his condition would significantly worsen. Yours sincerely--“ 
       
      
    - And I note the signature is covered over with a document. I cannot be satisfied that that document was ever signed by the doctor, or ever produced by him.APPELLANT: Forgive, your Honour - I have the original, your Honour. And I hope your Honour is not confusing that date with - that’s the October 2007, that’s a year later, a year after the offence, which is October 2006, your Honour, but I have the original, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I have been handed a document, which is said to be the original, in which--APPELLANT: Forgive me, the original may have been sent to the RTA, that could be a copy.HIS HONOUR: --in which the word B-R-E-T-T and two, possibly three other letters appear as the signature of Brett Thompson, which appears to be the original of the document I am speaking of.13. There is also a letter in these terms from one Dimitria Panousis, who says that her husband Peter Panousis passed away through his liver cancer in July 2008.  
     
      
      “Prior to this, and in particular during 2006, my niece Angela Liati spent a lot of time driving my husband to different places, including doctors’ appointments, hospitals for radiation, and other treatments, shopping trips, haircuts, and took him out for lunches, and other outings including visits to friends.  
       
       
      On a few occasions my husband enjoyed driving Angela’s car, which was a 2005 Toyota Avalon. I know this because he told me at the time, and although I cannot remember the exact date, I know it was definitely during 2006.” 
       
      
    What I note about that letter is that there is no reference to the car being leant to anybody else with her husband in it. All of the driving was said to have occurred in circumstances where she was in it.14. The appellant now says that the penalty notices were sent to her, as I understand it, at an address in Abbotsford, Unit 3, 54 St Albans Street, Abbotsford. That address plays some part in a document where the State Debt Recovery Office has sent her a notice of some kind, information supplied under s 51 of the Fines Act, to her at 40A Cairns Street, Riverwood, in respect of a 10 December offence, and it may well be in respect of an earlier offence, the November offence I think was also sent to that address. There is one in October 2006 sent to her at 40A. In each case they make the note that a penalty reminder notice relating to the offence was also served upon her at Unit 3, 54 St Albans Street, Abbotsford on or about 2 March 2007. It was also sent on or about 16 January 2007 in relation to the 26 October matter, and also sent on the same date in relation to the 12 November matter. So that two addresses were used to contact, it would seem to me.15. The fact that something was sent to her at Unit 3, 54 St Albans Street, Abbotsford does not establish the proposition that the penalty notice was sent to that address, and indeed the evidence is to the contrary. There is a s 221 Motor Accidents Compensation Act certificate which establishes that on 28 October 2006 the relevant vehicle was registered - or recorded in the appellant’s name whose last recorded address is DUP 1/40 Cairns Street, Riverwood, New South Wales.HH INTERRUPTED BY FURTHER SUBMISSIONS FROM PARTIES 16. This morning I commenced a judgment in the appeal of Angela Liati in respect of four speeding charges. In the course of that judgment Ms Liati sought to make more submissions. In the course of the judgment I also was concerned as to whether the penalty notices were sent to the correct address. At that time I was operating under the assumption that they should have been sent to an address at 40 A Cairns Street Riverwood. It is clear that at that time, that is, at the time of the offences and until August of 2007 the appellant was living at unit 3 54 St Albans Street Abbotsford and notices were sent to that address. There is evidence that documents that were sent to that address at about that time had been received by the appellant and I am satisfied that the relevant penalty notices for the four offences were sent to that address.17. It is conceded that within the relevant twenty-one days statutory declarations were not received by the RTA. There is a claim that some were sent individually. There is a claim that all were sent together. I am satisfied that none were received by the RTA and that in the normal course of events they would have been received if they had been sent.18. I am also satisfied that during May 2007 the appellant was doing all she could to have statutory declarations sent and received by the RTA, and it appeared to me that at least some of them, if not all of them, were received but that was outside the twenty-one days. She was at that time and ever since saying that she was not the driver.19. As I earlier said before lunch, each of the offences was a camera detected offence, and the history of traffic prosecutions in the Local Court and the Appeals Court, that is appeals in this Court, are replete with challenges to convictions arising from camera detected matters. There are two main themes to such defences. One is I am not the driver, and the second is a defence relating to the capacity of the equipment to calculate accurately the speed of the vehicle. 20. I do not need to concern myself with the second because in this case it is the first that is being looked at. But I note that in respect of both of those themes, the legislature, no doubt acting on recommendations of the RTA, has introduced legislation which assists the prosecution of offences where registered owners or drivers raise issues challenging the accuracy of the equipment, or the presence of the registered owner behind the steering wheel. In this case the challenge is, as I say, made by the appellant that she was not the driver in each of these cases. The appellant is in each case the registered owner of the motor vehicle. 21. As will be seen, the legislation to which I refer puts an obligation upon the registered owner to give notice to the RTA of two matters. Firstly, that the registered owner was not the driver and, secondly, the name and address of the person who was driving. Strictly speaking, the obligation as set out in the legislation is expressed as one requiring the supply of a statutory declaration of the name and address of the person in charge of the vehicle on the occasion of the offending conduct within twenty-one days of service; see s 179(4) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 No 11. However, it may be that some period of grace is allowed. There is, it seems to me, up to a forty day period from posting the penalty notice by the RTA in which the registered owner can advise the RTA of two matters referred to above; see again s 179(5).22. The learned magistrate set out the relevant sections in her judgment and I suppose I need to do the same in this, but the principal hurdle the appellant has is the application of s 179(1) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 to her case. Section 179 is to be found in chapter five of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 No 11. It is entitled “Enforcement of Road Transport Legislation”. Section 179 is one of the sections contained in pt 5.1 “Liability for Offences”. Section 179 is headed:“Liability of Responsible Person for Vehicle for Designated Offences”: 
     
      
      “(1)  
      Responsible person for vehicle taken to have committed designated offences 
      . If a designated offence occurs in relation to any registrable vehicle, the person who, at the time of the current of the offence, is the responsible person for the vehicle is taken to be guilty of an offence under the provisions concerned in all respects as if the responsible person were the actual offender of the designated offence unless... 
       
       
      (The vehicle was at the relevant time stolen or the actual offender would have had a defence to any prosecution)” 
      
    It is clear, as the learned magistrate said, that the legislation envisages occasions when the responsible person is not in fact the actual offender. That is to be seen in the terms of s 179(1) and also in the terms of s 179(2), “liability of actual offender unaffected”. Nothing in this section affects the liability of the actual offender. However, if a penalty has been imposed on or recovered from any person in relation to any designated offence no further penalty may be imposed on or recovered from any other person in relation to the offence. 23. The appellant sought to take advantage of subs 4 and I will set that out. Subsection 4 is headed:“Duty to Inform if Person Not Driver of Vehicle for Committing Camera Recorded Offence”: 
     
      
      “A person who: 
       
       
      (a) is served with a penalty notice...in respect of a camera recorded offence and 
       
       
      (b) was not the driver of the vehicle to which the offence relates at the time the offence occurred 
       
       
      (c) must within twenty-one days after service of the notice supply by statutory declaration to the authorised officer...the name and address of the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the time the offence occurred.” 
       
      
    24. In subsection 4 it is presumed that the penalty notice served on the person by post is served on that person twenty-one days after it is posted unless the person establishes that it was not received by the person or was not received by the person within the twenty-one day period. The appellant has also sought to claim that was so. I am satisfied that it was not so. There were four different penalty notices, each sent by mail. Her claim is that she received none of them. I find that fanciful.25. Subsection 8 does give an “out” when responsible person for vehicle not liable for camera recorded offence: 
     
      
      “A person who is served with a penalty notice...in respect of a camera recorded offence is not guilty of that offence by operation of this section if the person (a) complies with subs 4 in relation to the offence or (b) satisfies the authorised officer...that person did not know or could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained the name and address of the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the time the offence occurred.” 
       
      
    None of those provisions in (8) applies here. It is established to my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant has failed to comply with subs 4, and, likewise, I am satisfied that at all times she knew, or could with reasonable diligence have ascertained the name and address of the person she claims was in charge of the motor vehicle.26. In the event I do not have to determine whether she was the driver or whether some other person was the driver. I note that the magistrate did not make any such determination but simply noted a claim of the appellant not to be the driver. The claim at the earliest can be dated, it seems to me, in May 2007.27. This is a conviction that will stand as a consequence of the provision of s 179(1), and in all the circumstances I have reviewed both the facts before the magistrate, come to my own view of them. I have reviewed her Honour’s decision, not that it is necessary really for me to comment on it. I simply find myself in agreement with it, although I may have expressed myself differently because I am working on my own findings of fact. I come to the same conclusion that her Honour did, that in respect of each of the offences a conviction cannot be avoided because of the application of s 179.28. The conviction is confirmed. There is no appeal against the penalties. The penalties are confirmed. Court costs are likewise confirmed.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Joseph Gregory Rider pleaded guilty today to an offence of supplying amphetamine. This was not the first time he has pleaded to that offence. The offence was committed as long ago as 1995. The offence came to light in the following circumstances: the offender was at the Courthouse Hotel on 20 January 1995. He was playing the poker machines. After he left the hotel, staff discovered that he had left something behind. It was a metal canister with a brown lid. That canister, upon inspection, proved to contain a white powder in clear plastic resealable bags. The hotel staff called police who arrived a short time later and took possession of the canister. A little while later the offender came back to the hotel and asked staff members if it had been handed in. It was at this stage that the offender was arrested. He was taken back to Surry Hills police station. He made admissions that the canister found by hotel staff and then given to police was his and that he was the possessor also of the white powder inside it.2 The powder weighed more than 60 grams and proved to be amphetamine. He pleaded guilty at the Local Court to an offence of supplying the drug but once he came to this court he did not adhere to his plea and so the matter was set down for trial. On the day that the matter was listed for trial, in November 1996, he again entered a plea of guilty. The matter was therefore stood over for sentence but on that occasion just before he was about to be sentenced he withdrew his plea and the matter was therefore listed for trial again, this time in March 1997 and once again on the day of trial a plea of guilty was entered. Again the matter was stood over for sentence but merely three days later the plea was once again withdrawn. The matter was stood over for trial once more. On this occasion the offender simply did not appear. Instead he, after some time, travelled to Tasmania where he lived with his parents. In that time he appears to have overcome the drug addiction that he had and lived a drug-free life for some considerable time.3 However he returned to Sydney in about 2002 and although it was not an immediately thing, he then fell back into his old ways and consumed methylamphetamine. In order to maintain his habit he also began to supply methylamphetamine and so it was that on 26 April 2007 police arrested him, searched him and found that he was in possession of 2.7 grams of methylamphetamine. Some of this was for his own use and some of this was for the purposes of supply.4 Police enquiries also revealed that he had an outstanding warrant that was issued after his failure to appear at trial in April 1997. The offender was also charged with a number of other offences arising out of his conduct on 26 Aril 2007, supplying the methylamphetamine that was found in his possession, receiving (relating to a Bose DVD entertainment system) and attempting to dispose of stolen property (presumably that also relating to the same entertainment system which the offender told police he intended to sell on behalf of a person called Joe).5 The offender was brought up in Tasmania where his parents still live. His relationship with his parents was somewhat difficult due to his temper, and in particular whilst under the influence of drugs his propensity to be abusive and violent. Once he came to Sydney he commenced using drugs and worked as a prostitute. His addiction became quite severe so that by 1995 he was using up to 7 grams of amphetamine a day and in order to support his habit he committed the offence for which he is to be sentenced today. 6 Shortly before he returned to Tasmania, that is after he failed to attend at his trial, he discovered that he was HIV positive. This clearly had an effect upon him and I gather was one of the reasons that he moved to Tasmania and then was able to remain drug-free whilst there.7 Of course one of the most important factors in assessing the appropriate sentence in this case is the delay which has occurred since the commission of this offence, twelve years ago, although not to much can be made of it because the delay is very much due to the offender absconding. He should have appeared at trial but simply chose not to. It is difficult to say in those circumstances that the offender should be rewarded for his misconduct. On the other hand I have to sentence him as he is today, not as he was twelve years ago. 8 This is a case where the offender has demonstrated two things. Firstly that he is capable of getting off drugs and being a worthwhile citizen, that is he is capable of rehabilitation. But it has also demonstrated the need for a sentence to be imposed upon him which would act as a substantial personal deterrent against the offender committing further offences of this nature in the future. It seems that the offender all too easily fell into his old ways after a period of time back in Sydney. 9 The sentence that I will shortly announce upon him has been formulated with the idea of personal deterrence very much in mind. 10 The offender now says, and I have no hesitation in accepting, that he wishes to rehabilitate himself, that he wishes to get off drugs and that he wishes to put his old ways behind him. He has been accepted into a residential rehabilitation programme. Clearly he will not be able to attend that programme in the near future because of the need to impose a sentence upon the offender which properly reflects the objective gravity of his most serious drug-dealing conduct. But I consider that a residential rehabilitation programme such as the one to which the offender has been accepted, that is at Glebe House, the twelve week programme there, will benefit him considerably. 11 Accordingly I will make a finding in his favour of special circumstances. It will be a condition of his release to parole that he is only released to a residential rehabilitation programme, that is a form of quasi custody. And so I have taken that into account in deciding the appropriate ratio between non parole period and head sentence. 12 It is a matter of aggravation that the offender was on a bond at the time he committed this offence. In fact that bond was also imposed for a drug offence. I also have to bear in mind that the offender is asking me to take into account three matters on a Form 1 and there will be an appropriate adjustment to the sentence I would have otherwise have imposed upon him to reflect those offences. In particular it is necessary to reflect his further misconduct in 2007 where he once again supplied a most dangerous drug, namely methylamphetamine. 13 The offender pleaded guilty today as I mentioned at the outset of these remarks on sentence, and accordingly consideration has to be given to whether, there is a discount on the basis of utilitarian benefit for the plea of guilty and if so, how much that should be. It is not an absolute rule that a plea of guilty must always result in a discount for a utilitarian benefit. In this case I consider that the offender’s history of entering pleas of guilty and then withdrawing them repeatedly, and then ultimately absconding is such that there should be no discount given for his plea of guilty. That is not to say there is not a utilitarian benefit in avoiding the need to conduct a jury trial, but it is to say that it is not a universal rule that a discount on such a basis should be given to a plea of guilty and I do not consider it is appropriate to give such a discount in the present circumstances.14 The offender impresses me, from the short time that I saw him in the witness box, as a genuine man who is committed to the idea of him putting his drug addiction behind him. I am satisfied that he has a genuine desire to rehabilitate himself but it must be recognised that the road ahead is not going to be a smooth one. He will need some assistance and that is part of the reason that I have decided to find special circumstances. Ultimately, however, I am constrained by one important factor and that is that the non-parole period to be imposed for his drug supply offence has to reflect the objective gravity of his misconduct. That is the case even in a case such as this where there has been a delay between offence and sentence. Although in an appropriate case the authorities speak of an undue level of leniency being offered to an offender, I do not consider that this is a case where undue leniency is appropriate. The sentence I am going to announce is the most lenient I consider appropriate in view of the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. Because this offence was committed before 1 February 2003, I should announce the head sentence first, followed by the non parole period.15 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. Taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I impose a sentence of imprisonment of three years to date from 26 April 2007. I set a non parole period of eighteen months also to date from 26 April 2007. It will expire on 25 October 2008. On that date the offender is to be released to parole but it is a condition of his release to parole that he enter a residential rehabilitation programme, preferably the twelve week programme at Glebe House.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Raymond John Adam Donley appears before me for sentence as a consequence of adhering to a plea of guilty entered to a charge in the Local Court at Liverpool. The charge was that he on 7 March 2007 at Lurnea did attempt to rob Meng Sea Ly of certain property, to wit a sum of cash the property of Pizza Hut Pty Ltd whilst being armed with an offensive weapon namely a large knife or machete. The implement as far as I can glean from the photographic evidence before me was in fact a machete.2 Not only was the Offender armed but he was also in company with Daniel Paul Wilson. 3 At approximately 3pm on Wednesday 7 March 2007 the Offender and his co-offender met each other at the co-offender’s residence in the suburb of Miller. They then went to the Miller Hotel and consumed alcoholic drinks. They then left the hotel and picked up the co-offender’s brother and drove to Campbelltown. Whilst travelling in the car, Daniel Wilson discussed the idea of committing a robbery with a knife in order to obtain money to lighten the financial hardship which he then thought himself to be suffering.4 They arrived at Campbelltown at approximately 7pm. Wilson played a game of soccer and the Offender attended the Campbelltown Tennis Club for a poker competition. At approximately 9pm they returned to Wilson’s home unit at Miller. Whilst in the co-offender’s unit, there was a further discussion of robbing the Pizza Hut store located at Lurnea. Wilson armed himself with a machete which he kept in his bedroom and both the offenders left the unit on foot.5 At approximately 10pm they arrived outside the Pizza Hut at Lurnea and concealed themselves in some bushes adjacent to the store waiting for members of the public to leave it. The two offenders then pulled the hoods of their jumpers over their heads to obscure their faces. Wilson removed the machete from his sleeve and carried it beside his body. Both then went towards the store. Wilson approached the counter. 6 It is clear from the photographic evidence before me that the present Offender did not enter the store by any great distance. Indeed the photographic evidence shows the present Offender as being astride the threshold of the store with one foot outside and with one foot inside, observing what was being done by Wilson. At all material times the present Offender remained at the door keeping a lookout. The only person present in the store at the relevant time was the store manager, Mr Meng Ly.7 On seeing the co-offender and the present Offender, Mr Ly activated the hold-up alarm and ran from the store via the rear door. Wilson then jumped the counter and attempted to access the cash register to remove cash from it. Wilson was unable to open the cash drawer and both Wilson and the present Offender then ran from the store empty-handed.8 Shortly after that police attended at the Pizza Hut at Lurnea and obviously made inquiries of the store manager and then began patrolling for suspects. The present Offender and his co-offender were sighted by police outside the Miller shops. Both the Offender and his co-offender then sought to run away but the Offender was apprehended by police and conveyed to Green Valley Police Station. The co-offender was more fleet of foot than the present Offender and managed to escape the police and run to an unknown location.9 At the Green Valley Police Station, the Offender was introduced to the custody manager. His rights were read to and explained to him and he then participated in an electronic record of interview with a suspected person. He made full admissions to the police of his part in the present offence and told police that both he and his co-offender were in financial difficulties.10 It is accepted that in that interview the Offender disclosed the identity of his co-offender which would have enabled the police to arrest the co-offender when they wished to. However before that was done, the co-offender presented himself to Green Valley Police Station and turned himself in and was subsequently arrested.11 When Wilson was interviewed, he told police that he had been contemplating the idea of robbery over a number of days because of the financial hardship which he thought he was experiencing. He admitted that the machete that was used in this attempted robbery was his own. He told the police that after the attempted robbery he had thrown the machete away.12 The first principle that I must apply is the principle of parity. The co-offender Daniel Paul Wilson has pleaded guilty to the same charge as the present Offender and has been sentenced by his Honour Judge Sides on 10 December 2007. His Honour set a head sentence of three years and a non-parole period of twelve months. In accordance with the principle of parity, I cannot sentence the present Offender to any greater term.13 The present Offender shares, in many respects, common features with Daniel Paul Wilson.14 Firstly, he pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. Secondly, he has expressed remorse and contrition for his crime, and I accept that that contrition and remorse are genuine. It is clear from the evidence that Donley gave me that he was acutely aware of the terror which his activity may have struck in the victim of the attempted robbery and he has empathy for the plight of the victim.15 Like Wilson, Donley also made frank admissions to the police of his part in the crime and another mitigating factor is that the early plea of guilty saved the victim the anxiety of awaiting a trial and giving evidence in it.16 There is one further factor which applies to Donley that did not apply to Wilson. Donley cooperated with the police and identified his co-offender so that, had the co-offender not surrendered himself to police, the police could have arrested him and prosecuted him, and no doubt have turned to the Offender to give evidence against the co-offender. In other words, the present Offender, unlike his co-offender, gave assistance and cooperation to the police, which would have enabled the co-offender to be arrested had he not turned himself in.17 All those factors indicate that a discount of nearly fifty percent should be available to the present Offender of any sentence that ought be passed upon him.18 However, when I come to compare the criminality of the present Offender with the criminality of Wilson I find that there is a marked discrepancy and the criminality of Donley is less than that of his co-offender.19 The idea for the armed robbery was Wilson’s. Wilson had been contemplating it for a number of days. It was Wilson who raised it with Donley. Secondly, it was Wilson who armed himself with the machete, which was the aggravating factor under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. It was Wilson, not Donley, who confronted Mr Ly, who jumped the counter and attempted the robbery. The Offender merely stood in the background and, to use the old Australian vernacular, played the cockatoo.20 The Offender told me in his evidence on Friday that he did not wish to be there and I accept that evidence. I accept that he played a part in this attempted robbery reluctantly.21 Looking at comparative criminality, the proper sentence to pass on Mr Donley ought be a lesser sentence than the one that has been passed upon Wilson. What comes to my mind is a head sentence of two and a half years and a non-parole period of nine months.22 It must be remembered that the crime to which the Offender has pleaded guilty is a very serious one. That is reflected by the maximum penalty prescribed by Parliament, imprisonment for twenty years. However, the assault here is merely a putting of the victim in fear. Mr Meng Ly suffered no battery, to use the civil law expression, or to use the argot of the criminal law, did not suffer any bodily harm or wound.23 The personal circumstances of the Offender excite sympathy. The Offender was born on 2 February 1989 and is currently nineteen years old. At the time of the offence now in question he was eighteen years and one month old. The co-offender Daniel Paul Wilson was three months older than the present Offender. Both at the time of the offence and the time of the passing of this sentence, the Offender is a young man.24 The first part of the Probation and Parole Service pre-sentence report is in these terms: 
     
      
      “Mr Donley is eighteen years old and resides with his paternal aunt and uncle in the local area. Interview with the offender’s aunt indicates a warm, stable and supportive family environment. 
       
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Further discussions with Mr Donley’s aunt confirm that his childhood was marred by significant instability, characterised by violent domestic altercations perpetrated by his illicit drug-dependant mother. She further disclosed that following his parents’ separation at the age of eight, Mr Donley resided with his father before his father’s sudden decease two years later. Mr Donley reportedly lived for a short period with his mother, before residing permanently with his aunt and uncle.” 
      
    The only difference between that information and the evidence before me is that, immediately after his father’s unfortunate death, Donley went to reside with his aunt and uncle and it may be that he lived for a short period with his mother after the initial estrangement of his parents.25 The Offender completed the Higher School Certificate in, I infer, 2006. At the time he was interviewed by the Probation and Parole Service on 17 September 2007 the Offender had sporadic employment in various positions, including as a labourer and a factory hand. When giving evidence to me the Offender said that he had only recently been retrenched from a job two weeks ago, the retrenchment being due to a downturn in work. The Offender was driving a truck delivering air conditioning units in the local area.26 The Offender has before him two possible career paths. They are to play rugby league professionally or to obtain an apprenticeship in the building industry. According to both the Offender and his uncle, who gave sworn evidence, the Offender has a very promising career playing rugby league. However that career has been put on hold whilst the Offender awaits sentence.27 The Offender is currently playing for a club at East Hills and seeks to try out to join the Bulldogs team playing in the Under 21 competition, the Jim Beam Cup.28 The Offender does gym work on Mondays and Wednesdays and trains on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and obviously plays football at the weekend. Should the Offender not obtain a paid job as a rugby league player, he hopes to take up an apprenticeship.29 There are no drug issues involved in the present matter, which is somewhat unusual. However, there is a factor of alcohol being involved in this crime. 30 The Offender’s uncle told me that he suspected that the Offender was starting to binge drink, to take alcohol whilst under age, shortly after the Offender visited his mother when his mother was seriously ill in hospital. The Offender’s uncle, Mr Edwin Connor, made the point that the Offender was then sixteen years old. 31 I in fact sentenced the Offender’s mother on 18 September 2007. There was no objection taken to my dealing with the current Offender.32 In paragraph 31 of my reasons for judgment when passing sentence upon Kerry Ellen Donley I said this: 
     
      
      “As a result of her drug use, in August 2005 the offender went to hospital because, to use the words of the pre-sentence report, ‘All her organs had shut down due to extensive drug use’. The offender was in a coma for ten days but it appears that it may have been medically induced for the treatment of her various conditions. The appellant was not discharged from hospital until after three months of treatment.” 
      
     
     
      
    It would appear therefore that it was sometime in the three months between August and November of 2005 that the Offender visited his mother and that visit, or the effect of it upon the Offender, appears to have induced his turning to alcohol and to turn to binge drinking.33 One does not need expert evidence to appreciate that confronting the mother, from whom he had been estranged for some time, in such difficult circumstances would have been a psychological blow to the Offender and caused him to seek solace in the bottle.34 It was whilst having consumed excessive amount of alcohol that the Offender agreed to participate in Wilson’s proposal to attempt an armed robbery on the Pizza Hut at Lurnea.35 This brings me to another sentencing principle. At common law, the taking of drink was an aggravating factor, both in relation to mens rea and as to penalty. The maxim of the common law was qui peccat ebrius luat sobrius: he who misbehaves when drunk will pay for it when sober. In Sewell v R (1981) 5 A Crim R 204 after quoting the common law principle Zelling J continues thus: 
     
      
      “We have moved away from that concept as far as mens rea is concerned, but there are still many offences in which drink is an aggravation in relation to penalty. There are others in which it is not. For example a person under the influence of liquor who is otherwise of a blameless character may do something which is quite out of character and the liquor may be both an explanation and a factor in mitigation, but in other cases it may swing the penalty towards deterrence. In crimes of violence one may have some hope of putting rational arguments to deter a sober, would be assailant. That chance is much diminished if the assailant is under the influence of drink or drugs. Certainly an assault by a person under such influence is more frightening to the average person. Bray CJ said in Birch v Fitzgerald (1975) 11 SASR 114 at 116-117: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ‘Nevertheless there are offences in which, as it seems to me, the deterrent purpose of punishment must take priority. Where people act under the influence of liquor, passion, anger or the like so as to constitute themselves a physical danger or potential physical danger to other citizens, it may well be that a sentence of imprisonment will be appropriate, even in the case of a first offender of good character, in order to impress on the community at large that such behaviour will not be tolerated.’” 
        
       
      
    36 More recently Hunt J with whom Finlay and Allen JJ concurred in R v Coleman (1990) 47 A Crim R 306 said this: 
     
      
      “The degree of deliberation shown by an offender is usually a matter to be taken into account; such intoxication would therefore be relevant in determining the degree of deliberation involved in the offender’s breach of the law. In some circumstances, it may aggravate the crime because of the recklessness with which the offender became intoxicated; in other circumstances, it may mitigate the crime because the offender has by reason of that intoxication acted out of character.” 
      
    His Honour then referred with approval to the decision of the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in Sewell v R. 37 Here I accept on the evidence of both Mr Connor and the Offender that this offence was out of character. 38 The Offender has no criminal antecedents whatever and is therefore to be seen as a young man of good character.39 The Offender’s personal antecedents indicate why he turned to alcohol initially and the circumstances in which he came to use it, as a means to assuage the various vicissitudes of life.40 The Offender, I accept, was reluctant to join in Wilson’s plan, but did so under the influence of alcohol, under “Dutch courage”.41 In the circumstances, the acting out of character under the influence of alcohol can be seen in the special circumstances of this case to be a mitigating factor.42 Notwithstanding the sentence passed upon the co-offender, I have been eloquently urged by the Offender’s solicitor, Mr Croke, not to sentence the current Offender to full-time imprisonment. To do so I must find exceptional circumstances. 43 I have recently had cause to consider such submissions in R v Delaney (4 September 2007). Delaney pleaded guilty to three charges of armed robbery. Delaney’s part in each armed robbery was merely to drive the get-away car. Like Donley, Delaney was a very young man, and like Donley, the circumstances in which Delaney agreed to participate in the armed robbery were completely out of character, induced by certain emotional pressures which were on him at the time. Such emotional pressures were really psychological traumata.44 The present Offender is charged with a crime constituted by s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, which charge, as I have already stated, carries a maximum term of imprisonment of twenty years. 45 Armed robbery also carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. In R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 a majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal determined that a full-term sentence of between four and five years imprisonment was warranted in cases involving the following seven characteristics: firstly, a young offender with no or little criminal history; secondly, a weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; thirdly, a limited degree of planning; fourthly, limited, if any, actual violence, but a real threat thereof; fifthly, the victim was in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; sixthly, a small amount of money was taken; and lastly, a plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. Each of those elements is here present.46 In R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 it was said that R v Henry should be understood as involving a late plea of guilty for purposes of the application of the guilty plea guideline promulgated in Thomson itself.47 In R v Henry the Chief Justice said that non-custodial sentences for armed robbery should be “few and far between”. The Court of Criminal Appeal has repeatedly stated that a non-custodial sentence for offences of armed robbery can only be imposed in exceptional circumstances.48 The question which arises here, as it arose in Delaney is, are there exceptional circumstances? In my view there are.49 In R v Govinden (1999) 106 A Crim R 314 the respondent to the Crown appeal was eighteen years old at the time of the offences to which he pleaded guilty. One count was of being an accessory after the fact to armed robbery. Whilst on bail for the charge of being an accessory after the fact to armed robbery, the offender committed robbery in company. The trial judge imposed a sentence of 200 hours community service for the robbery in company and deferred sentence on the charge of being an accessory after the fact of armed robbery on the basis that the offender enter into a recognisance to be of good behaviour. The offender’s co-offender’s were juveniles at the time of the offences and were not sentenced to any custodial term.50 The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the Crown appeal. The judgment of the Court was given by Dunford J with whom James J and Smart AJ concurred.51 Commencing at [29], his Honour said this: 
     
      
      “It is well recognised that in dealing with young offenders, questions of general deterrence are of less importance than in the case of older offenders, and the rehabilitation of the offender is given a greater significance. This principle has recently been affirmed in Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at paragraph 9 to 10, one of the cases dealt with in the case of the guideline judgement of Henry earlier referred to. See also Tocknell v Farah (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 11 December 1998). But this respondent was aged eighteen and a half when the offences were committed and the principle is more commonly applied to offenders younger than that, and is not applied to offenders who commit crimes of the nature normally committed by adults, such as armed robbery: see Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135 referred to in Tran at paragraph 10 to 11. 
      
     
     
      
      In Maddocks, a case which bears some similarity to the present case, although the respondent was a couple of years older, the Court found that otherwise similar circumstances of this did not amount to the ‘most exceptional’ circumstances which would justify a non-custodial sentence, although in the exercise of its discretion, the Court decided not to interfere, in view of the progress and rehabilitation that had been made since the respondent had been dealt with in the District Court. 
       
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Another important case in this regard is Lattouf (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, number 60433 of 1996, 12 December 1996), which was another armed robbery case. It was also a Crown appeal and the respondent was a single man aged nineteen residing with his family which was described as warm and caring, and he had a good record of employment. In giving judgment Mahoney ACJ reaffirmed the seriousness with which the Court treats armed robbery, and it reiterated that it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that a non-custodial sentence will be imposed. 
       
        
       
      
     
     
      
      He pointed out that there is a public interest in the adoption and articulation of sentencing principles, which will deter the commission of serious crime and punish those who commit it. But his Honour went on to refer to the paramount objective of achieving justice in the individual case, and said (at pages 7-8): 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        ‘But, in addition, a sentencing process must be capable of discriminating between cases. There is, as I have said, a public interest in punishment. But if the desire to punish results in the person who would otherwise not become a confirmed criminal becoming such, that sentencing process is inconsistent with the public interest. It has to be recognised that imprisonment may convert a person, who will not be a persistent criminal, into one who is. Particularly is this so where the person to be sentenced is a first offender of a comparatively young age, whose family circumstances are such that he may, with assistance, not become a criminal. It would be wrong to the individual and costly to the community, not to attempt the rehabilitation of such a person.’ 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The appeal was dismissed, although the judgment of the differing members of the Court reflected some variation in thinking as to how that result should be achieved. 
      
     
     
      
      Sentencing judges must be vigilant to ensure that they do not accept uncritically at face value all submissions to the effect that the person sustaining the sentence is ‘at the crossroads’, ‘has seen the error of his way’, ‘is at a turning point in his life’, or, ‘has excellent prospects of rehabilitation’. Often such submissions have no justification in fact and are based on no more than wishful thinking, but there are exceptional cases where such submissions do have validity, and the Court should be astute to recognise them. I believe this is such a case even though, unlike Lattouf, this respondent was not a first offender at the time of the commission of the more serious offence.” 
      
    It is to be noted that in Govinden itself the primary or main offence was committed whilst the offender was at conditional liberty, which is an aggravating factor. Nevertheless the Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the non-custodial sentence imposed by the trial judge to stand. With respect, the present Offender’s case is more in line with Lattouf, which was cited with approval, than with Govinden itself.52 Another case which should be considered is R v Metcalf [2000] NSWCCA 277. There the offender was involved in five offences. In the first the offender entered the Quix Service Station at Lansvale in company. Metcalf had driven to the service station in his own car. He armed himself with a kitchen knife and in company with his co-offenders entered the service station. Metcalf held a knife to the unfortunate console operator at the station. Some $50 or $60 was stolen, as well as a magazine. The second offence was the same trio robbing a service station at Campbelltown. Again, Metcalf’s motor vehicle was used. Again, Metcalf armed himself with a knife and went into the service station. $670 in cash was stolen and $140 worth of cigarettes. The third offence was another armed robbery upon another service station at Lansvale. A small amount of cash was taken and some packets of cigarettes. The fourth offence involved a service station at Yagoona. Again, Metcalf and his two co-offenders entered the service station. One was armed with a baseball bat and the other with a knife. Whether Metcalf had one of the weapons, the judgment does not disclose. Money was taken from the till. The fifth offence involved robbery of a service station at Warwick Farm. The victim on that occasion was a female console operator. A threat was made by one of Metcalf’s co-offenders and the female service station operator handed over the money.53 The offender pleaded guilty. The offender was twenty years of age at the time. Judge O’Reilly sentenced Metcalf’s two co-offenders to imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of three years. However, his Honour sentenced Metcalf to a period of periodic detention for three years and the Crown appealed against the sentence.54 It can be seen that Metcalf’s offences were much more serious than Donley’s. 55 The Court of Criminal Appeal referred to a number of potent subjective features. Metcalf had suffered from schizophrenia since the age of thirteen. Fortunately Donley does not suffer from any psychiatric illness, as far as I am aware. Metcalf had agreed to give evidence on behalf of the Crown against his co-offenders. Here, Donley co-operated with the police and gave them information as to the identity of his co-offender, which would have enabled the co-offender to be arrested. Metcalf had been a drug user and had undergone psychiatric treatment after being charged. He provided thirty-six drug free urine specimens between the time of his arrest and the time of his sentence. Metcalf had obtained employment in the spare parts business in the southern suburbs and managed to change that employment from casual employment to full-time employment. In other words, Metcalf was undergoing rehabilitation. There was a suggestion also that the medication prescribed for Metcalf’s schizophrenia resulted in Metcalf’s having a lack of capacity to resist doing acts which he knew to be wrong. Donley cannot claim that. However, I do accept Donley was acting under the coaxing of his co-offender Wilson and was acting under the influence of liquor, to which I have already referred.56 The Court of Criminal Appeal also pointed out that persons of “tender years” suffering from psychiatric conditions find it notoriously difficult to cope in prison, which is a matter going to mitigation. If Metcalf at the age of twenty can be described as a man of tender years, so can Donley.57 Donley has spent sixty-nine days in custody. A number of those days in custody was at a metropolitan remand prison, the balance of it at Parramatta.58 Donley described his experience in gaol as “horrifying”. He saw a serious assault take place and heard rumours of others. He had fears for his own safety whilst in prison. He would have been one of the youngest prisoners in an adult institution in this State. Young offenders who go to prison full-time often need to seek protection from more experienced inmates, and then enter the university of crime and end up becoming criminals, as Mahoney ACJ pointed out in Lattouf.59 In my view this is one of those truly exceptional cases to which the authorities which I have cited refer. Here we have a man of unblemished good character in the past. His criminality is attenuated vis-a-vis that of the co-offender Wilson whose idea it was to attempt the robbery, who produced the knife and played the major role in the attempted robbery. The Offender was acting under the influence of alcohol but, in the special circumstance of this case, I have characterised that as a mitigating factor.60 The prospects of rehabilitation are excellent. The evidence for that is really that the Offender himself, but in particular that of his uncle who made the point that this offence was completely out of character but had the potential to ruin this young man’s life.61 Clearly a full-time custodial sentence would interrupt the Offender’s rugby league pathway for almost a year, and put him behind others in seeking an apprenticeship.62 I do not see any point to be served by putting Donley in gaol. It only has the potential of firstly physically and emotionally harming him, and of turning him from life of a law-abiding, worthwhile citizen to the life of a criminal.63 In R v Griggs (2000) 111 A Crim R 233 Simpson J said that a failure by a sentencing judge to give any consideration to available sentencing options, more lenient than full-time custody, which are canvassed in a pre-sentence report will manifest error in important respects. 64 Here the pre-sentence report raises questions of both periodic detention and community service. 65 In my view periodic detention here is inappropriate. Often prisoners are required to attend on Friday afternoons, which would interfere with the Offender’s quest for full-time employment, and certainly interfere with his rugby league career. True it is that mid-week periodic detention is available between Wednesdays and Fridays, but again, that would interfere both with the Offender’s seeking a full-time job or pursuing a professional rugby league career. Furthermore, periodic detention again would expose the Offender to the criminal milieu and, in any event it is proposed by the Executive that it be abolished.66 In my view community service is not as severe as the penalty which I think it appropriate to consider in this case.67 The other sentencing option available to me is a suspended sentence. The authorities make it clear that a suspended sentence is to be regarded as a real sentence and as punishment for the offence in question: R v JCE (2000) 120 A Crim R 18; R v Foster (2001) 33 MVR 565; R v Zamgias [2002] NSWCCA 17.68 In R v Laws [No. 2] (2000) 116 A Crim R 70 Wood CJ at CL said at paragraph 50: 
     
      
      “As is made plain in the second reading speech on 30 September 1999, when the option of suspended sentencing was introduced in this State, and as had earlier been made plain by Muirhead J in Darcy (1980) 2 A Crim R 254, their purpose is to convey the seriousness of the offence and the consequences of re-offending to the offender whilst also providing him or her with an opportunity to avoid the consequence by displaying good behaviour, and by not repeating the relevant breach of the law or any similar breach of the law.” 
      
    I intend to impose a suspended sentence. Donley needs to understand that if he fails to comply with the conditions of the bond which will require him, amongst other things, to be of good behaviour, then this Court will have no alternative other than to revoke the order for the suspension of the sentence, unless Donley is able, when called up, to satisfy the Court that any failure to comply with the bond was trivial in nature or that there were good reasons for such failure. If the bond is revoked then the Court has power, after hearing from the Offender, to determine the non-parole period which the Offender will have to serve, but the head sentence will remain, that fixed by the suspended sentence.69 The maximum term of a suspended sentence is two years imprisonment and I intend to impose that term of imprisonment.70 The pre-sentence report suggests that the Offender was suitable for a medium to low level of intervention by that Service and that an individualised case plan would include strategies to address the following identified areas of criminogenic need.71 Firstly, a psychological assessment and follow-up treatment as the pre-sentence report suggests that the Offender still suffers from unexpressed grief following from the death of his late father, when the Offender was ten years old. 72 The pre-sentence report also refers to drug and alcohol assessment, and that may be wise to impose. Accordingly it is my intention that during the period of the sentence the Offender be subject to the direction and supervision of the Probation and Parole Service.73 I should indicate that on the question of alcohol that the Offender has abstained from alcohol since this offence. He has become his family’s designated driver and regularly transports his friends and football colleagues around because he is the person who remains sober. In that regard he must consider what we all read about constantly in the press and hear on other forms of media, misbehaviour being perpetrated by sportsmen when under the influence of alcohol.74 I trust that this experience will have persuaded Donley to make sure that if he drinks alcohol in the future it is only in modest amounts.75 Raymond John Adam Donley, on the charge that you did on 7 March 2007 at Lurnea in the State of New South Wales attempt to rob Meng Sea Ly of certain property, namely a sum of cash money the property of Pizza Hut Pty Ltd, whilst being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a large knife or machete, you are convicted. 76 I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of two years. Under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I order that execution of the sentence be suspended. I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for a term of two years commencing today. 77 Conditions of the bond are as follows: firstly, that you appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond; secondly, that you are to be of good behaviour; thirdly, that you are to reside at 44 Kembla Crescent, Ruse or fourthly, to advise the Registrar of the Court by prepaid registered post of any change of residential address during the term of the bond; fifthly, that you be subject to direction and supervision of the Probation and Parole Service during the term of the bond.78 Mr Donley, do not nick off straight away. You need to go to the registry and sign the bond because theoretically you are in custody at the moment.79 Mr Donley, the term of the bond is two years. I cannot retire for another three and a half years and I do not have to retire for over fifteen years. If you breach the bond you will come back before me. I do not want to see you again Mr Donley, except on television playing footy.80 The back-up charge under s 114(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 is by consent dismissed.81 I add this to my reasons for sentence. I should indicate that I also accessed statistics available from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. Since the decision in R v Henry there have been 197 cases determined for an offence pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 18% to 19% of those committing crimes under s 97(1) have not been sentenced to full-time imprisonment, but to other forms of penalty. 2% of such criminals have been sentenced to suspended sentences and 8% have been sentenced to suspended sentences with supervision. When I factor in the circumstances personal to Donley there are eight cases. The personal circumstances are that there is only one count to which the Offender has pleaded guilty, that there is no Form 1 matter, that the Offender has no prior criminal record, that there is a plea of guilty, and that the Offender is aged between eighteen and twenty years. Of the eight cases that meet those criteria, only four have been sentenced to full-time imprisonment. One was given a s 9 bond with supervision. One was given a suspended sentence with supervision. Two were given periodic detention. Of the four who were sentenced to full-time imprisonment, the median head sentence was three years imprisonment and the median non-parole period twelve months imprisonment. It can be seen, therefore, that in the case of the co-offender Wilson, he obtained the median head sentence and the median non-parole period. However, the number of those not sentenced to full-time imprisonment is another factor which I have weighed and taken into account in passing the sentence which I have passed upon Donley.
