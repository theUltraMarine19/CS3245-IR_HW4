2705958,R v Hadchiti [2013] NSWSC 1726,"Judgment

 

1The accused pressed a tendency notice in relation to evidence proposed to be called as to the victim, Billy Mack's character, reputation or conduct and his tendency to:

 

""Engage in unlawful violent conduct towards females; to use weapons when engaging in unlawful violent conduct; and to carry a knife on his person.""

 

 

2There were finally only two issues lying between the parties as to the circumstances sought to be relied on. The first related to an incident in May 2002, when Billy Mack was engaged in a physical altercation with a juvenile, during which he elbowed an elderly lady in the head and the second related to an incident in 2008, when Billy Mack was involved in a car chase and reversed a motor vehicle into a police vehicle.

 

3Section 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 provides:

 

""97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.""

 

 

4I concluded that while the evidence as to the second matter could have significant probative value, that related to the first did not, even when considered with other evidence to be adduced.

 

5This conclusion rested on the following matters.

 

6The evidence was sought to be relied on in relation to the question of whether the accused was acting in self defence when the fatal wound was inflicted. ""Probative value"" is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as meaning 'the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.' As discussed by Simpson J in R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; (2005) 156 A Crim R 308 at [33]:

 

""(iv) the task that a trial judge undertakes under s97(1) involves a two-step process: firstly, the assessment of the extent to which the evidence in question has the capacity rationally to affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue; and, secondly, (where the judge concludes that the evidence has that capacity) an assessment and prediction of the probative value that the jury might ascribe to the evidence. The evidence is not to be admitted if the judge concludes that the evidence, either alone or in conjunction with other evidence already adduced or to be adduced, would not have significant probative value, i.e. if the judge concludes that the jury would not regard the evidence as having probative value, and to a significant degree (in the sense explained by Hunt CJ at CL in Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457). If the determination is that, notwithstanding that the evidence would have probative value, its probative value would not be significant, then the evidence is not admissible.""

 

 

7This exercise was further explained by Whealey J in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; (2012) 215 A Crim R 349 at [75] as:

 

""the task is to decide the capacity of the evidence, either by itself or having regard to other evidence of the kind mentioned in the section, to be significant (that is, to be of importance or of consequence) in establishing the fact or facts in issue.""

 

 

8So understood it was in my view apparent that the evidence as to the first matter did not have the capacity to be significant in establishing the facts in issue in this case. Billy Mack was then charged with offences of 'offensive manner' and 'resist or hinder police', but not with assault. The evidence was that the lady who he hit with his elbow and knocked over knew Billy Mack and declined to press any charges against him, because she considered that she had not been hit deliberately, but had been struck because she was in the way, Billy Mack having then been concerned for her son, who was being attended to by ambulance officers. The offences with which he was then charged, appeared to relate to other matters. Contrary to the accused's submission, it could not be concluded that this evidence had significant probative value. Even if it were accepted that the evidence had probative value, it would not be significant and was thus not admissible.

 

9I came to a different conclusion in relation to the second matter, where the evidence was that police had tried to stop a vehicle that Billy Mack was driving, which was carrying expired registration plates belonging to a different vehicle. When the vehicle was stopped at a traffic light and police officers alighted in order to direct him out of the vehicle, he reversed, ramming the police vehicle behind him, after which he drove off through a red traffic light. He eventually stopped and ran from police, who finally apprehended and restrained him, after a struggle, which necessitated the use of capsicum spray.

 

10Those matters, particularly the use of a motor vehicle as a weapon, in my view did have the capacity to be significant to establishing the facts in issue in this case, when considered together with the other tendency evidence as to which there was no issue between the parties. That is, I was satisfied that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of whether the accused was acting in self defence when the wound which led to Billy Mack's death was inflicted. Contrary to the Crown's submission, it had to be concluded that this evidence had significant probative value and was thus admissible.

2705961,Police v Rankin; Police v Roberts [2013] NSWLC 25,"Judgment
Reasons for Decision
1This is a case where the applicants were two of a crowd protesting against Coal Seam Gas (CSG) mining on the North Coast of New South Wales on 7 January 2013. They were each charged with two criminal offences (the original charges), and they pleaded not guilty to those charges. Those charges were then withdrawn, and a fresh single charge laid. They seek a permanent stay of the fresh proceedings against them. 

2This is also a case of firsts, at least for this court. This is the first time I have had an application for a stay of proceedings before me. It is the first time I have ever seen a charge of attempt relating to a summary offence. It is the first time I have seen a charge of attempt apply to an offence which is strict liability. It is the first time I have seen a charge of attempting to commit a traffic offence. It is the first time before me that the parties have agreed to a test case process, and the prosecution do not stick to their side of the bargain. It is the first time I have ever had the prosecution agreeing unequivocally, in writing, to withdraw charges against a defendant, only to have a further charge laid without effective notice. It is also the first time I have seen two prosecutors from the police involved with the one case, presumably instructed by the one informant. 

3This matter is unique in that there are multiple reasons pressed for a stay. In each of the reported decisions referred to below there is a sole basis for the application - breach of an agreement, collateral purpose, vexatious prosecution, or failure to comply with court directions. In the final paragraph of this judgment I order the stay as sought by the defendants. That is not for any single one of the factors or issues discussed below. It is the combination of those matters, excluding the collateral purpose, that leads to this conclusion. 

4This judgment is divided into the following subheadings:
Factual Background
Procedural Background
Maclean Local Court
Legal Issues:

Seriousness of the Offence
Wasted Court Time
Detriment Suffered by the Defendants
The Bargain Issue
Collateral Purpose
The Vexatious Argument
Prosecutorial Discretion
Findings and Orders

5In determining this matter I have taken into account the motion, the evidence for the applicants, the court papers including my notes in the case of Medek and the oral and written submissions of the parties. I note that the prosecution did not file any evidence in the matters. 

Factual Background
6The applicants were two of a group of protesters at a CSG mining site near the small hamlet of Glenugie between Grafton and the sea. I have not been provided with a copy of the facts for each matter, however I gather from the submissions that one of the applicants was sitting on the road, and the other had locked himself onto something with a view to making his removal more challenging should he decide not to move when requested. There were many others on the road protesting. Some moved when asked. Others remained and were arrested. Each of the applicants was arrested and charged with two offences.1 The first was the offence Hinder Police pursuant to s 564C of the Crimes Act 1900. The second was pursuant to r 236(2) of the Road Rules 2008:
""A pedestrian must not unreasonably obstruct the path of any driver or another pedestrian""

7They were arrested and taken to Grafton Police Station. They were released on police bail some hours later, which required them not to return within 3km of the protest site, and to appear in court on the listing day of their matter. 

8There were many others arrested around the same time as this and at other sites. Some refused to enter their bail and were remanded bail refused. Others refused to enter the police bail and were released once they appeared at court on a variation of bail. Many pleaded guilty, and were dealt with by way of s 10 dismissal, s 10 bond or fine. A significant number pleaded not guilty. The applicant Roberts resides at Bentley, approximately 150km from Grafton. He has appeared in court to answer his bail on at least three occasions. The applicant Rankin resides at Engadine which I believe is a suburb in Sydney. This is approximately 650km from Grafton. He has appeared in court to answer his bail on four occasions. 

Procedural Background
9On 11 March 2013 all not-guilty matters were listed before me for mention to set a date for hearing at Grafton Local Court, a brief having been served in most. A proposal was put by the prosecution and defence: rather than listing all matters for hearing, the suggested agreed plan by both parties was that two of these cases, those of the applicants, would be set down for hearing on a test-case basis. This was because the issues in these cases were typical of the issues in other cases. There were a large number of witnesses required for both the prosecution and defence case, and for listing reasons, they were set down for hearing as a special fixture at Maclean Local Court on 9 and 10 July for two days hearing. Nothing else was listed for hearing as these matters were most likely to go ahead. With the exception of the matters of Medek, Giallard and Zable, and where defendants pleaded guilty, all other matters arising from this protest, and a later protest at Doubtful Creek, were adjourned awaiting the determination of the test cases. 

10In the meantime, there were three other cases set down for hearing, those of Mr Medek, Mr Giallard and Mr Zable. They were set down for hearing earlier than the test matters as they were only likely to take two hours in total, and thus could be allocated a sooner hearing time. They were heard on 7 May 2013. In both these cases the charges were dismissed, and the issues traversed those of the applicants' test cases. Accordingly, it is important to revisit those cases. 

11Mr Medek's case went first. He too was charged with the same offences as those in the test cases. Senior Sergeant Huxtable was for the prosecution, and Mr Bolt for the defence. The defence focussed their cross-examination on two aspects - the lack of compliance by the informant with s 201 of Law Enforcement Police Responsibilities Act 2002 (LEPRA), and the lack of any motor vehicles actually being present at the time of the arrest. 

12On both issues the evidence was clear and uncontroversial. The informant, an officer from the specialist Public Order and Riot Squad (who had travelled to the protest site from Sydney, and had travelled to Grafton Court for the hearing from Sydney) had not complied with s 201 in both technical and substantive ways. In particular, he had not warned the defendant that if he did not move he could be arrested. Whilst I do not have a transcript of the judgment I gave, I made it clear that such a direction was crucially important in a protest situation because there are those who may not want to get arrested, and would use such a warning as an opportunity to comply. Given that breach of s 201, I was not satisfied that the informant was acting in the execution of his duty, and that charge was dismissed. The legal basis of that determination is well established by authority of the High Court and the Supreme Court of New South Wales: the High Court considered this issue specifically in Coleman v Power and Ors [2004] HCA 39 per McHugh at [118]. This was applied in NSW in the case of Semaan v Poidevin [2013] NSWSC 226.

13Incidentally, the latter case has now been successfully appealed by the DPP (Poidevin v Semaan [2013] NSWCA 334), however the principal issue of import to this case was reinforced by the Court of Appeal at [118]:
The Crown Advocate, who appeared for the applicant, accepted that ""in the execution of his or her duty"" meant ""in the lawful execution of his or her duty"". That approach was correct, and accords with what McHugh J said (of the materially identical Queensland counterpart to s 546C) in Coleman v Power [2004] HCA 39; (2004) 220 CLR 1 at [117] that ""It is not part of an officer's duty to engage in unlawful conduct.""

14On the second issue, the evidence was not contentious that the actions of the defendant did not block any vehicles, as the mining rig and trucks were still some miles away, and the police were seeking to clear the road prior to their arrival. Accordingly, the traffic matter was also dismissed. This decision was given ex tempore, and the prosecution have not appealed. 

15The prosecution conceded that in relation to Mr Zable and Mr Gaillard the same issues arose and tendered the brief in both matters. Senior Sergeant Huxtable conceded that in both cases s 201 of LEPRA had not been complied with and there were no vehicles present to be obstructed. The charges were dismissed. 

16Costs were not sought by the defence. Senior Sergeant Huxtable agreed to look at all the other matters in the light of the findings of the court in the Medek matter. As a result, some of the defendants pleaded guilty in the preceding weeks, and in the other matters the defence made representations to have the charges withdrawn. 

17In the Local Court, charges are usually withdrawn following representations to the Regional Commander. These are made in writing, and involve consultation with a local senior prosecutor, and the informant. This usually takes approximately six weeks. 

18The defence made representations with respect to the applicants' cases at the invitation of Senior Sergeant Huxtable, and the basis of the representations were that LEPRA had not been complied with. A copy of the representations is an attachment to the affidavit of Mr Bolt, Solicitor. The Patrol Commander wrote back to the applicants' lawyers on 4 July 2013 stating that the charges were to be withdrawn. The letter specifically refers to the ""H number"" which corresponds with the two charges for each of the applicants in these matters. The prosecution did not notify the court of this decision. 

19As a result of that letter, Mr Wykeham, a Solicitor in the employ of Mr Bolt, notified the defendants that their charges were to be withdrawn. He also called off witnesses, and counsel, Mr Cochrane. 

20On Friday 5 July 2013 (when the test cases had been set for the following Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr Bolt received a telephone call from Senior Sergeant McMahon, who informed him of a fresh charge. He informed Mr Bolt that he was driving up from Sydney to take carriage of the matters. Mr Wykeham of Mr Bolt's office then sought a copy of the new CAN from the police, but despite requests on 5 July 2013 and 8 July 2013, none were provided. Until their arrival at Maclean Court on 9 July 2013 the applicants did not know the particulars of the new charge that they would be facing, and despite their best efforts had not been able to obtain a copy from the police. 

21That is unsurprising because, the fresh charge was not laid electronically until 8 July 2013, the day before a two-day hearing, for offences which had allegedly occurred on 7 January 2013. There is a six-month limitation period on traffic matters. So the fresh charge was laid on the very last possible day. 

Maclean Local Court
22On 9 July 2013, Senior Sergeant Huxtable rose and withdrew the original charges. The defence said that they had no objection to the charges being withdrawn, and that they had intended to make no application for costs, but that in the light of what they anticipated was about to occur, that their position on costs was now reserved. 

23A different prosecutor rose, Senior Sergeant McGrath. He stated that a single further charge had been laid against each of the test case defendants (the present applicants), and all other remaining defendants of ""attempt block road"". Mr Cochrane of Counsel for the defendants said that he had got wind that this may occur, which is why he had attended court. He indicated that his solicitor and his clients had not been served the fresh charge, which he believed may be out of time. He wanted to see the fresh CANs, including proof of the date on which they had been filed. The prosecution wanted to press on with the matters but conceded that would not be possible. The defence sought an adjournment. The basis of this adjournment application was that this was effectively the first time these matters were before the court, that the defence witnesses had been called off on the basis that the charges were to be withdrawn, that the defence needed to investigate whether the charges were in time (being laid on the last day of the six month limitation period), to get instructions, and to undertake research on the issue of attempting a summary offence. The prosecution had not served the defence team or the applicants the new charges, and also had not notified the court. 

24I granted the adjournment, and ordered costs against the prosecution for the day in the sum of approximately $2,000. 

25The costs issue is, as discussed below, of import. It shows that the defendants have privately engaged and retained solicitors and counsel to represent them in the original matters and the fresh charges. It can be inferred that they have already, as a result of the mentions, representations, conferences, briefing, obtaining statements and advising on the original matters, incurred significant expense. Whether the police compensate them for those expenses, or they suffer that loss as they had intended on the withdrawal of the original matters, is not yet determined. The current status is that they are responsible for those costs. I have not heard an application for those costs. The defence would have the significant hurdle of the onus on the defence under s 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

26It is worth noting that on 12 July 2013 Mr Wykham requested copies of the fresh charges from the prosecutor's office at Lismore, Grafton police station, and the brief handling manager at Coffs Harbour. He did not receive copies of the fresh charges. He then wrote to the Local Area Commander at Coffs Harbour requesting a copy of the charges and evidence of when they were filed. He did not receive a copy of the fresh charges until 5 August 2013. 

27I also took some time to consider the court's position in relation to the fresh charges. I directly asked Mr McGrath as to why the fresh charge had been laid, especially given the minor nature of the charge, the delay, the waste of court time for the days set aside, the withdrawal of the previous charges and the expense of having witnesses and defendants attend court. His answer was one word: ""instructions"".

28I should add that it is not usual for this court to challenge the prosecution so bluntly as to the reason for a prosecution. That is not a matter which commonly concerns the court. However, where two days of precious court time is wasted by prosecutorial manoeuvring, at the time I thought it a valid enquiry. 

29Eventually, once the prosecution actually served a copy of the fresh CAN to the defence solicitors, this stay application was made by the applicants in relation to the fresh attempt charge.

30The fresh charge in relation to the applicant Roberts reads (verbatim):
""Between 9.50 am and 11.30 am on 07/01/2013 at GLENUGIE. did travel on a road, to wit, The Avenue, Glenugie, and did unreasonably obstruct the path of a driver the said Allan Roberts being a pedestrian. attempt to commit""

31The fresh charge in relation to the applicant Rankin is for relevant purposes the same. 

Legal Issues
32It is agreed by both parties that the Local Court has the power to stay proceedings: DPP v Shirvanian (1998) 44 NSWLR 129 at 135 per Mason J. It is often stated by the higher courts that there are discernible classes of cases in which a power of stay has been exercised, but that the classes are not closed and that it is necessary to consider the individual factual scenario in the particular case: Hunter v Chief Constable of West Midlands [1981] UKHL 13. There are two broad categories of cases where there is a power to stay. The first is where the prosecution of proceedings are oppressive and thus unfair. The second is where there is an abuse of process that the court ought to protect itself from. These two categories are not exclusive, and clearly overlap - the cases in respect of the second category, also include reference to an erosion of public confidence in the courts where the conduct of one party leads to oppression and/or injustice. In essence the question to ask is whether the procedure would bring the court into disrepute among right thinking people. 

33A passage oft-quoted in the leading cases relating to stay in criminal prosecution is from the New Zealand case of Moevao v Department of Labour [1980] 1 NZLR 464. Richardson J commented at 482:
The justification for staying a prosecution is that the court is obliged to take that extreme step in order to protect its own processes from abuse. It is done so in order to prevent the criminal process from being used for purposes alien to the administration of criminal justice under law. It may intervene in this way if it concludes from the conduct of the prosecutor in relation to the prosecution that the court processes are being employed for ulterior purposes or in such a way (for example through multiple or successive proceedings) as to cause improper vexation and oppression. The yardstick is not simply fairness to the particular accused. That may be an important consideration. But the focus is on the misuse of the court process by those responsible for law enforcement. It is whether the continuation of the prosecution is inconsistent with the recognised purposes of the administration of criminal justice and so constitutes abuse of the processes of the court.

34Thus the courts will intervene where a criminal prosecution is instituted for a collateral purpose. In Williams v Spautz (1992) 174 CLR 509 a university professor instituted a private criminal prosecution which was stayed on the basis that it was instituted primarily to advantage negotiations in seeking reinstatement of his employment. 

35In Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378, Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ also referred to the passage from the judgment of Richardson J with approval. Their Honours made the following remarks at 392 which are of general application:
The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court, which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality, may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness.

36The onus is on the applicant, and it is a particularly heavy one: Williams v Spautz (1992) 61 ACrimR 43 at 519 and 529. As was said in R v Mohi [2000] SASC 384 at [29]:
The critical question is whether the interests of justice demand that the power to stay the prosecution be exercised. The fairness of a trial is only one factor of many which bear upon those interests. The onus of satisfying the court that an abuse exists lies upon the party alleging it. That onus is a heavy one and the power to grant a permanent stay ""is one to be exercised only in most exceptional circumstances"" (Williams v Spautz at p 529.)

37The onus on the applicant is on the balance of probabilities; however, the onus is higher than the civil standard, in that the court must be actually persuaded, rather than one inference being stronger than the other: Brown v NSW Trustee and Guardian [2012] NSWCA 431 at [52]. 

Seriousness of the Offence
38The respondent prosecution submits at paragraph 42 that there is little room for consideration of the nature of the fresh charges laid: 
The prosecution do not agree that the ultimate question in this case involves consideration of the seriousness of the alleged offending conduct. The seriousness of the offences in question is for these purposes irrelevant. The focus is on preventing an abuse of the courts processes and/or unfairness to an accused. In this context the court would no more sanction such an abuse in the case of murder than it would for an allegation pursuant to the innocuous r236 of the Road Rules 2008.

39The use of the word ""innocuous"" is telling. It means ""harmless"" and serves to emphasise the minor nature of the charge, let alone an attempt of same. 

40The defence takes a different view at paragraph 37:
Given that the test in this application is a balancing one, as the seriousness of the alleged criminal conduct falls, so too does the nature and extent of oppressive or other abusive conduct that will be required before a stay is the appropriate remedy.

41In my opinion the defence view is correct, although I could find no authority either way. Perhaps that is because the reported decisions are generally on serious criminal matters. However, there is some authority that points in the direction of the defence submissions. In Rogers v R (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 5, Mason CJ described the balancing test as follows: 
...the requirement of fairness to the accused, the legitimate public interest in the disposition of charges of serious offences and in the conviction of those guilty of crime and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. (my emphasis) 

42In considering the balancing test, the public interest in prosecuting crime is different in proceedings of different types. Thus the public interest in the conviction of perpetrators of offences of violence or serious property crime, will be much greater than prosecuting a person for failing to indicate. This also accords with general principal. In a case where the prosecution seeks an adjournment as a key witness is not present, the court weights up a number of factors. Not adjourning the matter will mean that the prosecution case will fail and the charges will be dismissed - a result with the same effect as a permanent stay. One of the key factors that the court looks to is the seriousness of the allegations against the defendant. Similarly, when the court is considering the admission of illegally or improperly obtained evidence under s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 the court considers the seriousness of the case, in accordance with common law principals. Again, the failure to allow the evidence may lead to the charges being dismissed - a result with the same effect as a permanent stay. In each of these examples - adjournments and admissibility - the court is exercising discretion, and the seriousness of the offence is a key factor to consider in the exercise of that discretion. In my view, this application also requires a discretionary decision, and the seriousness or innocuousness of the charge is similarly a key factor. 

43Not only is this case minor, it is appropriate to look at the likely penalty if the applicants were found guilty. Obviously, the maximum penalty is a fine. However, the court would need to further take into account some additional factors that would mitigate any penalty. Firstly, the applicants have spent a significant amount on costs on matters where the charges have been withdrawn. They may or may not recover these. Second, the applicants were on bail for some six months for charges that were withdrawn. Third, the applicants reside at Bentley and in Sydney. According to the papers, they have travelled to court on several occasions to meet their bail conditions. Fourth, the penalty for an attempt offence will generally be less than for the substantive offence.2 Fifth, the prosecution have delayed prosecuting the current matters for six months. Sixth, the applicants were advised that the charges were to be withdrawn, and then had to face other matters which certainly took them and their legal representatives by surprise. Seventh, each of the applicants was arrested, taken back to Grafton police station and then released on bail. In other cases submissions were made about the time in custody being taken into account, and in some of those the processing and release was delayed for many hours. Eighth, the applicants would have a legitimate expectation that their penalty would be somewhat less than the others who have been penalised for the more serious offence of resist police. 

44I note that pursuant to the State Debt Recovery Office Fixed Penalty Handbook, a breach of this Road Rule carries a fine of $67 if dealt with by a ticket. Innocuous indeed. 

45Each of these factors would tend to indicate that the applicants would be unlikely to be fined an amount anywhere close to the maximum penalty. So, not only are the charges minor, the likely penalty even assuming convictions are likely to be insignificant. In my view this is a key factor in determining whether a stay ought be granted. 

Wasted Court Time
46The prosecution had two days of hearing time set aside for them to prove their case. They did not notify the court that the charges were to be withdrawn. They did not notify the court that a fresh charge was to be laid. Their attempt to have the fresh charge litigated at Maclean was futile, as the defendants had relieved their witnesses, and rightly required time to research the unique new charges laid. 

47The courts are not the protectors of the public purse, but it is appropriate that the court considers its resources in determining a stay. The prosecution is under an obligation to comply with the Chief Magistrate's practice direction (Local Court Practice Note Crim 1 at 6.1 and 6.2) with respect to vacating a hearing date, and they did not. That requires the prosecution to make an application to vacate prior to 21 days prior to the hearing. If an unforeseen circumstance arises within that 21 days, then the application is to be made no later than the next working day. The purpose of this direction is obvious - if the prosecution do not notify the court of their intentions to vacate a hearing then court time is thrown away. I travelled from Ballina Court solely for this hearing. The court staff came from Grafton. It is worth remembering that people sit in prison awaiting a hearing day in the local court and they, as well as alleged victims, are among those who suffer as a result of this sort of manoeuvring by the prosecution. 

48The case of Gaby Rona v District Court of South Australia and Ors (1995) 63 SASR 223 is most persuasive on this issue. In that case, the South Australian DPP had failed to comply with a practice direction, and accordingly the matter could not proceed to trial. The trial judge stayed the proceedings. His decision was overturned on appeal and the matter remitted, on the basis that his orders were clearly to punish the DPP, rather than applying the correct criteria on a stay application. However, the Supreme Court emphasised that court management of its resources was an appropriate matter to consider in a stay application. King CJ at [15] found:
I consider therefore that the conduct by the DPP of a prosecution other than in accord with the procedural directions given by the court or the undertakings and assurances given to the court may amount to an abuse of process of the court and found the jurisdiction to stay the proceedings. If that were not so, the DPP would be immune from the case management regime and the power of a court to control its own process and proceedings, Jago v District Court of NSW per Gaudron J at P74, would be defeated. 

49At [22] King CJ found:
I think that the attempt by the DPP to depart from the unequivocal assurances given at the status conference that the information on which the accused would go to trial.....was in the circumstances an abuse of the process of the court which gave rise to a power in the court to stay proceedings on that information.

50Earlier in this judgement I referred to the balancing process required. At [26] King CJ found that part of that process involves consideration: 
...(of the) integrity of the case management system and all that it implies for the efficient and just disposal of criminal business and the community's expectation that persons who are charged with offences are properly brought to trial.

51My conclusion on this issue is that the prosecution have wasted significant court resources in their conduct of this matter, and that this is a factor in weighing up whether to stay the proceedings. It ought be noted that the defence also have an obligation in these circumstances to have notified the court. However, primary responsibility rests with the prosecution given that they are the initiators of the original proceedings, it was their decision to withdraw those proceedings, and to institute the fresh proceedings. 

Detriment Suffered by the Defendants
52The defendants agreed to participate in the test case on the basis that they would have their cases delayed, remain on bail, and defer an option of an early plea with the discount that may apply. This is submitted by the defence at paragraph seven, and is not contested by the prosecution.

53I note further that it is not just the applicants who have suffered delay as a result. Mr Bolt and Mr Wykham in their affidavits attest to the large number of other people who have had their cases adjourned from other courts and other protests awaiting the outcome of the test case. They too have suffered detriment as a result of the delay. 

The Bargain Issue
54The defence contend that the prosecution have broken a bargain and that this constitutes a basis for a stay. Firstly, the defence state that the prosecution, by agreeing to the test case process, agreed to be bound by the decisions in those cases - paragraphs 9 and 31 of the applicants' submissions. Second, the applicants contend that the prosecution, in writing to withdraw the charges, agreed in effect to end the prosecution of the defendants. 

55On the first issue, the prosecution submits at 34 that there was no legal obligation formed by running a test case, and lists authorities at 35 where a promise of non-prosecution followed by a prosecution has not led to a stay. Mohi is an example where a stay was granted. Each of those cases relate to where the promisee is at first a witness, and then becomes a defendant. Here, it is quite clear what the promise was, and indeed until the intervention of the laying of fresh charges, the process was running as all parties thought that it would. The case of Medek resolved the legal issues and the parties accepted the legal findings of the court. Some defendants pleaded guilty, others made representations as invited to by the prosecution, including these two applicants. It was a legitimate expectation that the prosecution would abide by the test case determination, even if the Medek matter was not expected to be the test case. 

56On the second issue, the prosecution submits at 10:
...that this (the fresh charge) occurred in the context of these applicants having been notified that the proceedings were being discontinued is unfortunate.

57The wording of that submission is important in my view. There is no pretence that the applicants were notified that just some charges were to be withdrawn. The word used is ""proceedings"". This acknowledges that the intention was to convey that the criminal prosecution of the applicants by the police, in its totality, would cease. 

58""Unfortunate"" means as a result of bad luck. There was nothing unfortunate about it at all - there was a clear decision by someone other than the Local Area Commander and the senior prosecutor for this region to lay another charge, thereby reneging on a test case agreement that had been made between the parties and in the face of the court. 

59In my view the two issues cannot be viewed in isolation. The adoption of a test case process does imply that the parties will accept the outcome of the decision in those cases insofar as they relate to the other cases. The test cases were dismissed following the prosecution inviting the applicants to make written representations. After Medek they were foredoomed to fail. Therefore the prosecution ought be bound by their bargain. Once that was done, and the letter was sent indicating that the charges in the test cases would be withdrawn, there existed a further implication - that a fresh charge would not be laid. As the defence correctly assert in their submissions: 
At no stage before 5 July 2013 did the prosecution suggest that alternative charges may be laid, either in the event police failed in relation to r236 or s546C charges, or otherwise in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.

60It goes without saying that there is clearly a high degree of trust between the defence lawyers and the prosecutor Senior Sergeant Huxtable. They work together on a daily basis, and the arrangement that was struck in relation to the test cases no doubt would have been kept had it been left in his hands. 

61The law on this issue is somewhat obscure, as most of the cases involve the police or other prosecuting authorities in a bargain not to charge a person at all, and then charging them. In New South Wales, the matter has been considered by the Court of Appeal in Nolan v Curby [1995] NSWCA 324, a decision of Clarke JA (Powell JA and Cole JA agreeing). This case was referred to in R v Mohi [2000] SASC 384 (8 November 2000), a case referred to in submissions. In Nolan, the court referred to a number of relevant decisions, which establish the following principals. 

62Firstly, the prosecution of a person who had received a promise, undertaking or representation from the police that they will not be prosecuted is capable of being an abuse of process: R v Croydon Justices, ex parte Deane [1993] 3 All ER 129.

63Second, a stay is not limited to where a defendant has provided information to the police on a promise of non-prosecution: R v Trainor (1991) 56 A Crim R 102. In that case, the prosecution sought an adjournment which was opposed by the defendant, as the defendant's key witness was about to leave the state. The court refused the application for an adjournment. The defendant agreed to a deal with the prosecution whereby if the charges were not proceeded with he would not seek costs against the prosecution. The police offered no evidence and the defendant was discharged. Dowsett J found that the bargain included a mutual intention that all proceedings would therefore be at an end, even though the agreement did not state as much, referring only to ""the charge"". Some months later, the defendant was charged with different offences relating to the same incident. The court stayed the prosecution, commenting: 
Nothing is more likely to bring the judicial process into disrepute than to permit either the Crown or the police force to resile from such an agreement I consider that the subsequent proceedings constituted an abuse of process.

64Of course not every determination to reverse a decision by the police or the DPP would lead to such a conclusion. For example, where there is fresh evidence, one could imagine that such a decision would not be regarded as undermining public confidence in the administration of justice, and, therefore, as an abuse of process: Barac v Director of Public Prosecutions; Barac v Stirling [2007] QCA 112.

65Third, the categories of situations where a prosecution will be stayed are not closed: R v Vuckov and Romeo (1986) 40 SASR 498 at 521, where Cox J noted that cases from a number of jurisdictions:
... show on the whole a cautious but steady development in recent years of the use of a stay of proceedings on the criminal side as a remedy against prosecutorial oppression in a variety of situations. They are not all concerned with the manner of a man's trial, but extend to the question whether he should be tried at all. There can be no set categories of cases that call for the exercise of this drastic but necessary power.

66Fourth, the bargain may not relate to criminal charges, but to the giving of evidence. The Court in Croydon placed considerable reliance upon the decision of the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in Chu Piu-wing v Attorney-General [1984] HKLR 411. The Court of Appeal set aside a subpoena to a witness as an abuse of process because officers of the Independent Commission Against Corruption had previously enlisted the witness' assistance on the basis of an undertaking by the officers that the witness would not be required to give evidence. The Court observed (pp 417 and 418):
We think that there is a clear public interest to be observed in holding officials of the State to promises made by them in full understanding of what is entailed by the bargain.

67Fifth, the bargain need not have been made to the court, but may have been made only between the parties. As the court said in Mohi at [38]:
Support for the appellant's case is also found in two Canadian decisions. In R v Betesh (1975) 30 CCC (2d) 233, contrary to an undertaking by the Federal Attorney-General that postal workers would not be prosecuted for criminal offences committed during a postal strike, a postal worker was charged by the State authorities with assault in connection with an incident that occurred during the strike. In upholding an application for a stay of the prosecution, the judge of the County Court in Ontario expressed the following opinion (p 251):
""The abuse [of the process of the Court] lies in the Crown reneging on an agreement made and presented to a Court. To renege on such an agreement constitutes an abuse of the process of the Court. The Crown is expected to honour the agreements it has made in relation to prosecutions.""
To this I would add that the Crown is expected to honour such agreements whether presented to the court or otherwise...

68Sixth, a change of personnel in the prosecution ranks will not relieve the new prosecutor from the promises of the old: Mohi again at [39]: 
In R v Crneck, Bradley and Shelley (1980) 116 DLR (3d) 675, Krever J of the Ontario High Court granted a stay in respect of an applicant who had given a statement following an undertaking provided by Crown counsel, who then had the conduct of the case, that the statement would not be used against her and that if the statement was consistent with the known facts, the applicant would not be tried but would be called as a witness. Subsequently a different Crown counsel determined that, contrary to the earlier undertaking, the applicant should be charged.
In granting the stay, Krever J observed that there was ""considerable merit"" in the proposition that to allow the Crown to renege on an agreement to extend immunity from prosecution to an applicant in return for the cooperation of that person, which cooperation was given, would undermine the administration of justice and bring the entire system of the administration of justice into disrepute. His Honour referred to the principle that agreements made by a representative of the Attorney-General after consideration and consultation with experienced police officers should be carried out. However, his Honour found it was unnecessary to decide whether such principles prevailed because he reached the view that, if the Crown was permitted to withdraw from the agreement, the conduct of the Crown would have caused serious prejudice to the applicant in her defence of the charge. His Honour concluded that the cumulative effect of the prejudice and the principle that the Crown must be expected to carry out its agreement was sufficient to bring the case within the category of ""most exceptional circumstances"" which justified the granting of the permanent stay.

69This point is reinforced in the judgment in the case of Mohi itself. The court accepted that there was, as a question of fact, no certainty in the position of the DPP regarding immunity from prosecution. However, that was not communicated to the defendant. Accordingly, the court found as follows at [46]: 
In my opinion, it is no answer to the cumulative force of these facts to say that those concerned with the prosecution of Williams and Herbsach within the Office of the Director had not finally decided whether the applicant was to be a witness or an accused. If of any significance, the fact that consideration was first given to this issue in April 1999, but was not resolved in the mind of those making the decision until February 2000, supports the case for the applicant. From the perspective of the accused and the community, the reassurances given by the investigating officers that the applicant would not be charged were confirmed and adopted by the conduct of the Director through his officers. That adoption came in a number of forms and over a lengthy period. No change in circumstances occurred which could amount to good reason for a change in the ostensible position previously taken by the Director.

70Again, it is relevant that in the present case, the prosecution has elected to give no evidence as to why there has been a change in prosecutorial position. 

71In Visser v Hodgetts [2002] TASSC 44 the defendant asked for and received a commitment to withdraw two charges of assault. Fourteen days later, the police changed their mind. The matter was not at that time set down for hearing, the charge was the same as before, there was no test case agreement, there was no wasted court time, there was no witness difficulty, there were no costs implications, there would be no delay as a result and the charges were far more serious. The prosecutor claims that this case has significant similarities to the one at hand - I disagree. It is unsurprising that a bare single promise breached would not lead to a stay. 

72The respondent states that there has been no forensic disadvantage identified by the withdrawal of one charge and the laying of another in breach of the test case agreement. The submissions at 40 go on to state:
Furthermore, it is not appropriate to describe what occurred as a promise, it is in fact not even capable of being described as a representation by the prosecution....The prosecution simply and presumably went along with what had been suggested by the applicants. To have done otherwise would have been unreasonable given the process was likely suggested informally as a way of expediting resolution. Essentially what is being suggested is that the prosecution should not have agreed to the test case process in the expectation that they would or might encounter difficulties in proving the original charges and that by so doing they had tied their hands in perpetuity.

73That submission is, in my view, in error. To participate in a test case scenario is a promise. It does tie the party's hands. There is no evidence as to who instigated the test case process. The affidavit of Mr Bolt simply states that it was agreed by Mr Cochrane of Counsel and by Senior Sergeant Huxtable. That agreement was then put by the parties to the court for its approval. The court then approved it. 

74The last sentence in the quote above is confusing. If it is meant to suggest that the prosecutor erred in entering into the agreement, then that is something that can be sorted out between the Senior Sergeants. If it is meant to suggest that a test case approach, approved by the court, is simply a tactic for forensic advantage as the case ebbs and flows, I disagree. Again, by opting to put on no evidence whatsoever from the informant, the respondent is left with no evidence as to the reasoning for the apparent change of heart. 

75In Mohi, the absence of a good reason was a key factor in staying the proceedings (at [48]). The prosecution in this case is expected to honour such agreements, and the failure to do so gives rise to a power to stay. 

76At paragraph 41, the prosecutors submissions read: 
There was no written agreement setting out any terms, at best there was an indication that the cases would be ""looked at"" with no further explanation

77The time being referred to in that submission was after the case of Medek. However, that is not the agreement which is crucial. The important agreement is that the applicant's matters were set down for hearing on a test case basis. The prosecution lost. Whether that was because of another court case or not is irrelevant. Whether that occurred because the cases were withdrawn, or were dismissed following a hearing is irrelevant. 

78At paragraph 41 the prosecution submits: 
In no way did any of the prosecution conduct amount to a promise that the applicants would only be charged with these offences or that the prosecution might not be amended if the need arose.

79The obvious terms of an agreement to enter into a test case are that those charged with some offences will be tried on those offences. The test cases were withdrawn because they were foredoomed to fail because they relied on the same issues as the case of Medek. After all, what is the purpose of having a test case agreement, and when the test case fails, or as in this case is withdrawn, then the prosecution does not stick to its test case agreement? Senior Sergeant McMahon's version of a test case agreement seems to be that if the cases are looking shaky then the prosecution can lay an alternative charge instead. 

80The test case was not an agreement made solely by the parties. It was made in open court and was approved by the court. The whole purpose of a test case is that it is one in all in, one out all out. That is more than just an implication - it is an assurance by the parties to the court. On this basis alone I would have stayed the matter. 

81That it is in open court can be important. In Bloomfield v R [1996] EWCA Crim 1801; [1997] 1 Cr App R 135, a change of mind by the prosecution about not proceeding with a charge was held to be an abuse of the court's process. In that case counsel for the Crown's statement about abandoning the prosecution was made in open court and later again to the trial judge in his Chambers. The trial judge acted upon it by making an order adjourning the further proceedings. Staughton LJ said at 143:
The statement of the prosecution that they would offer no evidence at the next hearing was not merely a statement made to the defendant or to his legal representative. It was made coram judice, in the presence of a judge.

Collateral Purpose
82The defence contend at paragraphs 15 to 21 of their submissions that the prosecution has been instituted for a collateral purpose. They submit that a question arises as to whether the prosecutions are being pursued for a political aim, given the high profile issue of CSG in the community. The defence further submit that the prosecution may be as a result of embarrassment by ""Sydney"" over the visiting specialist unit police and their failure to comply with LEPRA. 

83It is correct that the courts will not usually look behind the reason for a prosecutorial discretion. However, this is an exception to that situation. The applicants have 'fair and square' laid out their concerns relating to these matters in their submissions. Two solicitors have prepared lengthy affidavits replete with attachments to support this application. The response from the prosecution is to simply point out that there is no evidence beyond mere conjecture. To an extent that is true - there is no smoking gun that proves political interference or specialist squad intervention. However, nor have the police chosen to dispel these suggestions with any evidence, or any alternative scenario that does not involve collateral purpose. The informant has not filed any evidence to explain why the new charges have been laid, and had they, any cross-examination may have shed light on this issue. There is nothing in submissions which dispel the applicants' contentions. In particular, there is nothing from the informant to explain why his superiors determined to withdraw the charges, and he then instructed another prosecutor to run a different matter. 

84In my view, the burden on the applicant relating to a collateral purpose may be shown by inference. In this case I find myself asking ""what could possibly be the reason for continuing on with such an 'innocuous' charge in these circumstances?"" Whilst suspicion is not enough, what else is the court to conclude when the prosecution offers no other alternative to the issues raised by the applicants? Why else would the police risk a costs order against them in the original matters which were withdrawn (which could run into the many tens of thousands of dollars), drive a prosecutor up from Sydney to run the matters, arrange police witnesses to travel from Sydney all for an 'innocuous' minor traffic matter. 

85The defence is correct that the CSG issue is political, to say the least. The arrests in this case are just one set of many, and the defendants who have come before me are generally over 50 years, well educated with a fair smattering of farmers and professionals. It is in that context that the realistic suspicion of political interference arises. 

86My mind has wavered on this issue. There is suspicion, and there is a lack of any other rational purpose. However, I have formed the conclusion that I am not satisfied to the requisite degree that the prosecution in the fresh matters has been launched for a collateral purpose. Accordingly, I do not take into account the matters raised by the applicants on this issue. 

The Vexatious Argument
87The applicants contend that the prosecution is vexatious for four different but related reasons.

88First, the applicants submit at paragraph 23 that the fresh charges are vexatious in that they are only a slight variant on the charges to be withdrawn. I do not agree. It is commonplace and not of itself vexatious for the prosecution to withdraw one charge and replace it with another. As the respondent police contend - that happens every day. 

89Second, the applicants further submit at paragraphs 28 to 30 that the current charges involve the re-litigation of a matter already resolved in a prior proceeding. I do not agree. The prior proceedings were not an attempt and thus the issues to be determined are different. Further, as the respondent prosecution submissions state at 31, in this case, the defendants are actually different people. 

90The applicants thirdly submit at 24 to 27 that the prosecution case is likely to fail the proximity test and is a weak case. That may be so, but a weak case is not enough. It must be foredoomed to fail. In my view it does not fall within that category but it appears to be weak and replete with hurdles. To explain the reason behind this finding it is necessary to analyse the nature of this offence with respect to the Commonwealth Code. This is a somewhat tortuous process. 

91At common law a summary offence cannot be attempted: R v Bristol Magistrates Court [1998] 3 All ER 798. This is clearly a summary offence: Criminal Procedure Act 1986 s 6(c). It would be expected to follow that there is no ""attempt"" alternative to a charge where the offence alleged is proscribed by the Road Rules. Indeed, that expectation is strengthened by the ridiculous concept of a charge that seeks to prove ""attempt cross dividing lines"", or ""attempt not wear seatbelt"". Further, at least in my mind, there are significant logical problems with a charge of attempt an offence identified by s 236 which is a strict liability offence. However, the road rules specifically import the Commonwealth Code:

10-1 NSW rule: determination of criminal responsibility
(1) Application of Commonwealth Criminal CodeSubject to this rule, Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code set out in the Schedule to the Criminal Code Act 1995 of the Commonwealth (the Commonwealth Criminal Code) applies to an offence against these Rules as if the Chapter were in force as a law of New South Wales.
(2) Offences are strict liability offencesAn offence against these Rules is a strict liability offence for the purposes of Chapter 2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code (as applied by subrule (1)), except where these Rules expressly provide otherwise.

92Section 11.1 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code reads:

11.1 Attempt
(1) A person who attempts to commit an offence is guilty of the offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed.
(2) For the person to be guilty, the person's conduct must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The question whether conduct is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence is one of fact.
(3) For the offence of attempting to commit an offence, intention and knowledge are fault elements in relation to each physical element of the offence attempted.
Note: Under section 3.2, only one of the fault elements of intention or knowledge would need to be established in respect of each physical element of the offence attempted.
(3A) Subsection (3) has effect subject to subsection (6A).
(4) A person may be found guilty even if:
(a) committing the offence attempted is impossible; or
(b) the person actually committed the offence attempted.
(5) A person who is found guilty of attempting to commit an offence cannot be subsequently charged with the completed offence.
(6) Any defences, procedures, limitations or qualifying provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of attempting to commit that offence.
(6A) Any special liability provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of attempting to commit that offence.

93It would seem that even though the offence is a strict liability offence, the effect of the Code is that where it is charged as an attempt, the prosecution must prove intention. This conclusion is based on s 11.1(3) above and the application of s 5.2 of the Code. It also seems to be the conclusion of the High Court in R v LK; R v RK [2010] HCA 17. I note that the Commonwealth Guide to the Criminal Code produced by the Commonwealth Attorney Generals Department explains this as follows: 
In offences which impose absolute or strict liability, the prosecution is not required to prove fault with respect to some or all physical elements of the offence: Ch 2: Division 6 - Cases where fault elements are not required. The rule is different, when an attempt to commit one of these offences is charged: the prosecution must prove intention or knowledge with respect to each element of the principal offence.3

94Accordingly, the prosecution would have to prove that the defendants were intending to block the road when the vehicles came. It may be that recklessness will suffice: O'Meara v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 90 at [61]. 

95The prosecution would thus have to prove that the accused did an intentional act towards the commission of the offence. Blocking the road would seem to be an intentional act toward the commission of the offence. However, it seems to me that the prosecution would have real difficulties in proving that each applicant's intention at that time was to obstruct the path of the drivers. The mens rea test for attempt offences is an intention to commit the completed offence: Giorgianni v R (1985) 156 CLR 473 per Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ at 506. The Crown must prove an intention to bring about each element of the crime alleged. Britten v Alpogut (1986) 23 A Crim R 254 at 258 per Murphy J (Fullagar and Gobbo JJ concurring). This decision was followed in R v Mai & Tran (1992) 26 NSWLR 371. The prosecution would have to exclude the rational alternative - it may have been to protest and then to move when the vehicles arrived as other protesters did. An alternative would be to prove that the defendants knew that the conduct would cause such an obstruction in the ordinary course of events. Again, that would depend on the defendant's aim and role in the protest. It would then need to prove that the offence was more than preparatory. I agree with the defence submissions at 25 that:
It would be difficult to suggest that anyone standing on a road in the absence of a vehicle to obstruct could be doing more than preparing to obstruct it, if that.

96That would be a question of fact to be determined at the hearing, so the conclusion I reach is that Road Rule 236 can be charged as an attempt, and is thus magically transformed into an offence where intention must be proven. Should this matter ever get to hearing, no doubt these issues will be researched more thoroughly by the parties and the judicial officer who draws that short straw. For my part, I conclude that there are reasonable prospects that the offence is one known to law. 

97I am unable to conclude with any confidence that the offence is one foredoomed to fail. The Code applies a simple test for 11.1(2). The question is simply: Was the conduct of the defendant ""more than merely preparatory""? The question requires a conclusion of fact to be drawn in the light of all the circumstances of the case.

98However, in my view, my conclusion that the case is weak but not foredoomed does not lead to the conclusion that a stay cannot be made. This is not some mathematical 'tick-a-box' process - it is the entirety of the circumstances that the court must consider, and in my view the fact that the case is weak is a factor that mitigates in favour of a stay. 

99The applicants fourthly submit that the fresh charge is multiple and successive prosecution. Richardson J in Moevao v Department of Labour [1980] 1 NZLR 464 (which was expressly approved by Mason CJ in Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 30) said at 482:
The justification for staying a prosecution is that the Court is obliged to take that extreme step in order to protect its own processes from abuse. It does so in order to prevent the criminal processes from being used for purposes alien to the administration of criminal justice under the law. It may intervene in this way if it concludes from the conduct of the prosecutor in relation to the prosecution that the Court processes are being employed for ulterior purposes or in such a way (for example, through multiple or successive proceedings) as to cause improper vexation and oppression. The yardstick is not simply fairness to the particular accused. It is not whether the initiation and continuation of the particular process seems in the circumstances to be unfair to him. That may be an important consideration. But the focus is on the misuse of the court process by those responsible for law enforcement. It is whether the continuation of the prosecution is inconsistent with the recognised purposes of the administration of criminal justice and so constitutes an abuse of the process of the Court. (my emphasis)

100In this case it is my view that the proceedings are indeed vexatious successive prosecutions. By choosing not to file any evidence, it is difficult to see which ""recognised purpose of the administration of criminal justice"" is being applied by the prosecution in this case. 

101The prosecution contend at paragraph 10 of their submissions that the attempt being formulated ""late in the peace [sic]"" is regrettable. In my view, it is more than that. The prosecution delayed until the last possible day to institute the proceedings. The explanation given is that the attempt charges were preferred in order to remedy a perceived legal difficulty in proving the substantive offence. In my view that submission does nothing to explain why the charging process took so long, was so late, was following an unequivocal withdrawal of the proceedings and was in breach of a court sanctioned and approved agreement. To suggest that any injustice can be ameliorated by adjournment ignores the oppressive nature of successive and repetitive charging such as this. 

The Prosecutorial Discretion
102The respondent police submit that courts have been very reluctant to intervene with prosecutorial discretion, and rely in particular on R v Brown (1989) 17 NSWLR 472 and Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 513 to 514. 

103The prosecution is correct. However, a stay application is the one area where the court does legitimately scrutinise the prosecutorial decision making process. In Maxwell the court found at 512: 
It would thus appear that in England the position is now as it always has been in this country. Our courts do not purport to exercise control over the institution or continuation of criminal proceedings, save where it is necessary to do so to prevent an abuse of process or to ensure a fair trial. 

104In Brown, there was a plea of guilty to an offence. The sentencing judge was not happy with this, believing that the more serious charge should have stood. He stayed the proceedings on his own motion, in what appears to have been a fit of pique. The appeal court intervened, and lifted the stay. It is in this context that the High Court considered Brown in Maxwell. In the key passage, at 513 to 514, the court is careful to stress that the court does have the power, in rare cases, to stay a prosecution to protect an abuse of its process. Indeed, the court found: 
The court's power to prevent an abuse of its process is a different matter and the question of its exercise can only arise in this context if the prosecuting authority were seen to be acting in an irresponsible manner.

105Chung v The Queen (2007) 175 A Crim R 579 is referred to by the prosecution in this context. This was a case where an abuse of process was alleged, as the charge was one of conspiracy rather than the substantive charge. The court rejected the application for a stay, and reviewed the authorities on the role of the court and the prosecution. However, review of the authorities again relates to the situation where the court is concerned with a more serious or less serious charge than the court considers correct. Further, the authorities referred to, and indeed specifically contained within the quotes referred to, acknowledge that an abuse of process is an exception to the hands-off approach. Chung is specifically not an authority for the proposition that the court no longer retains a power to stay proceedings for abuse of process where the facts of a particular case demand it. 

Findings and Orders
106The defence submits at paragraph 36 that it is open to the court to find aspects of the various forms of abuse of process discussed above, and I agree with this submission. 

107Given the minor nature of the offence, the clear, unequivocal and inexcusable breaking of an agreement by the prosecution, the vexations nature of further proceedings, the lack of any explanation for the delay in fresh charges, the inherent weakness of the case and the repetitive and successive nature of the ongoing proceedings, the failure by the prosecution to comply with the practice directions of the court thus leading to wasted days at Maclean, taking all of these together in my view the continuation of these proceedings is inconsistent with the recognised purposes of the administration of criminal justice and so constitutes an abuse of the process of the court.

108And the fault for each of the matters referred to in the paragraph immediately above lies on the respondent police and whoever is instructing the prosecutor in relation to the fresh charges. It was perfectly clear that you couldn't interfere with the passage of a vehicle when there is no vehicle. The requirements of LEPRA are not new or difficult - just say your name and station and warn people that if they do not move they may be arrested. An agreement to run a test case and a commitment to withdraw charges is exactly that, and the courts will not stand idly by whilst promises are broken without any explanation whatsoever beyond ""instructions"". The Local Court is not some platform for the prosecution, where charges can be withdrawn one day and reinstated in some different form the next without any notice to the court of the vacation of the original hearings. And if police from Sydney are not happy with the actions of police on the North Coast, then that can be sorted out in a way that does not disadvantage the recipients of a promise, the court and ultimately the people of New South Wales. 

109It may well be that any one or even more of these matters would not have reached the threshold required. It is the combination of each of them (excluding the collateral purpose issues) that would, in my view, lead right thinking people to the conclusion that this is not just unfair: to allow it to continue would bring the criminal law and the court itself into disrepute. 

110Accordingly, I order that the prosecutions in respect of each of these defendants pursuant to r 236 of the Road Rules are permanently stayed. 

111I intend to adjourn the other matters where this fresh charge has been laid until I return from leave on 9 December 3013, so that the prosecution and the defence can consider their positions on the resolution of those matters in the light of this judgment.

2705965,Regina v JP (No 1) [2013] NSWSC 1678,"Judgment

1At about 12.30pm on 30 October 2013, the jury sent a note which was marked as MFI-68. The note, written by the foreperson of the jury, referred to the fact that one juror had undertaken legal research by way of an Internet search.

2The procedure then adopted pursuant to directions I gave on the above date was to have the Sheriff's officer request the foreperson to leave the jury room and accompany him to the Court. Following his examination, the Sheriff's officer was requested to follow the same procedure in order to have the juror in question brought into the courtroom.

3At about 2.00pm on that date, I proceeded to conduct an examination of the foreperson pursuant to s 55DA of the Jury Act 1977 (""the Act"").

4The information provided by the foreperson in answer to questions which I directed to him has been extracted into the reasons for the order made under s 53C of the Act in R v JP (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1679 at [12].

5I also proceeded with an examination of the juror in question. The questions and answers in relation to that examination have also been set out in R v JP (No 2) at [13].

The Statutory Provisions

6Part 7A of the Jury Act is entitled ""Discharge of Jurors"". The provisions of ss 53A and 53B are concerned with the discharge of individual jurors.

7Section 53A is concerned with the mandatory discharge of an individual juror. Pursuant to the provisions of that section, a court must discharge a juror if in the course of any trial:

""(a) The juror has engaged in misconduct in relation to the trial ...""

8The term ""misconduct"" is defined in s 53A(2) to included:

""Conduct that constitutes an offence against this Act.""

9A juror who conducted legal research on the internet would be in breach of the trial directions which I gave at the commencement of the trial. It would also constitute a breach of the provisions of s 68C(1) and also s 68C(4) of the Act. In this respect, I respectfully agree and adopt what has been said in this regard in R v Sio (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1414 at [7] per Adamson J.

10Both counsel for the Crown, and the accused, submitted that the juror referred to in MFI-68 had to be discharged. That accorded with the conclusion which I had reached following the examination of the juror in question conducted pursuant to s 55DA and expressed.

11On 30 October 2013 I made an order that the relevant juror be discharged. I indicated that I would publish my reasons on a later date. 

12Following the completion of the examination, the juror in question was immediately separated from the jurors who were then in the jury room. Arrangements were made for the Sheriff's officer to retrieve her personal belongings from the jury room on her behalf.

13The jury, constituted by the eleven remaining jurors, was brought back into Court and informed that the relevant juror had been discharged, and in that respect the jury were given a direction in line with the Criminal Bench Book direction at [1-515]. 

Finding and Order

14The discharged juror engaged in misconduct in breach of s 68C of the Act. Upon that finding, on 30 October 2013 I made the following order: 

Order that the juror be discharged from the jury pursuant to s 53A of the Jury Act 1977.

		21 March 2014",2013-10-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705967,R v Paton (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1616,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1The issue has arisen whether manslaughter should be left to the jury in this murder trial.  The Crown Prosecutor submits that it should not be.  Senior counsel for the accused, on reflection, submits that it should.  It is agreed between the parties, and I also agree, that this issue should be determined by me before the Crown Prosecutor commences his final address.
2The test, in a nutshell, is whether manslaughter is viable on the evidence (see R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; (2005) 157 A Crim R 238; (2005) 64 NSWLR 527).  The general approach of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court of Australia is that trial judges should generally err on the side of caution and leave manslaughter if there is any doubt about its viability (see, for example, Carney v R; Cambey v R [2011] NSWCCA 223).
3The Crown case is that Peter Kearnes shot the deceased in Wagga Wagga with an intention to kill and that the accused was complicit in that crime, either as a principal in the first degree by way of joint criminal enterprise (see Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316 and Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6), or as a principal in the second degree, that is, as an accessory before or at the fact (see generally R v Stokes; R v Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25).
4In an ERISP, the accused denied that he was in Wagga Wagga at all.  In alleged admissions to his aunt, after the shooting, the accused said, amongst other things, words to the effect that he and Peter Kearnes went to the scene to ""sort the deceased out"", that he was at the scene but did not ""do it"", and that he, the accused, was actually across the road at the time of the fatal shooting.
5The accused did not give evidence in this trial, although he did purport to plead guilty to accessory after the fact of murder at the start of the trial when he was arraigned.  At that stage he did not plead guilty to manslaughter.  
6In other words, there is nothing from the evidence of what the accused said in his interview with police or by his plea to support the proposition that he was complicit in some lesser crime than murder that could found liability for manslaughter.
7Ms Tamsin Cameron is a witness who was, it does not seem to be disputed, in the company of Peter Kearnes and the accused on the evening before the murder.  In cross-examination the following exchange took place between her and senior counsel for the accused:
""Q.  'And once they sort of mentioned that they were going over to Wagga'.  That's what it says, is that right?A.  That's correct.
Q.  'I didn't really know who they were going to do or what was going on, and I didn't really believe that they'd do it, I just thought they were going to go over and frighten someone'.  That's what you told the police, is that right?A.  That's correct, that's what it says.
Q.  When you read that, does that - do you have a recollection of saying that or does it surprise you that you've said that?A.  No because they did - they did mention Wagga at one stage, but I didn't know if they were actually going there.""
Submissions
8Senior counsel for the accused submitted that, in short, the jury could accept the evidence of the aunt and conclude that the accused was indeed part of a joint criminal enterprise to ""sort out"" the deceased; that is, to confront him or assault him, perhaps severely.  And he submitted that the jury could interpret the evidence of what Ms Cameron had said to the police as supporting the proposition that the accused and Peter Kearnes had agreed to frighten the deceased, perhaps with the firearm she gave evidence that she had seen on that evening.
9In short, he submitted that assaulting the deceased or frightening him with a firearm could constitute an unlawful and dangerous act and that act could have caused the death of the deceased, in the sense of having substantially contributed to his death (see generally Royall v The Queen [1991] HCA 27; (1991) 172 CLR 378 and R v Moffatt [2000] NSWCCA 174).  He submitted that the jury could find that the accused was complicit in such an unlawful and dangerous act causing death and that, therefore, manslaughter should be left to the jury because it is viable on the evidence.
10The Crown Prosecutor submitted that Ms Cameron was speaking of what she believed or assumed, not recounting directly or indirectly what the two men had said.  Accordingly, it is no evidence of any agreement between the accused and Peter Kearnes, he submitted, to frighten the deceased with a firearm or anything else.
11As for the alleged admission to the aunt of the accused, the Crown Prosecutor emphasised that the act causing death was, in fact, the firing of four bullets into the head and neck of the deceased at close range.  A ""sorting out"", if it be some kind of confrontation or physical assault had, he submitted, nothing to do with the death of the deceased.  In other words, he submitted that the act causing death was not a physical assault or anything like it.  Accordingly, he submitted that even if the accused said those words to his aunt, and even if they encompassed something that could perhaps have been unlawful and dangerous, that act had nothing to do with causing the death of the deceased.  
12The Crown Prosecutor also emphasised that there were no injuries to the body of the deceased other than the four bullet wounds to which I have referred.  
13Finally, he emphasised that there was no evidence from any source of a confrontation or assault gone wrong or taken too far by Peter Kearnes.
Determination  
14I respectfully agree with the characterisation by the Crown Prosecutor of the evidence of Ms Cameron.  To my mind, she was speaking to the police of her belief, and not of anything she had heard Peter Kearnes or the accused say or agree in.  Accordingly, her evidence is not evidence of complicity on the part of the accused in frightening the deceased.  On that basis, I put her evidence to one side with regard to this application.
15As for what was allegedly said to the aunt of the accused, I interpret ""sorting out"" someone as, indeed, meaning some form of confrontation or assault.  It was, after all, allegedly said to the aunt in the context of the accused telling her that Peter Kearnes was upset about the deceased having mistreated one of the children of Mr Kearnes.  It is also noteworthy that that alleged statement was part of a conversation in which it is alleged that the accused was generally exculpatory with regard to any involvement on his part in the murder.
16Let it be assumed that the jury, contrary not only to my understanding at this stage of the case for the accused but also contrary to the Crown case, accepted that the accused entered into an agreement with Peter Kearnes merely to ""sort out"" the deceased in the sense of a confrontation or assault.  Even then, it could not be said that either of such events could be remotely connected to the death of the deceased.  By that I mean, it was not a confrontation that caused the death of the deceased and it was not a physical beating; rather, it was being shot repeatedly.
17I also consider it significant that there is no evidence from any source of a confrontation or a beating leading to or somehow developing into the discharge of the firearm.  To the extent that there was no sign of forced entry to the flat of the deceased, that the deceased had no other injuries, and that no witness has given evidence of hearing raised voices before the shooting, if anything the evidence is to the contrary.  
18It follows that I do not consider that it is viable to say, even interpreting the evidence of the aunt in the way for which senior counsel for the accused contends, that the accused was complicit in an unlawful and dangerous act that caused the death of the deceased, even if one interprets the concept of criminal causation very broadly.
19Accordingly, although it may be possible to construct a hypothesis supportive of the application, I respectfully consider that such a hypothesis is highly speculative, contrary to the evidence, contrary to my understanding of the cases of the two parties, and would only serve to confuse the jury thoroughly.  For those reasons, I do not regard manslaughter as viable in this trial, and I do not propose to leave it to the jury.

2705968,R v Paton [2013] NSWSC 1615,"Judgment
1Senior counsel for the accused has made an unusual application.  It is, in short, that I order the Crown Prosecutor to add a count to the indictment.  The background of the application is as follows.
2On 21 October 2013, the accused was arraigned before a jury panel and me on a single count of murder.  At the time he pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to accessory after the fact of murder.  I have been informed that the Crown Prosecutor was aware that that was to take place.  That plea was not accepted by the Crown Prosecutor, and the trial has proceeded since then on the count of murder.  
3The Crown case in a nutshell is that the accused was complicit in the murder by shooting of the deceased by an associate of the accused.  That complicity is founded both upon joint criminal enterprise and separately upon what I call accessorial liability; that is, the form of complicity discussed in the well-known case of R v Stokes; R v Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25.  In terms of evidence, the Crown case is founded on a number of alleged acts and statements of the accused, many of which are said to have occurred or been made after the shooting.  
4At first senior counsel for the accused submitted that accessory after the fact of murder is an available alternative to a count of murder.  However, after having reflected on, amongst other things, R v Cameron (1983) 2 NSWLR 66; 8 A Crim R 466, R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510; 66 A Crim R 419, and R v Aldridge (1993) 67 A Crim R 371, he came to the position that the only alternatives to a count in an indictment are:
(1)those that are specifically available by statute; and
(2)those lesser offences that are made up of elements that are entirely included in the elements of the greater offence contained in the indictment.  
5I shall refer to the latter alternatives as ""included alternatives.""  Some examples are assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault, and robbery and larceny.  
6He also accepted that, for reasons that do not need to be delved into deeply now, manslaughter is always an available alternative to murder, even though the elements of manslaughter (for example, a manslaughter by way of unlawful and dangerous act) are not always necessarily included in a count of murder.  
7In short, senior counsel for the accused accepted that accessory after the fact of murder does not fit within any of those categories of alternatives to a count of murder.  I respectfully agree with the position of senior counsel.  
8Accordingly, it is clear that he is not seeking to have me leave an alternative count to the jury's consideration and verdict.  Rather, he is seeking to have me order the Crown to add a discrete and separate count to the indictment.  
9I should note that, quite apart from this application, senior counsel has respectfully invited the Crown Prosecutor to adopt that course, and the Crown Prosecutor has respectfully declined.  
Submissions
10The application of senior counsel has a number of bases.
11First, he submitted that ss 20 and 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, properly construed, reserve to me the power to make the order sought.  
12Secondly, he submitted that a number of cases show that trial Judges have a responsibility to leave counts for the consideration of juries, even despite the opposition of one or both parties.  
13Thirdly, he invited my attention to the fact that, in R v Aldridge, Sheller JA said at 377 to 378:
""Where before trial or at any stage of the trial it appears to the court that the indictment is defective, the court shall make such order for the amendment of the indictment as the court thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case, unless, having regard to the merits of the case, the required amendments cannot be made without injustice: s 365(1) of the Crimes Act. This subsection in its present form was substituted in 1929 and is the same as s 5(1) of the Indictments Act 1915  (Imp). The English courts have construed s 5(1) liberally and held that an indictment may be defective within the meaning of the subsection if it fails to allege an offence disclosed by the depositions or, alternatively, if it alleges an offence not disclosed by the depositions. Further there is no rule of law which precludes the amendment of an indictment after arraignment, either by addition of a new count or otherwise."" (emphasis added)
14Fourthly, senior counsel noted that, in his opening, the learned Crown Prosecutor said words to the effect that the evidence would show that the accused was an accessory before, during, and after the fact of murder.  Senior counsel for the accused emphasised that much of the evidence relates to events after the shooting, and he submitted that, if the count of accessory after the fact of murder is not on the indictment, the jury may, contrary to my directions, be tempted to return a verdict of guilty of murder on the basis of that evidence, if there is not a count of accessory after the fact of murder before them.  
15To the contrary, the learned Crown Prosecutor simply submitted respectfully that I have no power to order him to add or indeed subtract counts from indictments.  He also submitted that merely because a person may have undertaken acts that could show that he or she was an accessory after the fact of murder does not preclude him or her from being implicated in the murder itself.
Determination
16I respectfully consider that I have no power to order the Crown Prosecutor to add a count to the indictment.  In my twenty-seven years of involvement in the criminal justice system, I have never heard of such an order being made.  In any event, I consider that it would be inconsistent with the separation of powers under the Westminster system.
17Separately, I do not consider that ss 20 and 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act apply here.  They are as follows:
""20   Amendment of indictment
(1)  An indictment may not be amended after it is presented, except by the prosecutor:
(a)  with the leave of the court, or
(b)  with the consent of the accused.
(2)  This section does not affect the powers of the court under section 21.
(3)  For the purposes of this section, an amendment of an indictment includes the substitution of an indictment.
21   Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial
(1)  If of the opinion that an indictment is defective but, having regard to the merits of the case, can be amended without injustice, the court may make such order for the amendment of the indictment as it thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case.
(2)  If of the opinion:
(a)  that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or
(b)  that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,
the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.
(3)  If of the opinion that the postponement of an accused person's trial is expedient as a consequence of it having amended an indictment or ordered a separate trial of a count, the court may make such order as appears necessary.
(4)  An order under this section may be made either before trial or at any stage during the trial.
(5)  The following provisions apply if an order is made under this section for a separate trial or for the postponement of a trial:
(a)  if the order is made during the trial, the court may order that the jury be discharged from giving a verdict:
(i)  on the count or counts in respect of which the trial is postponed, or
(ii)  on the indictment,
as the case may be,
(b)  the procedure on the separate trial of a count, and the procedure on the postponed trial, are to be the same in all respects (if the jury has been discharged) as if the trial had not commenced,
(c)  subject to the Bail Act 1978, the court may commit the accused person to a correctional centre.
(6)  Any power of the court under this section is in addition to and not in derogation of any other power of the court for the same or similar purposes.""
18To my mind, those sections are to do with defective indictments.  There is nothing defective about this indictment, which is perfectly regular and reflective of the Crown allegation geographically and temporally.  
19Separately, I consider that those sections are to do with trial Judges permitting amendment on the application of a Crown Prosecutor, not ordering that that occur.  
20Thirdly, it is accepted that all of the cases to which I was invited are to do with the leaving of available alternatives, whether they be statutory alternatives, included alternatives, or manslaughter with regard to an indictment containing a count of murder.  That is not the case here.
21Finally, in R v Aldridge what was under discussion was the leaving at trial of an alternative offence pursuant to then s 35 of the Crimes Act in an indictment containing a count pursuant to then s 33 of the same Act.  And yet the elements of the s 35 offence were not included in the particular variant of s 33 that appeared in the indictment.  As one would expect, the conviction on the lesser alternative count was quashed.  
22I consider that the remarks of Sheller JA must be read in that context.  I certainly do not read them as empowering a trial Judge to order a Crown Prosecutor to place an entirely separate count on an indictment if the Crown Prosecutor does not wish to do so.  And it is noteworthy that, in the immediately subsequent paragraph, his Honour spoke of an application by the Crown to amend the indictment, not of the trial Judge ordering such an amendment.  
23It follows that I respectfully decline to order the Crown Prosecutor to add a count to the indictment.  The trial will proceed with the indictment containing a single count of murder.  
24Finally, I respectfully consider that it may well have been inapposite for the accused to plead guilty to accessory after the fact of murder, in light of the foregoing analysis, which is to the effect that it was not available on the indictment averring murder.  But that, to my mind, is of no great moment, because it is very likely that, in order for the jury to understand the issues in the trial, I will need to give them some explanation of the attributes of that offence in my summing-up in any event.

		05 November 2013",2013-10-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705974,R v Paton (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1617,"Judgment
1Defence counsel has submitted that I should direct the jury that there are a number of indispensable intermediate facts in this circumstantial Crown case.  He has submitted that I should direct the jury that they are ""links in the chain"", about which the jury would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt before they could reason to the position that the Crown has proven the guilt of the accused of murder beyond reasonable doubt.
2All of the facts under discussion are derived solely from the evidence of Ms Tamsin Cameron.  The first is that on 20 July 2011 a firearm was in the living room of the house of Mr Peter Kearnes, and in the general presence of the accused.  The second is that ammunition was in the same location, and that the accused was aware of it.  The third is that Mr Kearnes made an emotional threat to kill ""the fucking paedophile"" in the presence of the accused on the same occasion.  
3The Crown Prosecutor resists the application on the basis that those facts are not indispensable to the success of the prosecution case.  He submits that there is ample other evidence that the accused either took part in a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Kearnes to murder the deceased, or intentionally assisted or encouraged Mr Kearnes, with knowledge of the offence of murder that Mr Kearnes was to commit or was committing.  
4The Crown Prosecutor has accepted however that, in light of the importance of the evidence of Ms Cameron to the Crown case, a ""Murray direction"" should be given by me.  I respectfully accept that I should give some form of such a warning: see R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12; 30 A Crim R 315.
5The question of how a trial judge should determine whether a fact in a circumstantial case is indispensable in the sense discussed in Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; (1990) 170 CLR 573 and many subsequent cases has recently been answered by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal.  In Davidson v R [2009] NSWCCA 150; (2009) 75 NSWLR 150; (2009) 195 A Crim R 406, Simpson J, with the agreement of Spigelman CJ and James J, said the following at [74] of her Honour's judgment:
""Whether a fact on which the Crown relies as part of a circumstantial case is or is not 'indispensable' may be tested by asking whether, in the absence of evidence of that fact, there would nonetheless be a case to go to the jury. If the answer is in the affirmative, even if the Crown case is weakened, evenconsiderably, the fact is not 'indispensable'. Where the answer is in the negative, the fact is 'indispensable' and the jury should be directed accordingly.""
6It follows that, in order to determine the application, I need to consider and briefly outline the Crown case as a whole.  I shall do so in rough chronological order.  I shall leave aside of course the facts under consideration.  Due to the exigencies of the situation I will not seek to identify the source of each piece of evidence.  For abundant caution, I will leave out of my conspectus some other evidence from Ms Cameron that is hotly disputed.  
7The accused and Peter Kearnes each lived in Tumut as at 20 and 21 July 2011.  They had met some weeks before at a hotel and become acquaintances.  The accused was in the habit of doing odd jobs for Mr Kearnes for money.  
8In the afternoon of 20 July 2011 the accused drove back from Canberra to Tumut and was driving fast.  
9On the evening of 20 July 2011 the two men were at the home of Mr Kearnes in Dalhunty Street, Tumut.  They left there together and travelled together a short distance to the home of Mr Peter Minogue, and brought him back to the home of Mr Kearnes.  They left Ms Cameron and Mr Minogue there.  In the home was a police scanner capable of monitoring events in Wagga.  
10The two men travelled together in a motor vehicle belonging to Ms Cameron to Wagga.  That was despite the fact that a motor vehicle belonging to Mr Kearnes was available at his home.  They did not leave the Tumut area before 2.29am.  The journey takes at least one hour.  
11At about 4.48am in the apartment of the deceased in Wagga, Mr Kearnes used a .22 calibre firearm to shoot the deceased repeatedly in the head and neck.  There had not been forced entry, and there were no other injuries to the deceased.  
12On two occasions, at 5.28 and 5.36am, the accused entered a BP service station very close to the scene of the crime.  On each occasion the accused approached a bin in the forecourt of the service station.  
13Some time roughly around 5.40am or so, Ms Veronica Douglas saw the accused sitting on a fence, very close to the scene of the shooting.  The accused said that he was there because of an argument with his girlfriend, who was drunk in a nearby motel.  He climbed the internal stairs of the apartment block, past the flat of the deceased, and told Ms Douglas the same thing to her face at the front door of her unit, directly above the flat of the deceased.
14At 6am Ms Fay Gordon saw two men in or near a  Ford Territory, very near the scene of the crime.  One of the men resembled, in her opinion, the accused to some degree.  
15At 6.18am Mr Smith saw from his vehicle a person very broadly consistent with the accused standing at the intersection that is very close to the scene of the crime.  
16At 6.40am the Ford Territory to which I referred a moment ago departed from its parking spot.  
17Later that morning at about 7 or 7.30am the accused and Mr Kearnes were together in a rural area called Tumblong between Wagga and Tumut.  After that the accused and Mr Kearnes returned to the home of Mr Kearnes.  
18At 5.10pm on 21 July 2011 Mr Kearnes and the accused were in the motor vehicle of Mr Kearnes travelling north at Yass, quite some distance from Tumut.  Nobody else was in the vehicle.  The accused was the driver.  He was speeding and not displaying his L plates.  The accused was seemingly heading to Sydney, a place that he had never been to before in his life.  
19On 2 September 2011, the accused was spoken to by police at the home of Mr Kearnes.  Later on the same day he engaged in a recorded interview.  In the original discussion and in the recorded interview, it is not disputed that the accused told five lies material to the events of 21 July 2011.  
20Some time in October 2011 the accused had a conversation with his aunt.  Amongst other things he said with regard to the shooting that he and Mr Kearnes went there to ""sort the deceased out"", that they both went up to the flat, and that he was not at the scene but close by when the shooting occurred.  
21On the Crown case he also told his aunt that Ms Cameron drove the motor vehicle on the evening.  It is accepted by admission that any such assertion was not correct.
22On 10 November 2011 the accused was arrested.  
23On 21 October 2013 the accused purported to plead guilty, whilst represented by senior counsel, to a count of accessory after the fact of murder.  
24Considering that brief and incomplete conspectus as a whole, and analysing it as a circumstantial case with regard to whether the accused was complicit in the shooting, I consider that there indeed would be a case to go to the jury in the absence of the asserted indispensable intermediate facts.  
25Of course all facts in a circumstantial case need to be considered in the context of each other, and their cumulative effect considered.  But to focus on but one fact and one inference that could be derived from it, I consider that it would be open to infer that the accused lied about Ms Cameron being the driver because he possessed a consciousness of guilt about his own role in having driven Mr Kearnes to Wagga, just as he was driving Mr Kearnes the following afternoon in Yass; he, the accused, himself complicit in the murder by way of joint criminal enterprise, or by way of intentional and knowing assistance to Mr Kearnes by that act of driving to the scene of the crime.
26It follows that I do not consider that the matters of the firearm, the ammunition, and the threat to kill are indispensable intermediate facts.  Accordingly, I do not propose to direct the jury that those matters must be established beyond reasonable doubt before the jury could reason towards satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt of the elements of the offence of murder by way of complicity.

		05 November 2013",2013-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705976,Regina v JP (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1679,"Judgment

1On 30 October 2013 I made an order pursuant to s 53A(1)(c) of the Jury Act 1977 (""the Act"") discharging a juror on the basis of misconduct within the meaning of s 53A(2) of the Act.

2Application was made by Mr Young SC, for the accused, for an order discharging the jury pursuant to s 53C(1)(a) of the Act.

3The trial commenced on 30 September 2013.

4At 10.56am on Monday, 28 October 2013, the jury retired to consider its verdict.

5At approximately 12.30pm Wednesday, 30 October 2013, the jury sent a note (MFI-68) which was in the following terms:

""It has been brought to our attention that one juror had been making their own enquiries on the Internet as to legal definitions of murder & manslaughter & discussing their findings with certain jurors. I felt that this needed to be brought to your attention.""

6Counsel for the Crown and the accused were soon after informed by me that the Jury Note, MFI-68 had been received and it was then made available to counsel.

7I determined that I would proceed with an examination of both the foreperson and the juror referred to in the Jury Note pursuant to s 55DA of the Act.

8The court reconvened shortly after 2.00pm whereupon the foreperson was brought into court, affirmed and examined in relation to MFI-68

9The foreperson confirmed that he was the author of the Jury Note. He also confirmed that he was present when the events to which the Jury Note referred took place. He said that there were two separate episodes relevant to those events.

10The first episode occurred some minutes before 10.00am Wednesday, 30 October 2013. There were then eleven jurors in attendance in the jury room. The juror referred to in the Jury Note was seen reading her iPhone. When questioned by a juror sitting next to that juror as to what she was doing she replied to the effect that the previous evening she had downloaded information from the Internet being material that dealt with the meaning in law of ""murder"" and ""manslaughter"". The foreperson's evidence was that the juror in question said: ""I've been looking at this overnight, and I'm having trouble determining the difference between murder and manslaughter, that is what it says"" and then looking at her phone. T 132-133. The foreperson intervened and told the juror she should not have brought such material into the jury room. Her mobile phone was then switched off and taken away.

11The second episode occurred at approximately midday when the juror in question said words to the effect that based on her abovementioned research, that the difference between murder and manslaughter involved malice. The juror did not have her iPhone at that time: T 133. The foreperson in the examination said up to four jurors commenced to make a verbal response but at the time were talking over each other. The foreperson said when he realised the context of what the juror was referring to he then told them to stop talking about it ""... based on your legal direction we should be making no outside inquiries"" (a reference to the relevant trial direction): T 134. The foreperson said he could not hear what was said by the four jurors because of the fact that they were talking over one another.

The Evidence

12The evidence given by the foreperson was as follows:

""Q. You are the foreperson of the jury? 
A. Yes. 

Q. I am going to ask you some questions to clarify matters. I want to make it very clear that I do not wish you to disclose in answering any of my questions anything to do with the jury deliberations; you understand? 
A. Yes. 

Q. I don't wish you to disclose in any way what the subject matter of the discussions have been in the course of the deliberations of the jury 
A. Yes. 

Q. Just focus if you would on the specific matters to which my questions will be directed, thank you. Would you have a look at MFI 68 (handed to witness). Firstly, is MFI 68 the jury note which has been written in your hand? 
A. Yes. 

Q. You are the author of the note on behalf of the jury? 
A. Yes. 

Q. You have referred in the jury note to one juror on the second line? 
A. Yes. 

Q. It's to that person I direct this question. Did the one juror to which references made disclose to you or in your presence the question of having made inquiries as referred to in this note? 
A. In my presence, yes. 

Q. And are you able to a say approximately when that occurred? 
A. I believe that it happened overnight that the first inquiries was made, and then on their actual phone they brought it in with the page open. 

Q. Just a moment. So this occurred today? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And at approximately what point in the morning did this occur? 
A. At the start of the morning when we were still waiting for one of our jurors to arrive she they had it open on their phone, and they kept on referring like after we took the phones away they were referring back to it and discussing what they had read on the Internet page. 

Q. Was this outside the jury room or inside the jury room? 
A. Inside the jury room. 

Q. At that time there were do I understand you to say 11 jurors present, including yourself or? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Or were all jurors present? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Sorry, was it? 
A. Both. They began when they were still 11, and they continued to referenced it during the day when there was 12. 

Q. Could I just, so that I understand you clearly, as to the first occasion in which anything was said by the juror referred to in the second line of your note, were all jurors present at that time or not? 
A. No.

Q. And how many were present? 
A. 11. 

Q. That included yourself? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And as best you are able to recall, what at that point did the juror to whom you refer on the second line of MFI 68 say, and/or do? 
A. They had the phone on the table, and mostly speaking to one juror in particular that sat next to them, and said that they had been looking at this page to try and better understand how the law differentiates between murder and manslaughter. 

Q. And did you recall anything else said at that point? 
A. Nothing at that time because I made the direction that we should put our phones away. 

Q. The phone to which you refer, at that time was it switched on or activated? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And was it held by that juror? 
A. They had it in their hand. They placed it on the table. 

Q. What, in front of that person placed it in front of themselves? 
A. Well in between themselves and the juror sitting next to them. 

Q. And from what you could see, you say the phone was turned on? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Could you see what was being shown on the phone or not? 
A. It appeared to be a web page with text on it. 

Q. And do you know whether anybody at the point of time you are now talking about was looking at the phone? 
A. I believe that the person whose phone it was, and the juror sitting next to them saw it, but I am not sure whether or not they read it other than that juror. 

Q. Could you tell me how long did this particular episode you've just described continue for? 
A. Possibly between one and two minutes. 

Q. And was the phone then switched off or taken away? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Was there anything said at this point in time that you've just been addressing as to the contents of any research that the juror had undertaken? 
A. They said they were looking at it, and they were looking at the difference between murder and manslaughter. 

Q. Just tell me if you can best recall what was said by that person who had the phone in your presence? 
A. Well I did say it before, but it was something to the effect of: ""I've been looking at this overnight, and I'm having trouble determining the difference between murder and manslaughter, this is what it says""; and then looking at the phone. 

Q. Did that juror then articulate what it said or 
A. Not at that time, no. 

Q. Was there anything else said about the question of research at the end of the episode you've just described? 
A. Later on, after the phone had been 

Q. We will come to that now. Before we get to the next, what I will call episode about this, do you recall whether there was any other discussion amongst any other members of the jury as to what you have just described in terms of the content of any research that had been undertaken, or was there no discussion? 
A. There was discussion later on, but it involved all 12 with that particular juror raising it, but apart from that nothing. 

Q. Perhaps we will come to that now then. Before I do, just to be clear, do the questions I have put and your answers to effectively exhaust what happened in relation to that first episode we have just discussed? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Thank you. We will move to the second. Approximately when did the second occasion arise when anything was said about research having been undertaken? 
A. I can't be 100 percent accurate, but between one and two hours later, so approximately 12 o'clock. 

Q. Were all jurors present at that time? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And firstly, taking it a step at a time, again in going to the juror referred to on the second line of your--
A. Yes. 

Q. --note, MFI 68, did you hear that person say anything about research, or having undertaken research? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And doing the best you can, using the words as best you can, recall what was said on that topic by that person? 
A. They said that 

Q. You say ""they"", are you talking about a person, are you? 
A. Yes this particular jury, that 

Q. That person said 
A. Yes 

Q. Said what?
A. That person said that based on the research that they had read, that the difference between murder and manslaughter involved malice; and I can't recall anything beyond that. 

Q. When you use the word ""they"", you are referring to the single person? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did that person have the phone? 
A. No. 

Q. Not at that time? 
A. No. 

Q. Do you recall that person saying anything more than what you've just said? 
A. No. 

Q. Was there any discussion in response to what that person said in what you've just referred to as the second episode on this question of research undertaken by the juror? 
A. Yes. 

Q. I want you then to focus on that. Trying to identify, without disclosing the identity of anyone, what was said by a person, or if there is more than one, persons in response to this topic, or on the topic of research that the juror said he or she had undertaken? 
A. The majority of the conversation was centred on that particular juror speaking, and when I realised that that was the context of what they were talking about I immediately said to, you know, stop talking about it, that based on your legal direction we should be making no outside inquiries. 

Q. Just going back over that. What I need to have from you, if you are able to, recall, what the juror referred to in MFI 68 actually said by way of words on the topic, if said anything at all, can you recall what was said at that point by that person? 
A. Just as I said before, that based on what they had been looking at, they said that the difference between murder and manslaughter involved malice, and that there was no malice involved in this particular case. 

Q. Is that the extent of your recollection as to what that person said? 
A. Yes. 

Q. That is the same juror referred to in your--
A. Yes. 

Q. --note, MFI 68? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Do you recall whether anything was said in response to that statement by the jury you've just referred to or not? 
A. Several jurors spoke at the same time. I can't remember exactly what anyone said in particular, but that's when I said to stop talking about it. 

Q. You recall the effect of what any other juror or jurors said in response or reaction to what the juror referred to in MFI 68 had said or not? 
A. No. 

Q. Can I approach it this way: Whatever was said in response by one or more jurors to what the juror, referred to in MFI 68 said, was it a discussion that dealt with what might be referred to as the subject matter or contents of what the legal research was, or was it not? 
A. No, they purely referred to malice, and manslaughter and murder, and legal definition.

Q. Again you use the word ""they"" to indicate one person? 
A. The one juror mentioned in line 2 of MFI 68. 

Q. You have already given the evidence as to what that juror said? 
A. Yes. 

Q. I suppose to make myself plain: After that person had said that, and before you closed down any discussion about it, as you said, do you recall whether any other juror or jurors said anything about the contents of any legal research or information that the juror had said he or she had obtained through undertaking Internet research? 
A. I can't recall if anyone said anything with regard to that. 

Q. Had any person or persons other than the juror in question said very much in response before you, as it were, closed down the discussion? 
A. No. 

Q. But you say there was more than one who started to respond? 
A. Yes. 

Q. How many? 
A. Four perhaps. 

Q. And are you able to say from your recollection as to whether anything said by any one of those four was on the subject of the contents of the legal research that the juror said he or she had undertaken? 
A. No, I couldn't say. 

Q. Is that because you do not have a recollection of 
A. No because they were all speaking at the same time. I don't remember what. 

Q. They were more or less talking over each other? 
A. Yes. 

Q. In a manner which may, are you saying, impossible to really say who was saying what at that time? 
A. Correct. 

Q. So as a person in the room, are you saying that by reason of the fact that more than one person was talking at the same time, it was really not possible to discern whatever words they uttered? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Meant or referred to? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And approximately how long, what interval existed between the other four, if there were four, starting to respond and talking over each other and you closing down discussion? 
A. Ten seconds. 

Q. Repeat if you would what did you say in trying to close down the discussion? 
A. I said I felt it was inappropriate to talk about it, that based on the facts of the case presented to us, and the judge's direction that we weren't to make outside inquiries as to the law. 

Q. Was that the end of this particular matter then? 
A. Yes. Well we continued to talk about it when I raised when I felt that I needed to write this letter. 

Q. In that last reference, was there any discussion as to the contents of any inquiry that the juror had made? 
A. No. 

Q. Yes thank you, would you hand the MFI 68 document please back to the Court officer? 
A. (Witness complied)

13The juror in question was sworn and gave answers to questions put to her in the examination as follows:

Q. Just before I ask you the matters that I want to inquire into, I just want to make clear that in answer to any of my questions please do not disclose any deliberations that have been going on in the jury room. In fact you must not disclose. I do not want to know, and I must not know anything about the jury deliberations. So if in answering these questions you could just focus on the point of my question, and just deal with those questions which are not concerned with the jury deliberations in terms of the matters and the issues that jury has to consider. 

The first matter I wanted to ask you about is your own inquiries, or researches, if any, undertaken by you, and firstly my question is: Have you undertaken some inquiry, whether it be matters of law or otherwise? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And would you just tell me the nature of the inquiry so that I understand? 
A. Can I show you that? 

Q. Yes (document handed to his Honour). Could you identify what it is so that everyone knows? 
A. It's just a thing that I looked on the Internet about manslaughter and murder, The differentiation, so I could understand it, that's all.

Q. You have written on the back of one of the documents, on I think the witness list? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Could I understand, what do these words capture, is it something you have copied it off? Is it copied from the Internet? 
A. It is a copy from the Internet. 

Q. Is it the 
A. From the New South Wales Law Society. I just needed to clarify manslaughter murder, murder manslaughter. I'm lost, and I just wanted to sort of 

Q. That's alright, I don't need to enquire into your reasons for it? 
A. That's all. 

Q. I see, so your notes here are notes taken from the website 
A. Yes. 

Q. The Law Society did you say? 
A. Yes. New South Wales. 

Q. And that deals with the distinction between manslaughter and murder? 
A. Mmm mmm. 

Q. Could I ask you when you 
A. Last night. 

Q. undertook that inquiry? 
A. Last night. 

Q. And is the web page on computer, your computer or 
A. Yes. 

Q. mobile phone? 
A. My computer. 

Q. Still there? 
A. It would be at home, yes. 

HIS HONOUR: Just pardon me while I read the note... Yes thank you. I will have that marked on the voir dire. 

EXHIBIT #1 ON THE VOIR DIRE 

Q. I take it that you first brought the notes, I will now call it Exhibit 1, to court this morning? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And 
A. I didn't do any I'm sorry if I did you something that I shouldn't. 

Q. I am simply enquiring into facts, nobody is you don't have any anything to fear about in terms of personal liability, I just want to put you at ease. This document, Exhibit 1, which have handwritten notes you have made from a website page, have you shown this to anyone? 
A. It was on my sort, of top of the table, and I think the lady somebody next to me glanced and said, ""What's that?"" I said, ""Just something"". I don't even think she saw what it was about. 

Q. This is in the jury room today? 
A. Yes. And then things progressed. 

Q. What do you mean by that, in terms of the matter? 
A. The foreman said, ""What are you doing?"" I said, ""I'm just looking at this, I'm just confirming something in my own mind"", and... to put it politely, him and me clash. 

Q. It's alright, you don't have to go there. Was anything said about the substance or the contents 
A. No. 

Q. of your Internet search in the jury room this morning? 
A. I didn't discuss it with anybody. The only person that discussed it with me was the foreman who said, ""You shouldn't be doing that"". 

Q. What happened when he said that? 
A. What happened, they turned around, and they they all sort of asked, ""What have you done?"" I said, ""I just looked up something on the Internet"", and he said, ""I'm going to tell the judge"", and I said, ""Do what you have to do"". And the others turned around and said, ""She's done nothing. All she did was confirm something to herself. She hasn't pushed it on any of us what it said"". 

Q. Is that the end of the discussion? 
A. As far as I was concerned, yes. 

Q. Was that early in the morning? Could you say approximately what time? 
A. That would have taken place I'd say about quarter to 10, 10 o'clock that I had it on my table. 

Q. Quarter to 10? 
A. Quarter to 10, 10 o'clock it was on the table. 

Q. This was in the jury room? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Were all jurors then in attendance, or 
A. No. There was a couple of missing. 

Q. Two missing. And could you say how long did any discussion concerning what I will call your Internet research took between quarter to 10 and 10 o'clock, in other words 
A. No I was just sitting there writing, and then it was pointed out to me I shouldn't have done it, and I said ""fair enough"" and I folded it up and put it in my book and just left it at that. He said, ""I have to report it"". I said, ""Okay, report it, if I've done wrong, I've done wrong"". 

Q. Before the foreperson said that to you, was anything said about what you had found on the website about your or following upon your research, by you? 
A. I think I turned around and I said, one word, I said which means whatever that word is 

Q. Just use your language. If you can recall what did you say? 
A. I turned around and said ""malice"" is the same as ""malice"" the same as what we've written up there. And he said, ""No it isn't"". I said, ""Well to me it is"". So that was my interpretation of it. 

Q. Did you refer him or did you refer at all to what you understood from your Internet research about the matter? 
A. No, not after that, I just used the one word, ""malice"", and that's all I used. 

Q. Did you have your 
A. My phone was there. 

Q. It's on your phone. And was your phone on the table? 
A. My phone was on the table, but it was in front of me like that, and I was writing it, because they take the phone off me, and I was just writing there, so I had it there for me, not for anybody else. 

Q. Do I understand you to say you had the phone on with the website page 
A. Yeah. 

Q. activated, and then you were taking notes from it at that time? 
A. No it wasn't activated on the Internet, it was something that I had written from the Internet onto my phone. 

Q. Onto your what? 
A. On to my iPhone, in the notes. It wasn't actually on the net. 

Q. So again, just to fully understand what you are saying, between quarter to 10 and 10 clock 
A. I had written this last night on my iPhone. 

Q. You had written out Exhibit 1, handwritten notes? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Then in that interval, between quarter to 10 and 10 o'clock, you had your phone on, the phone having 
A. Showing that page. 

Q. Showing what page? 
A. The page that I was writing onto the paper. But it was only a note page, it wasn't an Internet page. 

Q. I just want to understand. If I was looking at your phone at that time, what would I have seen? 
A. You would have seen that. What I've just written. Would you like me to go and get my phone and show you. 

Q. No it's alright. What I would have seen, you say, is the words that are appearing in Exhibit 1 in your handwriting? 
A. That's right. 

Q. And can I ask you, did any of your jurors look on to see either your handwritten notes, Exhibit 1, or 
A. The person next to me 

Q. Let me finish 
A. Sorry. 

Q. What was appearing on your phone at that time, or both? 
A. There was one person that looked at the phone and said ""What's that?"" I said, ""It's nothing, just something I looked up"". 

Q. Did you tell the person what that was that you looked up? 
A. No I did not. I did not tell the person. 

Q. That juror was sitting next to you? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And did you say anything to that person about anything recorded on the web page that you had consulted overnight? 
A. I just turned she said, ""What is it?"", I said, ""Something I was looking at on the Internet"". 

Q. Did you tell what it was? 
A. The she said, ""What?"" I said, ""Just something to do with manslaughter and murder"". That was it. I didn't say anything else. Maybe I should have come back to you, sorry, and asked for more confirmation. 

Q. That's alright. Were all jurors in attendance by about 10 o'clock? 
A. No. 

Q. By 10 o'clock? 
A. No.

Q. When did all jurors, all 12 
A. I'd say about 5 past 10. And my phone had already been taken off me by then.

Q. Taken off you? 
A. By the foreman. As soon as he saw it he took the phone off me. 

Q. By the foreman, or the court officer are you 
A. No, the foreman. The foreman took it off me before all the jurors had arrived. When he saw my phone, he looked at it, and he took it off me and he said, ""You're not supposed to be doing that"". 

Q. Now can I move on, so we have got the clear understanding: After all jurors were present in attendance at or about 5 past 10, through to lunchtime today, was there any other discussion about the information that you had obtained from the Internet search? 
A. I'd say about an hour, hour and a half into the morning. 

Q. And doing the best you can, I know it's difficult to recall exactly what was said, but doing the best you can, what did you say at about that time, if anything, on this matter? 
A. I didn't actually say anything. He turned around and said, ""I have to report it"". I said, ""Go ahead and report it"". And the other jurors said, ""What's he reporting?"" I said, ""Whatever I did on my iPhone and wrote on a piece of paper"". And the other jurors said well that's, you know, it's not relevant, she hasn't done anything wrong. 

Q. I suppose what I am really asking you, if you would just listen to this carefully: At this time, which was about what time? 
A. I'd say about an hour and a half after 10 o'clock, 11, 11.30ish. 

Q. So between 11 and 11.30. Between 11 and 11.30, when you say this subject came up again, what, if anything, did you say about the Internet research that you had undertaken, however brief, or however long, what did you say? 
A. I don't actually remember saying anything except if you have to report it, go ahead and report it. 

Q. Was there any discussion at this time that you are now referring to between about 11 and 11.30 as to the results of your Internet search by anyone? 
A. No. Only when he started writing the note, they all turned round and said, ""What are you writing, because we haven't asked for anything?"", and they all turned around and said, ""Well why are you doing it?"" 

Q. Did the foreperson say anything more on the subject of your Internet research? 
A. ""I have to report it"". I said, ""Go ahead and report it. I know I've done wrong"". 

Q. That is all he said on that subject? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did any other member of the jury say anything at that time about your Internet research material? 
A. No.

Q. Nothing? 
A. No. 

Q. By any other member? 
A. No. 

HIS HONOUR: I hand down Exhibit 1 to counsel (handed to counsel at the bar table) 

Q. Just one other question I want to ask you at this point: Was there any other discussion during the course of today on the subject of your Internet research other than what you have disclosed here this afternoon 
A. No.""

Submissions

14Mr Young's submissions addressed the following matters:

(1) The basis for the application was that it would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice;

(2) This case could be factually distinguished from R v Sio (No. 4) [2013] NSWSC 1415. In that case, Adamson J determined that the potential communication had not reached the stage where any research had been passed on or given rise to discussion between other jurors; 

(3) In the present case, what the discharged juror undertook resulted in the involvement of other jurors in a way that distinguishes it from R v Sio (No 4);

(4) The evidence on the examination established the following:

(i) The night before the examination the discharged juror conducted research on the internet in relation to the distinction between murder and manslaughter and the result of those researches were transferred to an iPhone; 

(ii) That information was carried into the jury room the next morning on the iPhone and before all the jury had assembled, the discharged juror was in the process of transcribing the information onto paper. 

(iii) There was some recognition of the piece of paper by the juror sitting next to the discharged juror who proceeded to inquire what it was about to which the discharged juror responded along the lines of ""it's got something to do with murder and manslaughter."" 

(iv) What she was doing was then brought to an end when she was interrupted by the foreperson who reminded her that her conduct was inappropriate;

(v) At some later stage, the discharged juror said something out loud about the significance of the word 'malice' in the context of her researches and that it was ""the same as what we've written up there"" and there was a response ""no, it's not"";

(vi) According to the foreperson, about four people at that stage involved themselves in the discussion but they were talking over the top of each other and it did not go on for a great period of time;

(5) The researches including the publication of the word 'malice' and any discussion derived from it takes the present case beyond the level that applied in R v Sio (No. 4). The present matter is in the category of cases where there is potentially a problem based on the publication of the results of researches;

(6) There are grave reservations about the effect this has had on the other jurors and what they perceived to be the relevance of 'malice' in terms of the directions that have already been given. 

15The Crown in oral submissions noted the following:

(1) The word 'malice' had not been mentioned in the trial. ""The intention to kill has been significantly disavowed, and these things are obvious. They are obvious and transcend that note of what she purports to - by its terms persuade others of the view"" (T156);

(2) The foreperson's note expressed a graver situation than what had actually occurred. The examination of both jurors established that the foreperson shut down the discussion swiftly, he took the juror's iPhone away and his evidence was that he did not have enough time or the opportunity to see what was on the iPhone;

(3) There is no risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice in the eleven jurors continuing their deliberations. Assuming the jury were true to their oath, they would recognise that any notion of malice were not in application in this trial. To the extent that the discharged juror proffered her opinion, it was in error;

(4) There is no evidence that the remaining jurors listened to her advice on the law, or that she developed an argument or in any respect verbally applied it to the facts as the jury would consider them;

(5) There appeared to be no realisation by the discharged juror that she engaged in misconduct and there was no reason to doubt her evidence that the matter was swiftly dealt with by the foreperson.

16In its written submissions the Crown referred to relevant case law authority and at [7] drew attention to the following matters:

""The present case is one where there has been publicity and the loss of life of a youth in violent circumstances likely to excite sympathy and emotion. The jury has presented as a conscientious one in its application to the daily hearing of evidence during the trial, and recently its requests for the evidence since retiring.

The present case involved a measure of publicity and media attention that was met by direction.

The present position is not one brought about by a delinquent investigation of the facts by a juror or jurors, the visits to a scene of crime, the seeking of advice from extraneous sources, or the extraneous use of scientific literature or opinion from outside of the jury room weighing into the area of impartiality or the wilful disregard of the oath to deliver true verdicts.

To discharge the jury would imply that the circumstances carry the substantial risk that jurors would ignore their oath to try the case on the evidence adduced and to ignore extraneous evidence. That does not represent the atmosphere of the trial.

Jurors will bring their general experience of life to bear on their deliberations without breaching the oath under the Jury Act or risking an unfair trial.

The ""rogue juror"" in the present was mounting an argument by impermissible means. Her proposed argument do not conform with the law and directions that before them, and in written form on the substantive law. Reasonable minds would recognise that she was departing from directions and plainly in error. The extraneous material was not authoritative in its terms by any measure likely to mislead or influence to act contrary to their duty.

The issues was diffused quickly and did not approach the characterisation of ""contamination"" of the jury individually or collectively.""

Exercise of the Relevant Discretion

17The provisions of s 53C(1)(a) are as follows:

""(1) If ... the court ... discharges a juror in the course of a trial ... the court ... must:

(a) discharge the jury if the court ... is of the opinion that to continue the trial ... with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice ...""

18The question then arising was whether the discharge of the single juror ought lead to the discharge of the whole jury, or whether I should order that the trial continue pursuant to s 53C of the Act. The question of the discharge of a single juror, and whether the whole jury ought be discharged, involves separate questions and issues and must be addressed distinctly: Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; 199 CLR 99 at [6] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J, [28]-[30] per McHugh J and [67] per Kirby J; R v Sio (No 4) [2013] NSWSC 1415 at [1].

19On Thursday, 31 October, I made an order in the following terms:

""I make an order pursuant to s 53C of the Jury Act that the trial continue with the remaining eleven jurors.""

20I stated that I would publish my reasons at a later time.

Consideration

21The resolution of the application requires, inter alia, an assessment of the information elicited from the foreperson and from the relevant juror during the examinations conducted under s 55DA of the Act as material relevant to the opinion required as to whether the trial should or should not continue with the remaining eleven jurors. The issues for specific consideration are specified in the provisions of s 53C(1)(a) as emphasised below, namely whether to continue the trial with the remaining jurors ""would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice"".

22The Crown submitted that I should not discharge the whole jury and that I should order that the trial continue with the eleven jurors pursuant to the provisions of the Act.

23Mr Young submitted that I should make an order that the trial should not continue before the remaining eleven jurors as to do so would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.

24The examinations of the foreperson and the discharged juror were directed to establishing the true facts in relation to the first and second episodes as to:

(i) What was said by the discharged juror as to or related to material obtained by her in her Internet research; 

(ii) Whether any material stored in the discharged juror's iPhone was seen by any juror, and 

(iii) The response or responses of any other juror to what she said or disclosed to fellow jurors or revealed in her handwritten notes (Exhibit 1 on the voir dire).

25Counsel for the Crown and the accused both accepted that the discharged juror had endeavoured to give a full and frank account of what had taken place in the jury room as to the information she had downloaded from the Internet website.

26The relevant facts accordingly are established by the information that was given in the examinations by the foreperson and the relevant juror in the course of their respective examinations.

27The foreperson gave a very satisfactory account of what occurred in the jury room and much of what he said in his examination was confirmed in material respects by the discharged juror.

28The information establishes:

(1) That the juror brought into the jury room on her iPhone material that she had downloaded from an Internet website.

(2) That prior to 10.00am on 30 October 2013 she was in the course of writing out the words appearing in Exhibit VD-1, and whilst doing so a juror sitting next to her asked what she was writing.

(3) There then followed the events in the two episodes as described above.

(4) The material brought to the jury room by the discharged juror involved material on matters of law not fact, namely, on the offences of murder and manslaughter. That material included reference to ""malice"" as a matter said to be relevant to the distinction between the offences of murder and manslaughter. The discharged juror then made a statement in relation to that particular aspect as indicated by her in the examination.

(5) The foreperson within a matter of seconds closed down the discussion as to the above matters in both the first and second episodes, he observing at the close of the second episode to his fellow jurors that a trial direction had been given that the jury was not to consider any material from outside the trial proceedings.

29The central issue for consideration is the nature of the material brought into the jury room and what was said about it or by reference to it by the discharged juror and what if anything was said in response by any of the other jurors.

30I am satisfied, based on the foreperson's account as well as that of the discharged juror, that neither the juror sitting next to the discharged juror nor any other juror had sufficient opportunity to actually read the text appearing on the iPhone during the first episode.

31The downloaded material, the handwritten notes made by the discharged juror (Exhibit VD 1), and anything said about such material related to legal concepts concerning the offences of murder and manslaughter, in particular, in that context to ""malice"". There was no other material on any other matter disclosed or discussed.

32The foreperson spoke in the jury room in direct terms, as outlined above, that there was to be no discussion of such material for the reason he stated and quickly put an end to the first and second episodes. He made it known to his fellow jurors that he was going to disclose what had occurred in a Jury Note.

33I have closely considered the specific matters to which s 53C(1)(a) requires consideration.

34I have determined, and I am of the opinion that, in accordance with s 53C(1) that to continue the trial with the remaining eleven jurors would not give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.

35The material in question, what I shall for convenience refer to as the ""impermissible material"", was in its entirety related to one legal matter concerning the offences of murder and manslaughter, namely ""malice"". The offending juror on one occasion proffered a brief expression of opinion based on that material. In both the first and second episodes the foreperson acted quickly and decisively to close down any discussion making it clear that such material could not be considered by the jury.

36The impermissible material is also to be considered in the context of what the jury have been told by counsel in closing addresses and the directions, including in particular the directions of law, given in the summing up.

37Counsel for the Crown, and Senior Counsel for the accused, gave the jury a clear outline of the elements of the offence of murder and the bases upon which the Crown proceeded in relation to it and as to the alternative offence of manslaughter.

38I provided the jury with both oral and written directions on the offence of murder upon the bases relied upon by the Crown in relation to that offence and upon the elements for the alternative offence of manslaughter.

39I have advised the jury on more than one occasion that it is open to them to ask for any further directions if required in order to clarify any matters concerning the legal directions given in the summing up. I note that there had been no reference during the trial, in particular in opening or closing addresses, or in the summing up, including trial directions, to ""malice"".

40In respect of the question as to whether the jury has understood the directions given I make the general observation that the jurors have throughout the trial demonstrated conscientiousness and close attention to the proceedings.

41In all of the circumstances to which I have referred the impermissible material and the discussion of it would not in my assessment give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. I do not consider such material and the limited reference to it by the discharged juror carried a risk of contamination in the sense of it misleading or confusing the jury as to the elements of the offence of murder or the alternative offence of manslaughter or otherwise. In my assessment the members of the jury understood the legal framework within which they are required to consider the case brought by the Crown, in particular the elements as set out under the headings 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the written directions. In that context relevant state of mind issues have been identified and discussed. I record in this context that in Jury Note MFI-58 the jury specifically sought clarification on aspects going to the accused's state of mind.

Order

42On 31 October 2013, I made an order in the following terms:

Pursuant to s 53C of the Jury Act I order that the trial continue with the remaining eleven jurors.

		21 March 2014",2013-10-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706006,R v MR [2013] NSWCCA 236,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Beech-Jones J and the additional observations of Schmidt J.

2SCHMIDT J: I have had the advantage of reading Beech-Jones J's draft judgment and adopt his Honour's explanation of the evidence and the parties' cases below and on appeal.

3For my part, I joined in the orders made at the hearing in relation to the evidentiary ruling, because I took the view that her Honour had erred in the conclusions which she reached as to the evidence the subject of the coincidence notice, in undertaking the evaluative exercise required by s 98 of the Evidence Act 2005, as explained in DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 259 FLR 262 and in the conclusion reached in relation to s 101 of the Evidence Act. The result of her Honour's decision was to substantially weaken the Crown's case and so the appeal had to be upheld (see s 5F(3A)). For reasons which Beech-Jones J explains, it followed that the appeal in relation to the severance order also had to be upheld.

4I agree with Beech Jones J's explanation of her Honour's error in relation to s 101 of the Evidence Act and with regard to s 5F(3A), but wish to explain the reasons for my conclusions in relation to her Honour's error in relation to s 98 of the Evidence Act.

5The Crown had sought to rely on the evidence identified in a coincidence notice to establish that the respondent was one of the offenders involved in each of the armed robbery offences (counts 1, 2, 3 and 5) and the car jacking offence the subject of count 4, as well as the police pursuit which is the subject of the s 166 certificate.

6'Coincidence evidence' is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act to be evidence of two or more events that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in s 98(1), which provides:

""(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.""

7Some of the events and circumstances relied on by the Crown below to support its coincidence notice were submitted to be similar and others to be 'strikingly' similar, so that it was unlikely that they had occurred coincidentally. Those in the first category were:

""a. each of the four targets were similar, being 'soft targets', that is late night fast food outlets and a late night bottle shop

b. each occasion involved 4 offenders, except count 2, which involved 2

c. the offenders were dressed similarly, typically wearing track pants and some form of hooded top

d. in counts 1,2 and 3 where there was CCTV footage, the person alleged to be the respondent was of similar height and weight and could be seen to move in a similar way.""

8Those which were submitted to be strikingly similar, were:

""a. on each occasion the same or similar group was involved

b. the clothing worn by the offenders on each occasion was striking:

In counts 1,2 and 5 the offenders wore distinctive 'Sean John' jumpers, it is alleged that the respondent wore such a jumper during count 2, such jumpers were found in the car after the police pursuit the subject of the s166 certificate charge and it follows were present, if not worn during the police pursuit (count 4)

In counts 1 and 2 R wore Puma track pants of a distinctive design. Those pants were later seized on search pf the respondent's home

In counts 1,3 and 5 at least one offender sought to disguise his clothing wearing his hooded jumper inside out

In at least count 1 and perhaps count 3 the inside out hoddie is consistent with that which the respondent can be seen wearing in police CCTV footage of 1 May (the dater of count 1, 14 May (the date of count 3), 15 may (the date of counts 4, 5 and the police pursuit). He is also seen wearing that hoddie in a photograph stored on the mobile phone alleged to be his (image 85)

In counts 1,2 and 5 a distinctive black backpack with red Adidas stripes was used. Such a backpack was found in the stolen car after the police pursuit and another two were found at the respondent's home

c. distinctive weapons were used in counts 1,2,3 and 5, namely a tomahawk and at least one knife. On the evidence out of 92 armed robberies between 1 and 30 May only the robberies the subject of these counts involved use of tomahawk.

d. in the hours preceding each offence the respondent is captured on CCTV footage wearing clothes in part if not entirely identical to those worn by the person alleged to be him: 

Count 1 - same shoes, track pants, and hooded jumper (reversed)

Count 2 - same track pants

Count 3 - same track pants and shoes

The police pursuit and therefore inferentially counts 4 and 5 - same shoes distinctive jeans (with a white 96 on the back left thigh) and jumper

e. counts 2,4,5 and the police pursuit, telephone material placing the respondent at each location where the crime was committed at the time it was committed

f. counts 2,4 and 5 telephone material placing the respondent at his home at the beginning of the sequence and between counts 4 and 5 and at the end of the sequence, after count 5

g. the police pursuit commenced when the stolen car it is alleged the respondent was driving aborted entry into the driveway of the apartment block where the respondent lives.""

9In my view her Honour's error in her approach to the exercise which s 98 required, flowed from her separate consideration of the evidence as to each of these events and circumstances, without necessary consideration being given to the evidence as a whole.

10The evidence as to the events and circumstances which on the Crown case could not have occurred coincidentally, was examined in order to determine whether it established similarities between the offences. What was not undertaken was the evaluative exercise required by s 98 by reference to all of the events and circumstances relied on, in order to determine whether it was improbable that they had occurred coincidentally.

11Her Honour's error was revealed by her conclusions that:

""I do not accept that the coincidental nature of the related events allows the inference to be drawn that all of the offences were committed by [MR]. Although there is circumstantial evidence relevant to each individual count, there is no evidence directly linking [MR] to one or more of these offences as there was in Ceissman [R v Ceissman [2010] NSWCCA 50]. In my view, there is nothing like the striking similarities, as were present in Ceissman, nor, for example in R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319, where the signature nature of the modus operandi was described as 'one of the most powerful examples of tendency and coincidence evidence' by Latham J in Ceissman. There was a very distinctive modus operandi in Ellis, which was also used in an offence for which Ellis had already been convicted.

Although the robberies in the present case had certain similarities, there were also some significant differences and there was nothing significant to distinguish them from other armed robberies where young men wearing hoodies, face masks of some description and carrying weapons such as knives and on occasions tomahawks, which are unfortunately relatively commonplace in Sydney. There is no evidence that the same axe or tomahawk was used, although there was an assertion that the tomahawk was found in the stolen Yaris. However, the Crown conceded during this hearing that the tomahawk was not found.""

12These conclusions were factually incorrect, as Beech-Jones J has explained. There was evidence which linked the respondent to each offence. In the case of some of the counts it was not strong, but in relation to others it was quite strong. Further, the evidence established that armed robberies involving a tomahawk are not commonplace and all those about which evidence was given involved at least some of the group of offenders of which, on the Crown case, the respondent was a member. As Latham J discussed in Ceissman at [14]:

""The fact that a series of offences are committed in a distinctive way by more than one offender does not necessarily deprive the evidence tending to establish those distinctive characteristics of its force. The relevantly similar or co-incidental features of the evidence may inform both the offences and the identity of the offender(s).""

13Even so, her Honour did find that the evidence established that the offences shared certain similarities. Thus, as Whealy JA explained in DSJ v R at [72], her Honour was 'required to take the evidence at its highest, and to determine whether it has the capacity to be of importance or of consequence in establishing the fact in issue'. As Latham J explained in Ceissman at [16] the test is one of capability, that is, is it open to the jury to conclude from the evidence that the offences were committed by the same offenders?

14That exercise, when the similarities which her Honour did not appreciate were taken into account, clearly revealed her Honour's error.

15The exercise required no evaluation of the actual weight of the evidence, or any prediction about the weight that might actually be assigned to any aspect of the evidence by the jury. What had to be assessed was the role that the evidence, if accepted, would play in the resolution of the disputed fact, that is its capacity to contribute to the resolution of the question of whether the respondent was one of those who participated in each offence.

16When the true nature of the evidence the subject of the coincidence notice was appreciated, the unavoidable conclusion was that, if the evidence was accepted, it did have the capacity to contribute to the resolution of the question of the respondent's participation in each offence. In the result it had to be concluded that the evidence had 'the capacity to rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue' in the case of each offence (s 55). Further, it was apparent that the evidence had the capacity to establish that fact.

17Consideration also had to be given under s 98(1)(b) to whether the occurrence of the events, which the Crown contended were unlikely to have occurred coincidentally, had significant probative value, that is, in rationally affecting the probability that the offences were committed by the same offenders.

18Her Honour considered that the evidence lacked significant probative value, but did not explain why. Given the evidence as to the use of the tomahawk in each of the four armed robberies, it was, however, clearly open to a jury to conclude that it was improbable that its use was coincidental and more likely to have been because the robberies involved common offenders. When that was considered with the other evidence connecting the respondent to the various offences, the significant probative value of the coincidence evidence the Crown sought to rely on, was apparent.

19The question of whether a hypothetical jury would be likely to find the evidence of importance, or of consequence, in coming to a conclusion about whether the respondent was one of the offenders involved in each of the offences the subject of the five counts and the s 166 notice, thus unarguably had to be answered yes. In the result the error into which her Honour fell was clear and the appeal had to be upheld.

20BEECH-JONES J: On 27 February 2013 the respondent, referred to in this judgment as ""MR"", was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment that contained five counts. Four of the counts alleged that he committed robbery whilst armed on each of 1 May 2011, 8 May 2011, 14 May 2011 and 16 May 2011 respectively contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The other count alleged that on 15 May 2011 he committed an offence contrary to s 154C(2) of the Crimes Act, commonly referred to as ""carjacking"". In addition MR had been charged with an offence concerning a police pursuit after the last robbery. The Court was not advised of the provision said to be contravened, although presumably it was s 51B of the Crimes Act. This is before the District Court to be dealt with in accordance with Division 7 of Part 3 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.

21On 5 March 2013 a District Court judge gave judgment following a voir dire. Her Honour ruled that certain evidence referred to in a ""coincidence notice"" served by the Crown was not admissible for coincidence purposes (the ""evidentiary ruling""). Her Honour also made orders severing the counts on the indictment and ordering separate trials on each of counts 1, 2 and 3 and a separate trial on counts 4 and 5 (the ""severance order"").

22The Crown appealed against the evidentiary ruling and against the severance order pursuant to ss 5F(3A) and 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 respectively. The appeal was heard on 19 September 2013. The Court was advised that MR's trial was listed to commence on 28 October 2013.

23At the conclusion of argument the Court allowed both appeals and ordered that:
1. The ruling of Quirk DCJ on 05.03.13 that the material set out in the coincidence notice dated 26.02.13 as amended is not admissible for coincidence purposes be set aside.

2. The material set out in the coincidence notice dated 26.02.13 as amended be admitted for coincidence purposes.

3. The order made by Quirk DCJ on 05.03.13 severing the counts on the indictment be set aside.

4. The notice of motion filed 27.07.12 by the respondent in proceedings number 2011/163025 be dismissed.

24The Court indicated that reasons for its decision would be given at a later time. What follows are my reasons for joining in the Court's orders of 19 September 2013.

The Crown case

25It is necessary to describe the Crown case in some detail.

26The first armed robbery was committed on the evening of Sunday, 1 May 2011, at a ""Hungry Jack's"" restaurant at Glenwood. CCTV footage depicts four males entering the restaurant. They stole $4,000 from the cash register which was placed into a black bag with three red stripes on one side. They also stole a patron's mobile phone. One of the offenders, said to be MR, was seen with a wooden handled axe. He was wearing a white hooded, dark coloured long sleeve jumper. He was also wearing black Puma pants with a white stripe three quarters down the outside of each leg and a Puma logo on one side. Two of the offenders were wearing black hooded jumpers with a white ""Sean John"" logo across the chest. One of these offenders was wearing tracksuit pants with white diagonal lines down the side. The fourth offender, said to be the co-accused ""K"", was holding a knife and wearing a white ""hoodie"" jumper with a black tag at the back of the neck, and grey track pants with black pocket lining and a logo on the right rear side of the pants. 

27The second armed robbery was committed at a ""McDonald's"" restaurant at Waitara in the evening of Sunday, 8 May 2011. There was both surveillance footage and eye witness evidence of the robbery. Two males were said to be involved. One of the offenders, said to be MR, was wearing the same style of Puma pants noted in [26] above. The offenders were armed with a knife and a tomahawk. One of them was carrying an Adidas brand backpack with three diagonal stripes. The offenders stole $400 in cash and an iPhone 3 mobile from an employee. The offenders left on foot and were seen to enter and leave in a red Honda Civic motor vehicle. A ""000"" call from the scene records one of the patrons recounting the registration plate of the vehicle as ""AL-45- VT"".

28The third armed robbery was committed at the ""Top Drop Bottle Shop"" at Seven Hills on the evening of Saturday, 14 May 2011. There was also CCTV footage and eye witness evidence for this robbery. It was committed by three males. One of them had a knife, another had a tomahawk and the other had a black backpack. 

29At around 9.35pm on Sunday, 15 May 2011, three males committed the carjacking. The victim stopped his black Toyota vehicle in the driveway of his home in Baulkham Hills. One of the three males demanded his keys. When he refused one of them attempted to punch him and missed, but the victim fell to the ground. He was kicked on the ground and the vehicle was stolen.

30The fourth armed robbery was committed later that evening at around 12.05am at a McDonald's restaurant at Croydon. It was captured on CCTV footage. Three offenders were seen to enter the restaurant. One was armed with a knife, another with an axe and the third was carrying a knife and an Adidas brand backpack with three red diagonal stripes. They stole $2,500 in cash. They escaped on foot and were seen to enter the Toyota vehicle that had been stolen earlier that evening. The Crown alleged that MR was the driver of the vehicle.

31Approximately fifteen minutes later police spotted the vehicle drive into a driveway at Blaxcell Street, Granville. A pursuit ensued. The stolen vehicle stopped, four occupants exited the vehicle and ran in different directions. Two of the occupants were apprehended, being the co-offenders N and Z. A police photo of the driver exiting is said to depict MR. His fingerprints were found on the outside of the rear passenger window. Located within the vehicle was $1,500 in cash, two black hooded jumpers with ""Sean John"" in white written across the front, and an Adidas brand black backpack with three red diagonal stripes. A beanie found in the vehicle contained DNA matched to a co-accused, K. One of the ""Sean John"" jumpers had DNA from one of the co-accused who was apprehended, Z. It is not clear whether a tomahawk was found inside the vehicle (see [48]).

32MR was arrested the next day, on 17 May 2011, while leaving the premises at Blaxcell Street, Granville. K was also arrested in the driveway of those premises. The Crown contends that he had in his possession the mobile phone that was stolen from an employee of the McDonald's restaurant during the second armed robbery. Furthermore, K was the registered owner of a red Honda Civic with the registration plate bearing the number ""AL-45-VY"". The similarity between that and the vehicle used in the second armed robbery was obvious (see [27).

33A search warrant was executed on a unit at the premises at Blaxcell Street, Granville. Police surveillance evidence indicated that MR and K lived at those premises. During the search there was located a pair of black Puma pants with a white stripe extending down three quarters of each leg. As stated, the CCTV footage of the first armed robbery and the second armed robbery shows one of the offenders wearing this style of pants. In addition, CCTV footage of MR reporting to a police station for bail in the afternoon before those robberies were committed shows him wearing that style of pants.

34Further, another search warrant was executed on premises at Werrington on or about 8 June 2011. Grey track pants similar to those worn by one of the offenders in the first armed robbery were seized from K.

35The Crown also collated some evidence concerning the usage of a mobile phone or at least a ""SIM card"" associated with MR. The surveillance commenced on 8 May 2011. It indicates that from around 7.27pm on 6 May 2011 the phone (or SIM card) was activated in the ""area"" of Waitara where the second armed robbery occurred. It appears that the cell tower that recorded the activity has a circle of coverage that is approximately 2 km in diameter. The phone or SIM card was also placed in the Baulkham Hills area at the time of the carjacking on 15 May 2011 and in the Croydon area at the time of the fourth armed robbery in the very early hours of 16 May 2011.

The coincidence notice

36It is evident from the above that there were obvious similarities between the four armed robberies. They were committed in the same general area. Each of the targets was either a fast food or drink outlet. They were each described as being ""soft targets"", in that they were busy retail outlets that could be expected to have cash that was readily available because of their dealings with the public. In each of the four robberies one of the offenders was carrying an axe or tomahawk. The evidence before her Honour was that the use of an axe in robberies was rare, although her Honour found to the contrary. A review of the CCTV footage reveals that the offenders were dressed similarly. As indicated, one of the offenders, said by the Crown to be MR, was wearing ""Puma"" pants with a white stripe extending three quarters of the way down the trouser leg in the first and second robberies. In both the first, second and fourth robberies, two of the offenders were wearing black hooded jumpers with a ""Sean John"" logo across the front (in the likeness of those found in the stolen Toyota).

37In this Court counsel for MR conceded that there was no doubt that the robberies were ""similar"" in the sense that they were committed by the same group or subgroup of offenders, but contended that the question was whether there was ""enough evidence to include [MR] in them"". The concession of similarity was undoubtedly correct although it does not appear that the matter was argued before her Honour on that basis. 

38On or about 26 February 2013 a solicitor from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions sent to MR's solicitors a document entitled ""Notice: Coincidence evidence"". The notice attached a schedule summarising the evidence pointing to MR's and the co-offenders' connection to each of the offences. The notice referred to ""two or more events"" which were the ""presence of [MR's] mobile telephone in close proximity"" to various locations of relevance to the offences, the similarity in clothing between that either worn by or connected to MR and his co-offenders and that said to be used in the armed robberies, and the similarity in the weapons and other items used in the armed robberies (and their connection to MR and the other offenders). The notice stated that this evidence was sought to be tendered to prove that MR ""did a particular act, namely the Glenwood robbery, the Waitara McDonald's robbery, the Top Drop robbery, the carjacking, the Croydon McDonald's robbery, and the police pursuit"".

39Senior Counsel for the Crown conceded the notice utilised ""unusual drafting"". In particular, it is not easy to ascertain from the notice exactly what are the ""events"" for the purposes of s 98 that the Crown contended it was improbable ""occurred coincidentally"", and what was said to be the evidence of that ""event"". In any event neither before her Honour nor before this Court was any point taken concerning the form of the notice.

40At the commencement of the voir dire, the Crown provided written submissions. They identified the relevant ""events"" as being the offences on the indictment, and clarified that the Crown contended that it was improbable that they occurred ""coincidentally - that is, it is improbable that the offences in the indictment were committed by different person[s]"". Instead the Crown contended they were committed by the same group or subgroup of offenders. In effect the Crown contended that the jury could reason from a demonstrated connection between MR and one or more of the offences on the indictment and the similarities between the armed robbery offences that he was involved in all of the offences. (It was common ground that the carjacking should be considered together with the fourth armed robbery.) In the end result this meant that the voir dire was conducted on the basis that what was in issue was the admissibility of all the evidence on each of counts 1, 2 and 3 as well as 4 and 5 (considered together) as evidence on the other counts by the use of coincidence reasoning of the kind referred to in s 98(1). The evidentiary ruling and this Court's orders should be so understood. 

41The Crown's written submissions on the voir dire identified some matters that were described as ""similarities"" and others as ""striking similarities"" between the armed robbery offences. The former were said to be the nature of the targeted retail outlet, the number of offenders, being four in the case of both the first and fourth armed robbery offences, the clothing used, and that the person alleged to be the accused in each offence had similar height and weight and appeared to move in a similar way. The latter was said to comprise the particular clothing worn in some of the offences, the distinctive weapons that were used, especially the tomahawk, the telephone surveillance material, and the parking of the car stolen in the carjacking in the driveway at the residence of MR and K after the police pursuit.

42Finally, one of the ""striking"" similarities was said to be the fact that ""on each occasion, the same - or similar - group was involved"". This was a reference to the evidentiary schedule attached to the coincidence notice pointing to the involvement of each of the accused, including MR, in the offences. On its face this suggests that there was a circular aspect to this and some of the other assertions by the Crown in that, as expressed, the alleged fact of MR's involvement in each offence was being pointed to as a similarity between the armed robbery offences in an effort to prove that MR was involved in them. 

43However, as a matter of substance, not all of this aspect of the Crown's reasoning in this respect was circular. There was an overlap between some of the alleged similarities between the identified events and the matters said to connect MR to those armed robberies. For example, according to the Crown one similarity between counts 2, 4 and 5 was the presence of MR's mobile phone or SIM card in the area of the carjacking offence and the second and fourth armed robbery offences around the time they were committed. That said, both the coincidence notice and the Crown's submissions before her Honour reveal a failure to delineate between identifying similarities between the armed robberies and matters pointing to a connection between MR and any particular offence.

Her Honour's judgment

44The voir dire occupied four days with submissions concluding on 4 March 2013. Her Honour gave ex tempore reasons the next day, on 5 March 2013. After reciting aspects of the Crown case and the terms of the coincidence notice, her Honour referred to the Crown's submissions, noted above. Her Honour noted that some aspects of the offences were said to bear ""similarities, albeit not striking ones"" and then noted the matters said by the Crown to be ""striking similarities"". 

45Her Honour addressed each alleged similarity. Her Honour noted that there were a different number of offenders in the second and third armed robberies (two and three respectively) and it was not known whether there was a driver involved in the first armed robbery offence. In so far as the Crown relied on the alleged physical similarity of the person said to be the offender in each offence, her Honour considered that contention but gave it little force given the ""resolution and clarity of the CCTV images"". Her Honour compared video taken of MR at Parklea Gaol and concluded that there was nothing ""particularly distinctive about the person"" alleged to be MR in each offence.

46In relation to the alleged ""striking similarity"" arising out of the use of distinctive weapons, especially the tomahawk, her Honour recounted that the officer in charge of the investigation had given evidence that of the 92 armed robberies reported to police between 1 and 30 May 2011 only four had involved a tomahawk, being the those the subject of these proceedings. However her Honour further noted:
""However, evidence given by the officer in charge during cross examination reveals that there were also two earlier robberies in which a tomahawk was used, namely one on 31 March at a service station at Pendle Hill where one of the two robbers had an axe and the other a knife and are identified as two offenders nominated in these matters, [Z] and [N], and in another robbery on 4 April 2011 an axe was employed and a person not said to be involved in these offences, by the name of [H], has been arrested in respect of that matter. It is not asserted, as I understand it, that this accused, [MR], was implicated in those two earlier robberies.""

In relation to the robbery on 4 April 2011 referred to in this passage, the evidence of the officer in charge was that all three of MR's alleged co-offenders were involved in that offence along with another person, being H.

47In relation to the distinctive clothing said to have been worn by MR in the first to third armed robberies, especially the Puma pants, her Honour found that it was a matter that ""could connect or link the accused to those individual counts"", but added that it ""do[es] not disclose ... striking similarities between the counts themselves"". In relation to the ""Sean John"" hoodies, her Honour noted that ""there was nothing to connect [MR]"" with wearing them such as the DNA. Otherwise her Honour accepted a submission made on behalf of MR that the clothing and backpack worn or carried by the offenders were ""commonly available in shopping centres throughout the State and are not particularly striking"". Finally her Honour noted that the evidence concerning his mobile phone and cell tower records ""is circumstantial evidence which, taken at its highest, places [MR] in the vicinity of and could implicate him in three of the five robberies"".

48Her Honour's conclusion in relation to the evidence was as follows:

""The principal fact in issue in the present case is ultimately whether [MR] took part in each of the five armed robberies, either by physically taking part in the robbery itself or being involved as a driver in Count 5 and possibly Count 4. To put it another way, was [MR] one of four armed robbers in Count 1, one of two armed robbers in Count 2, one of three armed robbers in Count 3 and either one of the three men who approached and car-jacked the victim in Count 4 or was somewhere nearby, and was the driver, although not one of the armed robbers, in Count 5.

I do not accept that the coincidental nature of the related events allows the inference to be drawn that all of the offences were committed by [MR]. Although there is circumstantial evidence relevant to each individual count, there is no evidence directly linking [MR] to one or more of these offences as there was in Ceissman [R v Ceissman [2010] NSWCCA 50]. In my view, there is nothing like the striking similarities, as were present in Ceissman, nor, for example in R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319, where the signature nature of the modus operandi was described as 'one of the most powerful examples of tendency and coincidence evidence' by Latham J in Ceissman. There was a very distinctive modus operandi in Ellis, which was also used in an offence for which Ellis had already been convicted.

Although the robberies in the present case had certain similarities, there were also some significant differences and there was nothing significant to distinguish them from other armed robberies where young men wearing hoodies, face masks of some description and carrying weapons such as knives and on occasions tomahawks, which are unfortunately relatively commonplace in Sydney. There is no evidence that the same axe or tomahawk was used, although there was an assertion that the tomahawk was found in the stolen Yaris. However, the Crown conceded during this hearing that the tomahawk was not found.

...

I find that the evidence sought to be adduced as coincidence evidence lacks significant probative value and, therefore, does not meet the threshold requirements of s 98."" (emphasis added)

49Her Honour also addressed s 101 of the Evidence Act 1995, finding as follows:

""In any event, as the defence submits, applying the test in s 101(2), even had I found that the evidence had significant probative value, the application of that test would lead to a decision that the probative value of the evidence does not substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused. There is a real risk that prejudice may arise from possible speculation and assumption by a jury in relation to the proposed coincidence evidence. As I have already said, the striking similarities in Ceissman are not present here and there are a number of significant differences between each of the counts and even in the alleged role of the accused. The defence will assert that the pool of offenders from which the actual offenders in these counts come was more numerous and that some of its members may have been involved in other offences as set out above.

In the present case, the evidence implicating the accused, particularly in relation to Counts 1 and 3, is of little significant probative value and there is a real danger that the jury would use the proposed coincidence evidence and conclude, despite any directions of law, that the accused was one of the offenders involved in each of these offences.""

50Finally her Honour addressed MR's application to sever the counts on the indictment and found:

""The accused seeks orders that Counts 1, 2 and 3 each be heard separately from the other counts and Counts 4 and 5 be heard together but separately from Counts 1, 2 and 3. In respect to the separate trials issue, it was said by Brennan J in R v Sutton [sic] [1984] 152 CLR 5:

'When two or more counts constituting a series of offences of a similar character are joined in the same information, a real risk of prejudice to an accused person may arise from the adverse effect of which evidence of his implication in one of the offences charged in the indictment is likely to have upon the jury's mind in deciding whether he is guilty of another of those offences. Where that evidence is not admissible towards proof of his guilt of the other offence, some step must be taken to protect the accused person against the risk of impermissible prejudice. Sometimes a direction to the jury is sufficient to guard against such a risk; sometimes it is not. Where a direction to the jury is not sufficient to guard against such a risk, an application for separate trials should generally be granted.'

I am satisfied that the jury's conclusion on any one matter is likely to bear upon its conclusion on other related matters, despite any directions to the contrary, and I order separate trials as sought in the notice of motion.""

Subsections 5F(2) and (3A)

51As stated, the Crown's appeal against the evidentiary ruling was brought pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act and the appeal against the severing of the counts on the indictment was brought under s 5F(2). Section 5F states:

""5F Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order

...

(2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies.

...

(3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case.""

52Thus a threshold question arose in relation to the appeal under s 5F(3A), namely whether the relevant ruling eliminated or substantially weakened the ""prosecution's case"". 

53In R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 at [40] Spigelman CJ stated that the Court should address s 5F(3A) ""on the assumption that the jury accepted the evidence, as long as the evidence was fit to be left to the jury"" and that no investigation of the credibility or reliability of the evidence in question should be undertaken. Shamouil involved a successful Crown appeal against the exclusion under s 137 of the Evidence Act of an out of court photoboard identification of the accused.

54Thus in most appeals under s 5F(3A) the threshold question is addressed by considering the effect of the rejected evidence on the assumption that it is before the jury and without regard to questions of credibility or reliability. However one feature of s 98(1) is that it is an exclusionary rule that prevents evidence being before a jury for a particular purpose unless it has significant probative value. If the Court was to conclude that the primary judge was correct to find that s 98(1) was not satisfied in relation to the evidence the subject of this appeal because, irrespective of matters of weight or reliability, it does not have significant probative value, then at least in this case it would necessarily follow that a Crown case that was denied that evidence would not be substantially weakened. However it is not necessary to consider this further because I consider that the primary judge was in error and that her Honour was bound to find that the evidence had significant probative value.

55Otherwise it is apparent from the recitation of the Crown case above that, if the evidence in respect of counts 4 and 5 is not available in respect of each of counts 1, 2 or 3, then the Crown case on each of those counts is substantially weakened. The evidence directly connecting MR to each of those latter counts is not particular strong. With count 3, ie the third armed robbery, it only consists of some similar clothing.

56However, the evidence directly connecting MR to counts 4 and 5 is very strong and almost overwhelming. His fingerprints were found on the car stolen in the carjacking and used in the fourth armed robbery. The car was eventually parked at premises he resided in along with K. His mobile phone was in the vicinity of the McDonald's restaurant in Croydon at the time of the robbery. There is said to be a picture of him exiting the car during the police pursuit. If that evidence is available to be used with counts 1, 2 and 3 via the use of the type of reasoning referred to in s 98(1), as explained at [40], then the prosecution case on each of counts 1, 2 and 3 is considerably strengthened. However the reverse conclusion does not apply with counts 4 and 5. 

57No argument was directed to whether the reference to the ""prosecution's case"" in s 5F(3A) is a reference to every count on an indictment, one count or some other concept. It seems likely that it is a reference to the ""prosecution's case"" as presented, ie every count. Further, in this case the Crown also appealed the order severing the counts on the indictment. The sole basis for that decision was the evidentiary ruling. Given that circumstance, the correctness of the evidentiary ruling in respect of all counts can also be challenged as part of the appeal under s 5F(2).

58One further matter should be noted. Neither form of appeal invoked by the Crown requires a grant of leave. It follows that, even if any error on the part of the trial judge was caused by or contributed to by the Crown, that does not enable the Court to avoid determining the appeal, although it could affect the discretion to grant relief under s 5F(5) of the Criminal Appeal Act in an appropriate case. It is unnecessary to consider this further as it was not submitted that any relief should be refused to the Crown on some discretionary basis by reason of anything that was done or not done at first instance.

Coincidence evidence

59Sections 55, 95, 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act provide:

""55 Relevant evidence

(1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.

(2) In particular, evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to:

(a) the credibility of a witness, or

(b) the admissibility of other evidence, or

(c) a failure to adduce evidence.

...

95 Use of evidence for other purposes

(1) Evidence that under this Part is not admissible to prove a particular matter must not be used to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.

(2) Evidence that under this Part cannot be used against a party to prove a particular matter must not be used against the party to prove that matter even if it is relevant for another purpose.

...

98 The coincidence rule

(1) Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:

(a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or

(b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.

...

101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

(3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.

(4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.""

60The above form of s 98 was introduced into the Evidence Act with effect from 1 January 2009 by the operation of the Evidence Amendment Act 2007 (Act No 46 of 2007; s 3 and schedule 1). It replaced the form of s 98 that was considered in R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504, which provided:

""98 The Coincidence Rule

(1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if:

(a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, or

(b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if:

(a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and

(b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar.

(3) Subsection 1(a) does not apply if:

...""

61Section 98 in both of its forms was intended to establish an exclusionary rule that is designed to prevent the adducing of evidence for a particular purpose or, more accurately, that seeks to invoke a particular form of probabilistic reasoning designed to establish a particular fact or state of mind, unless it has significant probative value. Thus the current provision refers to the tendering of evidence on a particular ""basis"". The former provision used the phrase ""not admissible to prove ... because"", which directed attention to the reason the adducing party sought to adduce the evidence. 

62Subsection 3(3) of the Evidence Act provides that certain reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission concerning the Act and amendments made to it may be used as an aid to interpretation. In ""ALRC Report 102: Uniform Evidence Law Report"" at [11.20] to [11.25] the Commission discussed the proposal that led to the introduction of the current form of s 98. At [11.25] it stated:

""The intention of the proposal is that s 98 will apply where the tendering party argues that the evidence is relevant to the issues in the case on the basis of improbability reasoning and that reasoning turns on similarities between the events, or in the circumstances surrounding these events, or both.""

63It is apparent from the discussion in that report, which in turn refers to the discussion in Chapter 10 of ""ALRC Discussion Paper 69: Review of the Uniform Evidence Act"" (""DP 69""), that there was a concern that the former s 98 was too narrowly expressed. In particular it was thought that s 98 was not engaged in many circumstances where the tendering party sought to rely on coincidence reasoning that invoked similarities between events and the circumstances surrounding them, but those similarities were not such as to fall within former s 98(2) (DP 69 at [10.21]). In those circumstances, assuming the evidence said to support this reasoning passed the threshold requirement of relevance found in s 55, the question of whether or not it should be excluded or admitted fell to be determined according to the discretions conferred by ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act, but not by s 98. In that regard it is important to note that s 137 does not apply to civil proceedings, whereas s 98 does.

64Nevertheless, even the rule created by the current form of s 98(1) does not apply to all forms of probabilistic reasoning that seek to disprove a contention that various things may have happened coincidentally. In this case the fourth armed robbery is an obvious example. It is apparent from the above that there is a strong collection of circumstantial evidence directly linking MR to that count including his fingerprints on the car used as a getaway for the fourth armed robbery, the presence of his mobile phone in the area of the robbery at or near the time of the offence, the fact that the car was ultimately parked in the driveway of a place he resided in and his connection to some of his alleged co-offenders, two of whom were caught red-handed in the chase after the robbery occurred. Some of these matters may be capable of explanation on the basis that they are mere coincidences, however it appears difficult to explain the presence of all of them. However, if the Crown only sought to rely on these matters to establish MR's guilt on counts 4 and 5, that would not engage s 98(1). Even if the various matters suggesting he committed those offences could be characterised as ""events"", no part of any such reasoning involves any attempt to prove his involvement on the ""basis"" that it was improbable that those events occurred coincidentally ""having regard to any similarities in [those] events or the circumstances in which they occurred"".

65One textual difference between the former s 98 and the current s 98 concerns the location within the section of the reference to ""similarities"" between the two or more events and the circumstances surrounding the events. Former s 98 was only engaged if the evidence concerned ""two or more related events"", as defined in s 98(2). Thus in Zhang at [140] Simpson J identified an ""anterior step"" to considering whether the evidence had ""significant probative value"", namely ""determin[ing] whether two or more events the subject of the tendered evidence are substantially and relevantly similar and whether the circumstances in which they (are alleged to have) occurred are substantially similar"" (see also R v Ceissman [2010] NSWCCA 50 at [8] per Latham J).

66Under the current version of s 98 there is no longer a threshold or anterior inquiry of this kind. This reflects the apparent purpose of the amendment, which was to broaden the body of evidence that engaged s 98 and subject it to the test of having significant probative value. However, although the anterior inquiry identified in Zhang at [140] is no longer applicable, it is still necessary at the outset for the tendering party to identify the reason they seek to tender the evidence in question in order to establish whether it is seeking to invoke the ""basis"" referred to in s 98(1). As part of that process the tendering party will need to identify the ""events"" that are said to have occurred, the particular act or state of mind that it is said that the evidence of the events proved, the relevant similarities that are to be relied upon and the reasoning process that is sought to be engaged. 

67When these matters are specified the Court can then address ss 55 and 98. In DSJ at [66] Whealy JA (with whom Bathurst CJ, Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J agreed) approved, subject to three qualifications, the following propositions that had been distilled by Simpson J in Zhang (at [139]) concerning the determination of whether evidence caught by s 98 satisfies the test of relevance in s 55 and significant probative value in s 98(1):

""(i) coincidence evidence is not to be admitted if the court thinks that evidence would not, either by itself, or having regard to other evidence already adduced, or anticipated, have significant probative value;

(ii) probative value is the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue (see the Dictionary to the Evidence Act);

(iii) the actual probative value to be assigned to any item of evidence is a question for the tribunal of fact - here, the jury;

(iv) the probative value actually to be assigned to any item of evidence cannot finally be determined until all of the evidence in the case is complete;

(v) the task of the judge in determining whether to admit evidence tendered as coincidence evidence is therefore essentially an evaluative and predictive one. The judge is required, first, to determine whether the evidence is capable of rationally affecting the probability of the existence of a fact in issue; second (if that determination is affirmative) to evaluate, in the light of any evidence already adduced, and evidence that is anticipated, the likelihood that the jury would assign the evidence significant (in the sense explained by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457) probative value. If the evaluation results in a conclusion that the jury would be likely to assign the evidence significant probative value, the evidence is admissible. If the assessment is otherwise, s 98 mandates that the evidence is not to be admitted."" (emphasis in original)

68The first qualification was that s 98 had been amended since the decision in Zhang (DSJ at [67]). DSJ concerned the current form of s 98, whereas Zhang concerned the previous version set out in [60]. Whealy JA stated that the ""differences [between the two versions] need to be factored in"". I have already identified one difference flowing from that change (at [65] to [66]). 

69The second qualification was to note that the discussion in Zhang was not meant to ""supplant or replace the language of the section"" but was instead directed to explaining the process to be undertaken by a trial judge (DSJ at [67]).

70The third qualification was that the second part of the fifth proposition in Zhang concerning the assessment of ""significant probative value"" was reformulated as follows (at [72]):

""... if a hypothetical jury would think it unlikely that the evidence were important in relation to the facts in issue then the trial Judge might the more readily conclude that the evidence lacks the capacity required for admissibility. Simpson J's formulation [in Zhang] recognises that the trial Judge has no part to play in the evaluation of the actual weight to be given to any of the evidence or to its ultimate assessment. The substance of her Honour's formulation is that the trial Judge is required to take the evidence at its highest, and to determine whether it has the capacity to be of importance or of consequence in establishing the fact in issue. In undertaking that task, the statute also requires, as her Honour recognised, that the evidence may be examined on its own account, or by having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the tendering party."" (emphasis added)

71Furthermore, DSJ confirms that in evaluating whether the evidence has significant probative value the trial judge must consider, by reference to the evidence itself or other evidence adduced by the tendering party, the existence of alternative inferences inconsistent with guilt, although they are not to consider evidence tendered by the resisting party nor weigh the credibility or the reliability of the evidence (DSJ at [10] per Bathurst CJ, at [11] per Allsop P, at [130] per Whealy JA, at [135] per McClellan CJ at CL and [136] per McCallum J).

72The application of s 98(1) in its current form can be illustrated by the facts in Ceissman. Ceissman involved a Crown appeal from, inter alia, the rejection of coincidence evidence. The respondent to the appeal faced 22 charges arising out of ""five separate criminal enterprises"", each said to have been committed by two men and to have various similarities such as the identity of the premises that were robbed, the method of gaining access, the timing of the robbery and the clothing worn, etc (at [3]). The identity of one of the offenders was known and the only issue was whether the respondent was the other one. 

73At [8] of Ceissman, Latham J noted that the trial judge had correctly undertaken the anterior inquiry described in Zhang, but which is no longer applied. Then, by reference to the two stage test set out in the fifth proposition from Zhang noted above at [67], Latham J identified the reasoning sought to be relied on by the Crown in that case and the trial judge's obligation as follows (at [15] to [16]):

""In my view, the Judge erred in a number of ways. First, in considering whether the evidence was capable of rationally affecting the probability of the respondent's participation in the offences, the Judge conflated the two steps in the analysis set out in Zhang. The chain of reasoning sought to be advanced by the Crown is:- 

(i) The co-incidental and tendency nature of the 'related events' allows the inference to be drawn that the offences were committed by the same offenders.

(ii) The respondent is one of the offenders in two of the robberies (DNA on items worn during the commission of those offences).

(iii) The respondent was the taller of the two men in all five robberies ([the co-offender's] evidence).

(iv) The respondent is implicated in four of the robberies by circumstantial evidence (the 'bad teeth' of one of the offenders described by two witnesses in respect of separate robberies, telephone intercepts between [the co-offender] and the respondent disclosing planning of the offences, and the pink gloves worn in two robberies).

(v) The combination of the foregoing establishes the respondent's guilt of all of the offences beyond reasonable doubt. 

The evidence of the 'related events' is capable of rationally affecting the probability that the offences were committed by the same offenders (i). The test is one of capability, that is, is it open to the jury to conclude from the 'related events' that the offences were committed by the same offenders: R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112 at [61] to [65]. The answer to that question in this case is clearly yes. The second stage of the analysis [from Zhang] is to combine the 'related events' with the other evidence relied upon ((ii) to (iv)) and pose the question, having regard to all of the evidence, is the jury likely to assign the evidence of the 'related events' significant probative value. Again, I would answer that question in the affirmative.""

74In this passage her Honour identified how the evidence of the related events was capable of proving the first step in the reasoning process sought to be relied on by the Crown in that case so as to satisfy s 55; ie that the offences were committed by the same offenders. Her Honour then explained how the test of significant probative value was applied to that evidence by having regard to the evidence concerning steps (ii) to (v). Consistent with the former (and current s 98), the test of significant probative value was assessed in relation to its capability of proving that a person ""did a particular act or had a particular state of mind"", in that case the commission of the offences in question. This second step was the relevant part of Zhang that was reformulated by Whealy JA in DSJ, but that reformulation does not affect this part of Latham J's analysis. 

75Ceissman illustrates how it is important to distinguish between the two steps noted in Zhang and endorsed in DSJ. In particular the relevant ""fact"" at each step of the analysis is not necessarily the same. This is so because s 55 establishes a threshold for relevance assessed against a ""fact in issue"" whereas s 98 is directed to evidence being ""admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind"". There is an obvious analogy between the facts in Ceissman and this matter although one potentially important difference is that in Ceissman the number of offenders for each offence was the same whereas in this case it is different. This is further addressed below at [95]. 

76Two further matters should be noted about the assessment of significant probative value.

77First, there is nothing in the statutory scheme or the authorities that requires that, before evidence of the events can be assessed as having significant probative value, the events or the circumstances in which they occurred have ""striking"" similarities or the like. This is confirmed by the brief history of the current form of s 98 set out above which reveals that the section was amended to expand the evidence that was to be the subject of the test of having significant probative value, but not necessarily require its exclusion.

78The assessment of whether the evidence has significant probative value must address the basis upon which the evidence is sought to be tendered. This in turn requires a consideration of the suggested similarities between the identified events and the circumstances in which they occurred to ascertain whether, when taken with any other evidence that is led or to be led by the adducing party, they have the ""capacity to be of importance or of consequence in establishing the fact in issue"" (DSJ at [72]). No doubt in many, if not most, cases the stronger the similarities between the events and their circumstances and the greater their number the more likely that the tendering party will satisfy the statutory test, depending on what particular fact was sought to be proved and what other evidence is to be adduced. However, neither any individual similarity, nor any collection of similarities, must answer the description ""striking"".

79Second, given that s 98 is addressing evidence that is put forward to invite the trier of fact to engage in a particular form of probabilistic reasoning, it necessarily follows that the assessment of whether the evidence of the relevant events has either probative or significant probative value requires a consideration of the combined effect of all the relevant similarities. Unless they are all considered then the ""basis"" upon which the evidence is put forward, namely that it is ""improbable that the events occurred coincidentally"" and that instead the events are explicable by reason of the particular act or state of mind sought to be proved, such as the involvement of the same offender or offenders in all the events, cannot be properly addressed.

The Crown's appeal against the evidentiary ruling

80In support of its appeal against the evidentiary ruling, the Crown raised four points. First, it contended that her Honour applied the wrong test in assessing significant probative value in the passages set out in [48] above. Second, the Crown contended that her Honour failed to consider the totality of the suggested similarities between the armed robberies and the circumstances in which they occurred. Third, the Crown contended that her Honour erred in dismissing the relevance of the use of a tomahawk in the armed robberies. Fourth, the Crown contended that her Honour erred in finding that the evidence should be rejected under s 101 ""in any event"".

81I will address the first three points made by the Crown together. Her Honour's reasons for concluding that s 98(1)(b) was not satisfied are described in [44] to [48] above. As noted, her Honour individually addressed each of the similarities suggested by the Crown. Although her Honour did not expressly say so, her Honour considered whether each one's occurrence at some or all of the armed robberies was coincidental or pointed to the fact in issue, which her Honour identified as MR's involvement. Subject to what follows, there was nothing objectionable in her Honour examining each of the suggested similarities individually at least at the outset. 

82As noted at [46], in addressing the relevance of the tomahawk her Honour noted that a tomahawk had been used in two other robberies said to have involved two of the co-offenders approximately one month prior to the robberies said to involve MR. Her Honour noted that MR was not said to be involved in those robberies. Later, her Honour appeared to refer to the use of tomahawks as ""relatively commonplace in Sydney"".

83This aspect of her Honour's reasoning reveals that her Honour overlooked the ""basis"" upon which the evidence was being put forward by the Crown, and committed the same error as the trial judge in Ceissman, namely ""conflat[ing] the two steps in the analysis set out in Zhang"" (Ceissman at [15] per Latham J). 

84Leaving aside the circular aspect noted at [42], the first step in the chain of reasoning put forward by the Crown was that the same group or subgroup of offenders had committed each of the four armed robberies. The second step was that there was some direct evidence that MR was involved in each of the offences. The third step was that the combination of those two matters meant that, according to the Crown, it was established beyond reasonable doubt he was involved in all of the offences. These steps are analogous to those identified by Latham J in Ceissman at [15] (see [73]) subject to the qualification that in Ceissman the number of offenders involved in each offence was constant. 

85The presence of the tomahawk at the scene of each of the four armed robberies was clearly a similarity between the armed robberies. It was a matter relevant to the first step in the Crown's reasoning. On its face, its presence was unlikely to be coincidental but was more likely to be as a result of the offences being committed by a common group or subgroup of offenders. If the evidence adduced by the Crown revealed that a tomahawk was the weapon of choice for a substantial number of unrelated armed robberies, then that was a matter tending to suggest that its presence at these four was more likely to be coincidental. However the fact that it was used by two of the alleged co-offenders in another two robberies a month earlier did not tend to suggest that its presence at these four armed robberies was coincidental. To the contrary, it reinforced the Crown's contention that it was as a result of those offenders or close associates of theirs being involved in the armed robberies the subject of this appeal. 

86By itself the presence of a tomahawk at the scene of the robberies does not point to MR's involvement in these robberies, but the Crown did not contend that it did. Instead the presence of the tomahawk was a matter suggesting that the robberies were committed by the same group or subgroup. The first stage of the test in Zhang required her Honour to consider whether that similarity (and others) was ""capable of rationally affecting the probability that the offences were committed by the same offenders"" (Ceissman at [16]) or a subgroup thereof. Her Honour did not do that, but instead only considered whether by itself it pointed to the involvement of MR in the relevant offences. This was the elision committed by the trial judge in Ceissman. It meant that her Honour did not address the ""basis"" of the reasoning put forward by the Crown. It was only at the second stage identified in Zhang that her Honour was required to consider whether the evidence of the events was significantly probative of MR's involvement in the offences. As part of that process her Honour was required to consider the balance of the steps noted in [84] and thus have regard to ""other evidence adduced or to be adduced"" by the Crown (DSJ at [72]). 

87Otherwise her Honour was in error in considering that the evidence indicated that the use of a tomahawk was ""relatively commonplace"". The evidence was all to the contrary.

88After addressing each of the asserted similarities, her Honour then addressed the test of significant probative value in s 98(1)(b) in the passage extracted in [48] above. Three points should be noted. First, while it is not entirely clear, I accept the Crown's submission that her Honour applied a test that required that there be ""striking similarities"" between the various armed robberies. In this passage her Honour noted that there was ""nothing like the striking similarities"" that were present in Ceissman. The reference to ""striking similarities"" in Ceissman was repeated in that part of her Honour's judgment that addressed s 101 of the Evidence Act (see [49]). Her Honour had earlier discussed and addressed whether the various armed robberies had ""striking similarities"" (see [45] to [48]). Counsel for MR, Mr Skinner, pointed out that the phrase ""striking similarities"" was introduced into the discourse by the Crown, and that her Honour was merely adopting the Crown's nomenclature. There is considerable force in that submission. However, I consider that a fair reading of the judgment as a whole reveals that her Honour took that phrase and used it as threshold test. I have explained why it was incorrect to do so (at [77] to [78]). The fact that the Crown may have contributed to this error has already been addressed.

89Second, there is nothing to indicate that her Honour considered the combined effect of all the suggested similarities between the armed robbery offences when assessing whether the evidence had significant probative value (or was even probative). As stated, there was nothing impermissible in considering each of the suggested similarities individually and assessing whether they suggested that the events were coincidental or not. However, for reasons that have already been explained, that does not complete the analysis. All of the similarities must be considered together.

90Third, although it was not the subject of any specific complaint by the Crown, her Honour was clearly in error in stating in the passage noted in [48] that ""there is no evidence directly linking [MR] to one or more of these offences"". As stated, there is very strong evidence directly linking MR to the fourth armed robbery (and the carjacking). If the similarities in the armed robberies were such that a jury could conclude that they were committed by the same group or subgroup of offenders, then, in respect of the first armed robbery, for example, the evidence of those events was, when considered having regard to the evidence directly connecting MR to the fourth armed robbery (and the second and third armed robberies), probative and, in my view, significantly probative of MR's involvement in the first.

91As noted in [49], although the trial judge determined that the evidence did not meet the threshold test in s 98(1)(b), her Honour nevertheless addressed s 101 of the Evidence Act on the assumption that it had significant probative value. Her Honour concluded that, even in that event, the probative value of the evidence sought to be led would not outweigh its prejudicial effect. However the only ""prejudicial effect"" that her Honour referred to was that the jury would conclude ""that [MR] was one of the offenders involved in each of these offences"". If the evidence had been assessed as having significant probative value, then that is the very basis on which it would be admitted, and the use by the jury of the evidence for that purpose would be entirely appropriate. Thus the only prejudice identified by her Honour is that a jury would use evidence tendered for coincidence purposes for coincidence purposes. That would not be a prejudicial use.

92It follows that I accepted all of the Crown's contentions as noted in [80]. Further, each of them raises a basis for reviewing the trial judge's ruling under s 98(1) in that they involve the trial judge either acting on the wrong principle or failing to apply the proper test in a manner which led to a failure to take into account relevant matters, or the taking into account of an irrelevant matter, within the principles stated in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 (see Dao v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 278 ALR 765 at [177] per Simpson J, with whom Schmidt J agreed), or those stated in Shrimpton v Commonwealth [1945] HCA 4; 69 CLR 613 at 620, and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21; 197 CLR 611 at 651 to 654 (see Dao at [100] per Allsop P and at [211] per Kirby J). For those reasons I joined in order 1 noted in [23].

93The remaining issue that arose in relation to the Crown's appeal against the evidentiary ruling is whether the evidence the subject of the coincidence notice (see [41]) should be admitted. Stripped of the element of circularity noted in [42], the similarities between the armed robbery offences included (i) the nature of the target, (ii) the use of a tomahawk and a knife, (iii) the presence of MR's mobile phone in the area of three of the robberies at or around the time they were committed, (iv) the similar clothing worn in each robbery and (v) the similar bags used in some of the robberies. Having reviewed photographs taken from the CCTV footage, it is evident that there are physical similarities in height and weight concerning each of the offenders although they are far from determinative. 

94Further, the evidence relied on was capable of establishing other similarities, being the involvement of K in three of the four armed robberies and N and Z in two of them (and all of them in the carjacking). Otherwise it is to be remembered that the offences all took place in a short period of time in approximately the same area of Sydney. Applying the first stage of the approach from Zhang, as explained in Ceissman at [16], this evidence is capable of rationally affecting the probability of a fact in issue, namely whether the same group or subgroup of offenders was involved in each offence. The test posed by s 55 is satisfied. 

95The next step is to address s 98(1)(b). Consistent with the opening words of s 98(1), the fact addressed at this point is whether MR was involved in each of the offences (see Ceissman at [15] to [16]). To this point I have passed over the significance of there being a different number of offenders in the armed robberies, being four in the first and fourth, two in the second robbery and three in the third. However, the differing number of offenders is potentially a matter of some significance. All other matters being equal, it is a matter that weighs against the evidence of the events being significantly probative of MR's involvement in each offence. Nevertheless, as noted, each of Zhang (at [139]), Ceissman (at [16]) and most importantly DSJ (at [72]), recognises that the evidence of the events can be considered ""on its own account, or by having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the tendering party"". In this case, the uncertainty in terms of admissibility that arises from the differing number of offenders with the second and third armed robberies dissipates when regard is had to those parts of the evidence which directly connect him to each of those offences, albeit that evidence is of varying strength and leaving aside questions of credibility or reliability. Of course whether the jury would regard that evidence connecting him each offence as overcoming any uncertainty that arises from the differing number of offenders is a different matter. 

96Thus, when regard is had to all of the evidence, the evidence of the related events ""has the capacity to be of importance or of consequence in establishing the fact in issue"" (DSJ at [72]), namely the involvement of MR in each offence. Accordingly I am satisfied that s 98(1)(b) is made out. No basis for rejecting the evidence under s 101 was suggested.

97For this reason I joined in order 2, noted in [23].

The appeal against severing the indictment

98The reasons given by her Honour for severing the indictment are set out in [50] above. It appears that her Honour regarded the decision to sever the counts on the indictment as consequential upon the decision to reject the coincidence evidence. Her Honour was concerned that the jury's consideration of one count would be affected by evidence led on another count. 

99The Crown submitted that her Honour applied an incomplete or wrong test for severance. It contended that the mere fact that evidence is to be led on different counts which is not admissible on all counts does not necessarily justify separate trials. In particular it contended that, before severing an indictment, the Court must consider a range of considerations, being not just the potential prejudice to the accused and whether it can be addressed by a direction to the jury, but also the public interest in the efficient disposition of trials and the avoidance of inconvenience to witnesses (citing R v Oliver (1984) 57 ALR 543; Ceissman at [20] to [21] per Latham J, and KRM v R [2001] HCA 11; 206 CLR 221 at [38] per McHugh J).

100There is considerable force in the Crown's submissions, but it is not necessary to resolve that question to decide the appeal from the severance order. Both before her Honour and in this Court it was conceded on behalf of MR that, should he be unsuccessful in resisting the admission of the coincidence evidence, then his application to sever the indictment would fail. Accordingly, once this Court concluded that her Honour erred in rejecting the coincidence evidence and that it should be admitted, then it followed that the Crown's appeal against the order severing the indictment had to succeed. For those reasons I joined in orders 3 and 4 noted in [23].

		08 November 2013",2013-10-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706007,R v Hassan [2013] NSWSC 2034,"EX TEMPORE Judgment1On 17 April 2012 Mariam Henery Yousif was killed, by being stabbed on a large number of occasions.  The accused, Yassir Hassan, was arrested late on the evening of 17 April 2012, and has been charged with her murder.  
2He has been in custody since that time.  The accused was first arraigned in this Court in April 2013, having been committed for trial by the Burwood Local Court on 6 March 2013.  
3At that arraignment the accused pleaded not guilty, and a trial date was fixed for 21 October 2013, for an estimated period of three weeks.  
4On 29 August 2013, I conducted a directions hearing in the matter, to establish what the real issues were likely to be at trial and the readiness of the matter for trial.  On that day, experienced senior counsel appeared for the accused, and informed the court that, firstly, the matter was ready for trial on 21 October 2013; secondly, that the real dispute was confined to a single issue, namely, one of provocation and, thirdly, that the likely estimate of trial was between two and three weeks.  
5Accordingly, on that day I confirmed the trial date.  
6It appears that on 2 October 2013, Mr Juweinat, a solicitor from Aquila Lawyers, met the accused at the Long Bay Correctional Centre, and he was asked by the accused as to whether he would be in a position to act for him in his upcoming trial.  Of course his capacity to act was dependent upon the grant of Legal Aid being transferred to him.  
7The matter was placed in the arraignments list on 4 October 2013, because the court had been informed that the accused had terminated the instructions of his previous lawyers.  The court was so informed by his previous lawyers.  On that date the arraignments judge, Latham J, directed that the trial was to commence, as it had been fixed, on 21 October 2013.  
8On 8 October 2013, Acquila Lawyers were assigned a grant of Legal Aid, but it was apparently a ""start up"" grant, which makes no provision for counsel.  
9As of 4 October 2013, the solicitors whom the accused had recently instructed had not read the brief, nor had they seen the nature of the case against the accused, nor had they had the opportunity of instructing counsel, or taking any steps to ready the matter for hearing.  
10Subsequently, on 11 October 2013, an application was made to the duty judge, Button J, to vacate the trial.  His Honour indicated that he would not do so, but he did defer the commencement of the trial to 28 October 2013, to enable the application to be renewed before me.  
11This morning, counsel for the accused has made an application for the vacation of the trial date.  Counsel has relied upon the fact that it appears, to his instructing solicitor and to himself, that the proper conduct of the defence of the accused involves the need to make enquiries of a number of factual witnesses, the need to satisfy themselves that the transcript of the electronically recorded interview of the accused, upon which the Crown relies, is an accurate one and, finally, that there is a need for two experts to be retained to provide opinions with respect to certain forensic features of items found at the scene of the killing of the deceased.  
12It is, it needs to be said, unacceptable in this Court for an accused, in circumstances where trial dates have been fixed, and fixed for a substantial period, to make a decision to change their legal representation at a very late stage and expect that the court will automatically accommodate their wishes.  
13There are a number of obvious reasons why this is unacceptable.  The first is it is in the public interest that trials of serious crime take place as promptly as is reasonable, having regard to the availability and resources of the criminal justice system.  In particular, when a trial such as this one is fixed for a hearing, that time is no longer available to be used for other trials awaiting hearing.  If the time allocated is not used, then other accused awaiting trial will be unnecessarily delayed.
14Secondly, it is in the interests of justice generally that trials be held without undue delay.  This court has said on many, many occasions that the quality of justice deteriorates the longer the time between the commission of the alleged offence and the trial of the person charged with that offence.  The memory of witnesses fade, the capacity of an accused to challenge contemporaneous evidence becomes harder, and the accuracy and reliability of the evidence of witnesses of contemporaneous fact is adversely affected.  
15Accordingly, it is not in the interests of justice generally to delay the hearing of trials without good reason.  
16And, thirdly, it is in the particular interests of the accused, who has been in custody since 17 April 2012, who wishes to mount a defence which, if successful, would result in his acquittal of the crime, and his discharge from custody, not to be kept in custody for a moment longer than is necessary.  
17Pre-trial custody is a necessary part of the justice system but it does involve keeping a person in custody, in respect of whom there is a presumption of innocence, and in respect of whom, until the jury returns a verdict of guilty, remains an innocent person.  Accordingly, it is not in the interests of the accused to have his trial delayed a moment longer than is necessary to mount an effective defence.  
18I need to weigh those matters with the interests of justice, in so far as they require an accused to have a proper opportunity of preparing a defence of substance which might reasonably be available in the particular circumstances of this case.  
19Counsel for the accused has properly and fairly indicated that the real need for a period of time longer than one week to be available to the accused to prepare for trial, is the need to obtain a particular grant of Legal Aid to enable experts to be retained, and to obtain their expert opinion.  
20But for that submission, I would not have been prepared to adjourn this case and vacate the trial date at all, because the other matters seem to me to be matters to which attention could be given in the available time.  
21However, I am informed that although an application was promptly made to the Legal Aid authorities for an extension of the grant of Legal Aid, that application has not yet been able to be dealt with and, necessarily, the retainer of the experts depends upon the appropriate grant of Legal Aid.  
22Because of the dynamic nature of the court's calendar the court is able to accommodate this trial by commencing it on 18 November 2013.  That is about a month away.  I am satisfied that a proper balance of all of the matters to which I have paid attention earlier in these remarks can be achieved by vacating the trial commencement date of 28 October 2013, and commencing the trial on 18 November 2013.  
23However, it is important that there is a degree of monitoring of the readiness of the accused and the Crown for trial, so as to ensure that the matter proceeds at that time.  
24In all of the circumstances I am not persuaded to vacate the trial entirely, but I will defer the commencement of it, as I have said, to 18 November 2013.  
25I will make the following formal orders: 
(1)I vacate the commencement date of the trial of 28 October 2013.  
(2)I fix the trial to commence at 10am on 18 November 2013.  
(3)I direct that a s 77 Order issue to ensure that the accused is brought in for trial to commence on 18 November 2013.  
(4)I direct that an interpreter in the North Sudanese language be arranged for the course of the trial.  
(5)I order that the matter be listed at 10.15am on Friday 25 October 2013, for a report back by the solicitor for the accused with respect to progress of the grant of Legal Aid and retainer of appropriate experts.  
(6)I vacate the order made in the Local Court at Burwood on 18 April 2012, which suppressed, until further order, the name of the accused, the deceased, or any one connected with the matter.  
(7)I order that the matter be listed in the court list in future under the accused's full name.

		29 April 2014",2013-10-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706008,Paul Hopwood v Regina [2013] NSWDC 250,"Judgment

1.The appellant, Paul Hopwood, was tried before a Magistrate for an offence of indecent assault. It was alleged that on 9 December 2011 late at night and/ or in the early hours of 10 December 2011, the appellant pushed the complainant, Kathryn Smith against a pole in a nightclub at Bondi and pushed his erect penis against her body.

2.As is so often the case where allegations of such offences are made, the appellant, the complainant and a number of other people had been together for some hours, in the course of which, some of them at least had consumed a considerable amount of alcoholic drinks.

3.What had happened earlier in the night of 9 December was that some 200 people had gathered together at the Suisse Grande Hotel in Bondi for the purpose of an annual dinner and get together of the company which employed all of them. The complainant worked as a manager in this company and the appellant as a manager senior to her, but not normally having any direct responsibility for her performance in the company.

4.Before this night, the complainant and the appellant had associated only for the purposes of employment and there had been clashes between the two of them. Each of them lived in towns that were separated from one another by a considerable distance and neither of them normally associated socially.

5.At the hearing before the learned magistrate, the complainant gave evidence that was supported to a great extent by the evidence of Michael Jackson, another employee of the company and someone who was a friend of the complainant. Additionally, the prosecution relied upon complaint evidence made by the complainant to a superior Mr Michael Roberts. The complaint was made very soon after the events of the night and was supported by an email sent to Mr Roberts within a few days. The appellant did not give evidence before the learned magistrate.

6.When convicting the appellant, the Magistrate gave reasons that were quite short. She accepted the complainant and Mr Jackson as witnesses of truth. On 4 September 2013 I gave leave to the appellant to give oral evidence. He gave this evidence on 10 October 2013. His evidence was the only oral evidence before me and I considered it together with the written evidence of the witnesses who gave evidence before the magistrate.

7.In evaluating the evidence, I bore in mind that I did not see any of the witnesses who had given evidence in the Local Court and that the learned magistrate did not have the benefit of considering the evidence of the appellant. My duty is to form my own judgment of the facts so far as I'm able to do so through, recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called in the lower court (See Charara v the Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244 paragraphs 18-23).

Facts

8.The complainant was 30 years old at the time. On the night when these incidents allegedly occurred, she was wearing a dress that was knee length. She attended the function at the hotel on her own. The appellant, for part of the evening at least, was accompanied by his wife. The dinner concluded about 10pm. The complainant then sought to join a group of people whom she knew, including the appellant. When she joined this group, the appellant turned his back to her, something that she regarded as a slight. She moved away from this group and spoke to a number of other people until eventually she and they decided to go to the Bondi Hotel. She purchased an alcoholic drink and stayed with the rest of the group that included the appellant and his wife, Kevin Nielsen and his wife, Stuart Zell, Michael Jackson and Nathan Eek. After half an hour or so, the complainant, accompanied by Mr and Mrs Nielsen went to a nightclub across the road from the hotel. Gradually the others of the earlier group came across except for the wife of the appellant. The complainant said that she became aware that the appellant was standing on his own and looking at her from about three metres away. This made her feel uncomfortable as he appeared to be looking at her up and down. 

9.She joined some of the others on the dance floor. By this time she had consumed one vodka and soda in the nightclub. Subsequently she consumed two more. It was her evidence that the appellant bought these drinks.

10.The first incident, of which she spoke, occurred when she was dancing in front of Stuart Zell and she felt someone pushing against her bottom with a pelvis. That pushed her forward a little into Mr Zell, who was pushed into the DJ. 

11.Mr Zell, when he gave evidence said nothing of this incident. 

12.Mr Jackson when he gave evidence, described the appellant going up behind the complainant and engaging in ""dirty dancing"", or gyrating with his hips and groin on the bottom of the complainant. 

13.None of the others who were called to give evidence noticed this happening.

14.The next incident involved the appellant physically grabbing the complainant around the waist, putting his face close to her and saying: ""I know you can feel the chemistry between us"". The complainant gave evidence that she shouted loudly and he let her go.

15.None of the others gave evidence about this incident.

16.The third incident involved the appellant pulling the complainant into a pole and forcing one of his legs between her legs so that she could feel his penis against her leg. Mr Jackson saw the appellant holding the complainant's arm against the pole and leaning forward as if to kiss her. The other persons who gave evidence did not speak of this incident.

17.On 14 December, she contacted Michael Roberts, who supervises her and complained of being sexually harassed by the appellant and followed this up by sending him an email with details of her complaint.

18.The appellant when he gave evidence before me denied these incidents. He also gave evidence that he had, on a number of occasions before the night of the incidents, reprimanded her about her performance at work.

Submissions

19.Submissions were put to me on behalf of the appellant that the incidents did not occur, being invented by the complainant because of her sense of grievance at reprimands that the appellant had given to her on occasions before the night of the dinner arising from her performance as an employee.

20.I am satisfied, having looked at the evidence of Mr Roberts and considering the evidence of the appellant that he did cause some reproofs or reprimands to be given to the complainant at some time before this day. Counsel also put that his client had given evidence before me in an honest and straightforward manner and his evidence raised a doubt about the case against him.

21.The prosecution submitted that I should confirm the finding of guilt made by the learned magistrate, particularly since she had made findings accepting the credibility of the complainant and Mr Jackson.

Consideration of the facts and of the submissions

22.There is no doubt in my mind that the night club was dark, noisy and crowded and the fact that people bumped into one another could have been expected to have occurred without anyone taking any particular notice. Similarly, the way in which various persons reacted with others was easily likely to have not been noticed.

23.The fact that no one, apart from the complainant and Mr Jackson did not witness the incident in which the appellant placed his groin against the bottom of the complainant and pushed forward, does not surprise me, just as it does not surprise me that Mr Zell did not recollect such an incident.

24.I have not seen the complainant give evidence, but like the learned magistrate, my reading of her evidence convinced me that she was a credible witness. Her evidence has a ring of truth, just as the evidence of Mr Jackson has a ring of truth. Unlike the other witnesses who gave evidence of what occurred on this evening, Mr Jackson did not consume any alcohol at the nightclub and therefore, must have been much less affected by alcohol than any of the other witnesses.

25.I considered carefully the submissions about the complainant's possible motivation to invent these incidents. However, I am not convinced that she had any motive at all to make any false complaint. 

26.She gave evidence, which I accept, that she accompanied the other witnesses, including the appellant to this nightclub after she had been with them in a group at another hotel. Her motivation in going to the nightclub was to engage in dancing. She accepted alcoholic drinks at the nightclub and it stretches credibility to suggest that she went to the nightclub, consumed alcoholic drinks and danced all as part of an elaborate plot to implicate the appellant in a crime that he did not commit.

27.She also has a friendship with Mr Jackson and the submissions made as to her motivation must necessarily include a claim that he was part of this plot to implicate the appellant.

28.I do not accept that this is so. The descriptions given by the complainant of each of the assaults on her in the nightclub are detailed and believable. They are supported by the observations of Mr Jackson. I pay due regard to the findings made by the learned magistrate and I want to say clearly that separately I have exactly the same view as she does, as to the credibility of these two witnesses.

29.Her complaint to Mr Roberts was, in terms of section 66 of the Evidence Act 1995, fresh in her memory and accordingly, I am entitled to take it into account as evidence supporting the crime alleged against the appellant. There is no basis in my opinion for limiting the use that can be made of the complaint, nor is there any relevant reason to exclude it for unfairness.

Decision

30.In my opinion, the learned magistrate was correct to find the offence proved and I dismiss the appeal. There is no appeal against sentence and I confirm the conviction and sentence.

		26 February 2014",2013-10-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706018,Tonari v R [2013] NSWCCA 232,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: The Appellant, Nobutomo Tonari, appeals against his conviction by a jury in the District Court on 27 August 2012 with respect to five counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent under s.61J(1) Crimes Act 1900 and two counts of indecent assault under s.61L of that Act.

Hearing of Conviction Appeal Before Sentence is Passed

2In the unusual circumstances to be considered shortly, the Appellant has not yet been sentenced for these offences. The presiding Judge adjourned the sentencing proceedings to allow an appeal against conviction to proceed to this Court. The Appellant was granted conditional bail in the District Court in the meantime. 

3It was common ground between the parties that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal against conviction notwithstanding that the Appellant has not been sentenced: Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293 at 301-302, 313, 334; R v MAJW [2007] NSWCCA 145; 171 A Crim R 407 at 411 [14]-[15]. 

4There was discussion before the trial Judge as to whether the mechanism under s.5A Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be utilised. The Appellant has proceeded with an appeal against conviction under s.5 of that Act. This approach has been adopted in this Court on a prior occasion: Boujaoude v R [2008] NSWCCA 35; 72 NSWLR 85 at 87 [3]-[5]. 

5The fact that the Court has proceeded to hear and determine the present appeal should not serve as any encouragement to adopt this procedure in other cases. The ordinary and appropriate course, where s.5 is relied upon, is to avoid fragmentation of the criminal trial and appellate process and for the primary court to proceed to sentence the convicted person, with any appeal against conviction, or conviction and sentence, proceeding thereafter in the usual way.

6In the event that the appeal against conviction is dismissed, it is accepted that this Court should remit the proceedings to the District Court under s.12(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 so that the Appellant may be sentenced. 

The Indictment

7Counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 in the indictment each charged the Appellant with an offence under s.61J(1) in the following terms:

""On 12 May 2011 at Chatswood in the State of New South Wales, [the Appellant] did have sexual intercourse with [the Complainant] without her consent, knowing she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation, namely at the time of the commission of the offence the [Appellant] threatened to inflict actual bodily harm upon [the Complainant].""

8Counts 2 and 6 charged the Appellant with offences under s.61L in the following terms:

""On 12 May 2011 at Chatswood in the State of New South Wales, [the Appellant] did assault [the Complainant] and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency on the said [Complainant]"".

An Issue Arises Concerning the Indictment After Verdict

9After the Appellant pleaded not guilty to each count on 6 August 2012, the trial proceeded until verdicts of guilty were returned by the jury on all counts on 27 August 2012. 

10At the beginning of the sentence proceedings on 9 November 2012, the Crown Prosecutor informed the Court that a defect in the indictment had been detected. To bring the counts into line with s.61J(2)(b), application was made to amend the indictment by inserting the words ""by means of an offensive instrument"" at the end of each of the s.61J(1) counts. The trial Judge refused the application and the proceedings were adjourned until 22 November 2012.

11On 22 November 2012, the Crown made a further application to amend the indictment by deleting any reference to the circumstance of aggravation in the s.61J(1) counts, which would have had the effect of converting the charges to counts of sexual intercourse without consent under s.61I Crimes Act 1900. On 11 December 2012, the trial Judge refused leave to amend the indictment in this respect.

12No point had been raised concerning the form of the indictment prior to or during the trial. The appeal was conducted in this Court upon the basis that the difficulty with the s.61J(1) counts was not picked up until the Crown detected it after the jury had convicted the Appellant.

13Upon the basis that the Appellant would prosecute a conviction appeal in this Court expeditiously, the trial Judge adjourned the sentencing proceedings and granted the Appellant conditional bail. 

Grounds of Appeal

14With the leave of the Court, the Appellant relied upon the following grounds of appeal at the hearing on 29 July 2013:

(a) Ground 1 - The trial is a nullity because the indictment alleges offences which are not known to the law.

(b) Ground 2 - The convictions in relation to Counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 should be quashed because those counts allege offences which are not known to the law.

(c) Ground 2A - As a result of the defect in the indictment, the learned trial Judge misdirected the jury as to the elements of the offences by failing to direct the jury that conviction on Counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 required proof beyond reasonable doubt that the relevant threat was ""by means of an offensive weapon or instrument"" and by failing to explain those terms and concepts to the jury.

(d) Ground 3 - The trial miscarried due to the prejudice occasioned by the introduction into the trial of circumstances of aggravation that are not known to the law.

(e) Ground 4 - The trial Judge erred in directions to the jury in relation to the proper approach to multiple counts and multiple allegations.

(f) Ground 5 - The trial Judge erred in his directions as to the relevance of the Appellant's good character.

(g) Ground 6 - The verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.

A Brief Summary of the Crown and Defence Cases at Trial

15To place the grounds of appeal in context, it is appropriate to set out briefly the nature of the Crown and defence cases at trial. More will be said in this respect when considering the sixth ground of appeal. 

16The Appellant and the Complainant are both Japanese citizens. In May 2011, the Appellant was aged 28 years and the Complainant was 29 years' old. The Complainant came to Australia in early 2011 on a working holiday. The Appellant had been in Australia for about a month at the time of the relevant events in May 2011. 

17The Appellant and the Complainant first met through a support agency for Japanese people in Sydney at the beginning of May 2011. They met again on two separate occasions and, on the second occasion, they exchanged telephone numbers.

18On 11 May 2011, the Appellant met the Complainant at the Chatswood Westfield shopping centre. They walked back to the Complainant's unit at Chatswood after purchasing groceries together. The Appellant offered to cook dinner.

The Complainant's Account

19The Complainant said that the Appellant sat on the sofa next to the Complainant with his arm around her and that she moved away to sit on the opposite side of the sofa. The two then talked until late at night. 

20At a later hour, the Appellant asked if he could stay over. The Complainant refused. The Appellant left briefly, but returned to ask to stay again. Reluctantly, the Complainant agreed that he could sleep on the sofa. She slept in her bedroom.

21During the course of the night, the Complainant woke and found the Appellant straddling her in bed, threatening to hit her in the face if she screamed and accusing her of stealing money from him. He placed his hand on her neck at one stage. He then forced his penis into the Complainant's mouth (Count 1) and licked her breasts (Count 2). The Appellant inserted his fingers into the Complainant's vagina (Count 3), while putting his penis back in her mouth (Count 4). The Appellant then removed his fingers and placed his penis inside her vagina (Count 5). After removing his penis, he dribbled a string of saliva into her mouth and forced her to swallow (Count 6). The Appellant then put his penis back in the Complainant's mouth and ejaculated into her mouth and on her chin and hair (Count 7).

22The Appellant then remained in the bed with the Complainant, until around 6.00 am, when she asked to go to the bathroom. She noticed blood coming from her vagina and thought about running from the unit, but did not do so as she felt the Appellant may prevent her from doing so. The Complainant returned to the bed. The Appellant later accused the Complainant again of having stolen money from him.

23The Appellant finally left the unit. The Complainant, in a distressed state, immediately called her mother in Japan, saying that she had been raped. The Complainant also called a friend, Miwako Hishi, whose husband informed the police.

24Medical examination of the Complainant revealed bruises to her neck and signs of vaginal trauma, which the medical practitioner testified were consistent with the Complainant's account of sexual assault.
 
The Appellant's Account

25The defence case was that the Appellant and the Complainant had sexual intercourse, but that the acts were consensual. The Appellant denied the event alleged to have constituted Count 6.

26The Appellant gave evidence that the Complainant accepted his offer to make dinner at her place. After dinner, the Appellant gave the Complainant a consensual massage after she complained of having stiff shoulders and gave her a kiss on the cheek.

27According to the Appellant, a conversation took place between them until 2.00 am, concerning the Appellant's family and the wealthy estate he inherited after his grandfather's death. 

28The Appellant left the Complainant's home in the middle of the night, but was unable to catch a bus home. He returned and the Complainant was happy for him to stay.

29According to the Appellant, the Complainant sat next to him on the sofa and he massaged her again. 

30According to the Appellant, they then had consensual vaginal and oral sex, after which the Appellant removed his penis from the Complainant's vagina and asked where he should ejaculate. The Complainant said, ""In my mouth"" and the Appellant did so.

31The Appellant fell asleep and was woken by the sound of the Complainant flushing the toilet. He went to the bathroom and, on his way back to the bedroom, he noticed that his wallet had been moved. He asked the Complainant why she would steal money ($50.00) from him and she proceeded to look around the apartment for money. The Appellant said he would report the matter to the police if she did not admit to stealing. 

32The Appellant left the Complainant's residence and did not contact her again.

33The Appellant was arrested by police on 15 June 2011. He took part in an electronically recorded interview in which he admitted sexual activity with the Complainant, but asserted that it was consensual.

Grounds 1, 2, 2A and 3 - Grounds Based Upon the Wording of the s.61J Counts in the Indictment

34The provisions in s.61J(1) and (2)(a)-(b) are relevant to these grounds of appeal. They provide:

""61J Aggravated sexual assault

(1) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.

(2) In this section, circumstances of aggravation means circumstances in which:

(a) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender intentionally or recklessly inflicts actual bodily harm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby, or

(b) at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of the offence, the alleged offender threatens to inflict actual bodily harm on the alleged victim or any other person who is present or nearby by means of an offensive weapon or instrument, or 

...""

35The circumstances of aggravation relevant to this case are those contained in s.61J(2)(b), which require that any threat to inflict actual bodily harm be ""by means of an offensive weapon or instrument"". 

36The term ""offensive weapon or instrument"" is defined in s.4(1) Crimes Act 1900 in the following way:

""Offensive weapon or instrument means:

(a) a dangerous weapon, or

(b) any thing that is made or adapted for offensive purposes, or

(c) any thing that, in the circumstances, is used, intended for use or threatened to be used for offensive purposes, whether or not it is ordinarily used for offensive purposes or is capable of causing harm.""

37It is the fact that neither the Crown Prosecutor nor defence counsel addressed the jury during the trial by reference to any threat being ""by means of an offensive weapon or instrument"". Nor did the trial Judge direct the jury on this issue. It appears that the trial proceeded without either counsel or the trial Judge detecting the missing words in the s.61J(1) counts. 

38The Complainant did give evidence of verbal threats made to her by the Appellant, including a threat to use an item (which she could not see in the dark bedroom) to harm her. The Complainant testified that the Appellant had said it was a key, but she did not see it. 

39The trial was conducted upon the basis that the jury was informed, in the Crown opening and thereafter, of the availability of alternative verdicts of guilty under s.61I, in the event that the jury was not satisfied to the requisite standard that the circumstances of aggravation had been established for Counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7: s.61Q(1) Crimes Act 1900.
 
40The offence under s.61I is in the following terms:

""61I Sexual assault

Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.""

41The Crown application of 9 November 2012 was to amend the s.61J(1) counts under s.20 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 by inserting the words ""by means of an offensive instrument"". The trial Judge refused the application.

42The further Crown application on 22 November 2012 was made under s.21 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and sought to amend the indictment so as to allege offences under s.61I in place of those under s.61J. The application was based upon the proposition that the verdicts of the jury clearly demonstrated satisfaction to the criminal standard that the Appellant was guilty of five counts under s.61I, with such a conclusion not being affected by the missing words in the s.61J(1) counts. The trial Judge refused this amendment application on 11 December 2012.

43The grounds of appeal presently under consideration do not involve any alleged defect in the s.61L counts of indecent assault. However, it is submitted for the Appellant that those convictions ought be quashed by reference to other grounds of appeal. 

The Appellant's Submissions

44Mr Hamill SC, for the Appellant, submitted that the convictions of the Appellant on Counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 involved offences not known to law so that the trial was a nullity. He submitted that this was not a case of an imperfect formulation of a known offence, but the allegation of an offence not known to the law: Doja v R [2009] NSWCCA 303; 198 A Crim R 349 at 355 [22]. 

45It was submitted for the Appellant that the jury in this case was not called upon to consider the circumstances of aggravation created by s.61J, with the Crown putting to the jury a circumstance of aggravation (a threat to inflict actual bodily harm) which is not contemplated by the statute. In these circumstances, it was submitted that it could not be suggested that the defect in the indictment was cured by the verdicts. 

46Mr Hamill SC submitted that a conviction based on a defective indictment might be valid, but only where there has been no miscarriage of justice, for example, where the defect is merely technical: Mackay v The Queen [1977] HCA 22; 136 CLR 465. He submitted, however, that even defects of a highly technical nature can render an indictment invalid and a trial a nullity, referring in this respect to R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; 64 NSWLR 10. In the absence of a valid indictment, it was submitted that the jurisdiction of the Court was not invoked: R v Janceski at 22 [54], 40 [205]. 

47Mr Hamill SC submitted that the defect in the present indictment is to be distinguished from a case where the invalidity or defect is to be found in the particulars of the offence, such as Boujaoude v R.

48The submissions referred to so far were made in support of the first and second grounds of appeal. 

49To the extent that the Crown contended that there could be a valid conviction for the statutory alternative under s.61I of the Act, it was submitted that there is a distinction between cases where the indictment contained mere surplusage (R v Smith and Kirton (1990) 47 A Crim R 43) and the present case where, it was contended, there were no valid s.61J charges laid in the first place. As the District Court's jurisdiction had not been invoked, it was submitted that there could be no valid conviction for s.61I offences or on the other counts alleging indecent assault. 

50In support of Ground 3, it was submitted that the introduction of circumstances of aggravation that were not known to law unfairly prejudiced the Appellant in a manner which gave rise to a miscarriage of justice: R v Ayres [1984] 1 AC 447 at 460-461. 

51Ground 2A, added by leave at the hearing before this Court, is based upon an alternative submission that the defect in the indictment led to the jury being misdirected concerning the elements of the s.61J offences, so that the convictions on those counts ought, in any event, be quashed. 

Submissions of the Crown

52The Crown submitted that the indictment was not a nullity with the charges being, in truth, imperfect formulations of known offences under s.61J. 

53The Crown submitted that the indictment was incomplete, rather than defective, in light of the manner in which the circumstances of aggravation were charged.

54The Crown contended that the absent words concerning an offensive weapon or instrument could be ""necessarily implied"" for the purpose of s.16(1)(b) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. In circumstances where the Complainant had given evidence that she had been threatened, including threats made by means of what she was later told was a key, it was submitted that this was a feature of the trial, although the indictment did not contain this express averment, and trial counsel did not address the issue, nor did the trial Judge direct the jury on this aspect. 

55Even if s.16(1)(b) did not apply, the Crown submitted that the paragraphs contained in s.16(1) are not exhaustive of the circumstances in which an imperfect indictment may nonetheless be valid: R v Janceski at 26 [79].

56The Crown contended that, the indictment not being a nullity, the proviso contained in s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 could be used to affirm the convictions on the s.61J counts. Reliance was placed in this regard upon Chanthaboury v R [2007] NSWCCA 290; 176 A Crim R 438. 

57The Crown acknowledged that, in the circumstances of the trial, the jury had not been directed properly on the elements of the s.61J counts, so that the convictions on those counts could not stand (Ground 2A). 

58In light of the meritorious Ground 2A, a submission was not pressed by the Crown that the verdicts of the jury cured any defects in the s.61J counts.

59The Crown submitted, however, that an appropriate course for this Court would be to utilise s.7(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and convict the Appellant of the statutory alternatives under s.61I Crimes Act 1900 on each of the five s.61J counts. 

60It was submitted that the error in the indictment did not in any way prejudice or embarrass the Appellant. The real issue in the trial was the issue of consent. The indictment, as pleaded, contained particulars of offences under s.61I, and the verdicts of the jury were such that this Court can be satisfied that the Appellant had been found guilty by the jury of offences of having sexual intercourse without consent, as lesser alternative counts contained within the parameters of the s.61J counts. That offence is an essential component in the proof of the s.61J offence, and it was a necessary step towards establishing the major offence that the commission of the lesser offence be proven: R v MAJW at 413 [25].

61The Crown pointed to the fact that the jury asked a question during their deliberations concerning the circumstances of aggravation, and that it may be inferred readily that, by that time, the jury was satisfied to the requisite standard that the Appellant was guilty of sexual intercourse without consent, knowing that the Complainant was not consenting, so as to render him liable to conviction on s.61I offences. 

62The Crown submitted that this Court should then remit the matter to the District Court so that the Appellant may be sentenced for the s.61I offences and the s.61L offences, for which he had been convicted by the jury.

Decision

63If the Crown had sought to amend the indictment at any time prior to the return of verdicts by the jury, ss.20-21 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 would have been called into play. Those sections state relevantly:

""20 Amendment of indictment

(1) An indictment may not be amended after it is presented, except by the prosecutor:

(a) with the leave of the court, or

(b) with the consent of the accused.

(2) This section does not affect the powers of the court under section 21.

(3) For the purposes of this section, an amendment of an indictment includes the substitution of an indictment.

21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial

(1) If of the opinion that an indictment is defective but, having regard to the merits of the case, can be amended without injustice, the court may make such order for the amendment of the indictment as it thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case.

... 

(6) Any power of the court under this section is in addition to and not in derogation of any other power of the court for the same or similar purposes.""

64It was ss.20 and 21 which were sought to be utilised by the Crown in an effort to amend the indictment in the course of the sentencing proceedings. In Rajendran v R [2010] NSWCCA 322; 206 A Crim R 316 at 323-325 [35]-[49], Simpson J (Blanch and Garling JJ agreeing) considered the purpose and operation of ss.20 and 21. Her Honour observed that s.20 confers power to amend an indictment, with a typical example being to amend the date of the alleged offence. Section 21, on the other hand, is ""more complex"", with its underpinning being an opinion by the Court that an indictment is defective. 

65No challenge is made in this Court to the decisions of the trial Judge in declining to make either of the orders sought by the Crown on 9 and 22 November 2012 and 11 December 2012, after verdicts had been returned. This Court has indicated (without deciding) that s.21 is unlikely to be available to amend an indictment after a jury has returned its verdict: R v MAJW at 413-414 [29]-[39].

Was the Indictment a Nullity?

66Section 11 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that the description of any offence in the words of an Act or statutory rule or other document creating the offence, or in similar words, is sufficient in law. 

67Section 16(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides (relevantly) for certain defects to not affect an indictment:

""16 Certain defects do not affect indictment

(1) An indictment is not bad, insufficient, void, erroneous or defective on any of the following grounds:

(a) for the improper insertion or omission of the words 'as appears by the record', 'with force and arms', 'against the peace', 'against the form of the statute' or 'feloniously',

(b) for want of an averment of any matter unnecessary to be proved or necessarily implied,

(c) for want of a proper or perfect venue or a proper or formal conclusion,

(d) for want of any additional accused person or for any imperfection relating to any additional accused person,

(e) for want of any statement of the value or price of any matter or thing, or the amount of damage or injury, if such value, price or amount is not of the essence of the offence,

(f) for designating any person by the name of his or her office, or other descriptive appellation, instead of by his or her proper name,

(g) except where time is an essential ingredient, for omitting to state the time at which an offence was committed, for stating the time wrongly or for stating the time imperfectly,

(h) for stating an offence to have been committed on a day subsequent to the finding of the indictment, on an impossible day or on a day that never happened,

(i) if the indictment was signed by an Australian legal practitioner who has been instructed to prosecute the proceedings to which the indictment relates on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions - for failure by the Director to authorise the Australian legal practitioner by order in writing under section 126 (2) to sign indictments for and on behalf of the Director.

... .""

68Section 17 provides:

""17 When formal objections to be taken

(1) An objection to an indictment for a formal defect apparent on its face must be taken, by demurrer or motion to quash the indictment, before the jury is sworn.

(2) The court before which the objection is taken may cause the indictment to be amended and, in that case, the trial is to proceed as if there had been no defect.

69In R v Janceksi, Spigelman CJ observed (at 26 [79]) that the scope of ss.16 and 17 was so wide that it could not be said that every other defect not mentioned in those provisions, however or whenever occurring, should deprive an indictment of its character.

70This is not a case such as R v Janceski, where the indictment was not signed by an authorised person (s.16(1)(i) was enacted to meet this problem), or R v Swansson [2007] NSWCCA 67; 69 NSWLR 406, where two indictments were relied upon before a jury in clear breach of the ""one indictment, one jury"" rule. In those cases, there were fundamental failures in the trial process which went to the validity of the proceedings. Although there were differing views in R v Swansson as to whether the conviction was a nullity, there was clear acceptance that the proceedings were fatally flawed in law, so that there could be no recourse to the proviso under s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

71The true problem in the present case is that there was an incomplete statement of the statutory circumstance of aggravation relied upon under s.61J. Although the s.61J counts alleged as an element that the offences were committed ""in circumstances of aggravation"", the counts did not set out the complete formula of words contained in s.61J(2)(b).

72It may be said that each of the s.61J counts alleged a s.61J(1) offence, but each was imperfect in that the complete s.61J(2) formula was not used.

73The requirements for a valid indictment have been considered in a number of cases, to which reference will shortly be made.

74The terms of a charge contained in an indictment need not set out, in an exhaustive way, all features of the charge alleged against an accused person. For example, the s.61J(1) charges against the Appellant alleged that he had ""sexual intercourse"" with the Complainant on five occasions. The definition of ""sexual intercourse"" in s.61H Crimes Act 1900 extends to a variety of acts. It has not been contended here, or in any other case to my knowledge, that an indictment for a s.61I offence or a s.61J(1) offence must spell out the form of sexual intercourse which is alleged to have taken place. McClellan CJ at CL (Sully J agreeing) made this very point in Lodhi v R [2006] NSWCCA 121; 199 FLR 303 at 327 [107]. Identification of the form of ""sexual intercourse"" alleged is regarded as a matter of particulars to be communicated in a manner external to the indictment.

75Likewise, the s.61J(1) charges against the Appellant allege that he had sexual intercourse with the Complainant ""without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting"". The concepts of knowledge about consent and negation of consent are explained in s.61HA Crimes Act 1900. No complaint is made here, nor in any other proceedings to my knowledge, that an indictment for a s.61J(1) offence or s.61I offence must identify the manner in which these consent issues are said to apply in a particular case. 

76During the course of the hearing in this Court, Mr Hamill SC was asked why the indictment was not sufficient as it asserted that the alleged s.61J(1) offences were committed ""in circumstances of aggravation"". Senior counsel responded that, for the indictment to be valid, it was necessary that the circumstances of aggravation be expressly set out. He submitted that this obligation arose because the circumstances of aggravation were contained in s.61J(2), the section which provides for the s.61J offence itself. He submitted that it was not necessary to identify the form of sexual intercourse involved because that concept arose in a different section (s.61H) and not the offence section itself.

77It is difficult to see why this distinction would matter. The offence is contained in s.61J(1). The elements of the offence are further explained in other provisions, including s.61H, s.61HA and s.61J(2). 

78To my mind, each of these matters involve particulars, and not a statement of the offence which must be set out in full in the indictment.

79However, the s.61J(1) counts went further, alleging the incomplete circumstances of aggravation ""namely at the time of the commission of the offence the said Nobutomo Tonari threatened to inflict actual bodily harm upon [the Complainant]"".

80To the extent that the absence of words may be said to constitute a defect, s.16 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 may be called in aid in an appropriate case. For example, s.16(1)(b) operates where there is a failure to aver a matter which is necessarily implied. 

81Whether the particular matter may be necessarily implied will involve consideration of the conduct of the trial itself. It is at this point that there are difficulties for the Crown in this case. The trial was conducted without any reference to the offensive instrument issue, and the jury was not directed in accordance with the complete statutory formula of the circumstance of aggravation as contained in s.61J(2) of the Act. 

82This is not a case where the trial was conducted by prosecution, defence and the trial Judge upon the basis that the offensive instrument aspect was to be proved, but with the words being omitted from the indictment. Rather, the trial was conducted upon the basis that the s.61J(1) charges as contained in the indictment correctly reflected the matters to be proved. This aspect has particular significance with respect to Ground 2A. 

83It is difficult to see how necessary implication under s.16(1)(b) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 can operate to assist the Crown in these circumstances: Doja v R at 356-357 [32]-[36].

84Even if the view be formed that the s.61J(1) counts in this case were deficient because of the failure to specify fully the relevant circumstances of aggravation, I am satisfied that this would constitute a mere defect and not a matter rendering those counts (or the indictment) a nullity. 

85The distinction between a mere defect and a fundamental failure (rendering the indictment a nullity), referred to by Lord Bridge of Harwich in R v Ayres at 460-461, has been adopted and applied in a number of decisions in Australia. 

86In Kahatapitiye v R [2004] WASCA 189; 146 A Crim R 542, the failure to include the words ""without her consent"" in sexual assault counts was held not to render the indictment a nullity. After referring to R v Ayres, Templeman J (Wheeler and Miller JJ agreeing) concluded (at 545 [22]-[23]) that it was intended to charge ""a known and subsisting criminal offence; that is to say, the offence of sexual penetration without consent, which was pleaded in the indictment in terms which were incomplete or otherwise imperfect"". The proviso could be applied in those circumstances.

87The decisions in R v Ayres and Kahatapitiye v R were referred to by this Court in Chanthaboury v R, where it was accepted that the relevant Court Attendance Notice contained an error, in that it described an offence of accessory after the fact to robbery, and not attempted robbery. McClellan CJ at CL (Barr and Bergin JJ agreeing) referred, without criticism, to the distinction between nullity and mere defect in R v Ayres, and the application of this principle in Kahatapitiye v R.

88In Boujaoude v R, the indictment alleged an offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (heroin), but the quantity specified fell far below the commercial quantity for that drug. Giles JA (Hislop and Price JJ agreeing), at 92-95 [38]-[49], applied R v Ayres and Kahatapitiye v R. The indictment was held to be valid, ""although defectively particularised"" (at 94 [45]).

89In Doja v R, the appellant was convicted of several offences under s.178BB Crimes Act 1900, two of which failed to allege the relevant mental element, in that they did not include any reference to the ""knowledge"" of the appellant or his alleged ""reckless disregard"" of the truth of the statement made. McClellan CJ at CL (Grove J agreeing), observed (at 365-366 [104]-[105]) that the omissions were plainly an oversight which were not appreciated by the Judge or counsel at trial. 

90The Chief Judge at Common Law concluded (at 372 [130]) that the indictment in that case was not invalid or the proceedings a nullity. The indictment could have been amended during the course of the trial. His Honour held that the verdicts cured the defects in the indictment. In any event, his Honour held (at 372-375 [131]-[144]), referring to R v Ayres and Kahatapitiye v R, that the proviso could be applied in that case.

91McClellan CJ at CL (Grove J agreeing) said at 377-378 [158]-[159]:

""[158] The 19th century cases which defined the common law response to a defective indictment were decided before the contemporary statutory procedures for the laying of criminal charges and the conduct of criminal trials were enacted. However, the policy evident in the statutory regime is consistent with the common law position. Where the defect deprives the court of jurisdiction a conviction cannot save the indictment and the conviction must be quashed. So much is plain if the indictment was not signed by an authorised person or alleged an offence unknown to the law. However, provided the court has jurisdiction and it may be concluded that the jury has been properly instructed as to the elements of the relevant offence, and the accused has not been prejudiced in his trial a conviction for that offence will not be disturbed.

[159] In my opinion, although defective with respect to counts 13 and 14, the indictment in the present case was not itself invalid so as to deprive the District Court entirely of jurisdiction. The considerations which led to the quashing of the conviction in Janceski are not relevant in the present case. If objection had been taken at the trial the problem could have been dealt with by amendment of the indictment which would have been granted pursuant to s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act.""

92In Park v R [2010] NSWCCA 151; 202 A Crim R 133, McClellan CJ at CL (James J agreeing) accepted (at 142 [41]) in the context of a complaint concerning a charge of attempted murder, that at worst, there had been an imperfect formulation of a known offence - it would be ""imperfect rather than defective"". Even if his Honour had concluded that the indictment was defective, it was not one which deprived the Court of jurisdiction (at 143 [48]).

93In Area Concrete Pumping Pty Limited v Inspector Childs [2012] NSWCA 208; 232 IR 86, Bathurst CJ (Basten JA, in separate reasons, and Hoeben JA agreeing), at 103 [49], applied R v Boujaoude in stating that ""even an inadequately described offence will not necessarily render the offence unknown to law such that jurisdiction is lost and amendment provisions cannot operate"".

94I return to the circumstances of this appeal.

95In my view, the indictment charged s.61J(1) offences which were known to the law. The wording was incomplete in its description of the circumstances of aggravation under s.61J(2). This was an imperfect formulation of a known offence. The District Court had jurisdiction to proceed with the trial. Had application been made in the course of the trial, it would have been open to the trial Judge, subject to discretionary considerations, to allow an amendment. That did not happen. Had the trial been conducted upon the basis that the threat to inflict actual bodily harm had been by means of an offensive instrument (although the indictment did not so allege), then it would be open to this Court to conclude that the imperfection or defect in the indictment was cured by the verdicts.

96Further, in circumstances where it has not been established that the trial was a nullity, it would have been open to the jury to find the Appellant guilty of the alternative offences under s.61I at trial. 

Addressing the Grounds of Appeal

97By reference to the first and second grounds of appeal, I am not persuaded that the indictment alleged s.61J offences which were ""not known to the law"". The statement of the charges was, in my view, sufficient to render them lawful. Accordingly, it has not been established that the trial was a nullity because of the inclusion of these charges in the indictment. The first ground of appeal should be rejected. 

98The second ground of appeal should fail upon the basis that the convictions with respect to Counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 did not arise with respect to alleged offences which are not known to the law. 

99However, Ground 2A addresses the real difficulty which arose in this trial. In the circumstances, the jury was not directed as to the elements of the relevant circumstance of aggravation, nor were any directions given which sought to relate that direction of law with the factual issues in the trial. This is sufficient, in my view, to warrant the quashing of the convictions on the s.61J(1) charges. 

100With respect to the third ground of appeal, I am not persuaded that the introduction of the concept of circumstances of aggravation into the trial caused the trial to miscarry due to prejudice to the Appellant. What the Crown relied upon, being the verbal threats and the use of force, was all admissible whether the charge was laid under s.61J or s.61I of the Act. It was relevant to the critical issue in the trial - consent. The references in the s.61J counts to circumstances of aggravation, and the submissions of counsel and directions to the jury, did not serve to distract or deflect the jury. Certainly, no unfairness has been demonstrated by the Appellant.

101In my view, the Appellant has failed to make good the third ground of appeal. It has not been established that the trial miscarried due to prejudice occasioned to the Appellant by the introduction into the trial of circumstances of aggravation in the manner which occurred in this case.

102The true error in this case is that identified in Ground 2A. The jury was given incomplete directions of law concerning the legal concept of a circumstance of aggravation, and were not directed in a manner which would otherwise have been required concerning the factual application of that legal direction to this case. 

103However, it is tolerably clear, in my view, that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty of each of the five counts of having sexual intercourse without consent with the Complainant, so as to render him liable to conviction under s.61I in each case. So much is clear from the fact that, after extended deliberation, the final question asked by the jury sought clarification on the issue on the circumstances of aggravation. It may be inferred readily that the jury was otherwise satisfied of the elements of each offence to that point. 

104Subject to the determination of other grounds of appeal, it will be necessary for the Court to consider the application of s.7(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to substitute convictions under s.61I for those under s.61J(1) of the Act.

105I would reject Grounds 1, 2 and 3 but would uphold Ground 2A.

Ground 4 - The Trial Judge Erred in Directing the Jury in Relation to the Proper Approach to Multiple Counts and Multiple Allegations

Submissions of the Parties

106Mr Hamill SC submitted that the directions given by the trial Judge did not comply with the principles in R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; 52 NSWLR 82 (""Markuleski""). In the circumstances of this trial, where he submitted the Crown case depended substantially, if not entirely, upon the evidence of the Complainant, more needed to be said to the jury with respect to the reasoning process to be followed where there were several counts contained in the indictment.

107It was submitted that the jury's attention was not expressly directed to the proposition that a reasonable doubt in relation to the Complainant's credibility in respect of one count, should or ought be taken into account on the Complainant's credibility generally. As a result, it was submitted that the jury had not been directed on this crucial matter, so that a legitimate process of reasoning was effectively denied to the jury, thereby causing the trial to miscarry.

108Mr Hamill SC argued, as well, that the failure of the indictment to allege the complete circumstance of aggravation in the s.61J counts, by reference to an offensive instrument, served to fortify the Appellant's arguments in support of this ground. It was submitted that the Appellant's arguments pointing to discrepancies in the evidence of the Complainant, by reference to a suggested item (a key), would have acquired greater prominence in the minds of the jury if the indictment had charged that aspect properly as an element of the offence.

109The Crown traced the directions given by the trial Judge following submissions made at trial by the Crown and defence counsel, and submitted that the jury would have clearly understood that, if it had a reasonable doubt about the Complainant's credibility in relation to one count, it would be difficult to see how the evidence of the Complainant could be accepted in relation to other counts. 

110The Crown emphasised that there was no fixed wording for a direction in this area, with the precise terminology remaining a matter for the trial Judge in all the circumstances of the particular case: Markuleski at 122 [191].

Decision

111It is appropriate to set out the directions given by the trial Judge relevant to this ground. In doing so, it must be said that the directions addressed at some length a topic which was capable of briefer direction, such as that contained in the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book (to which reference will be made). However, the question for this Court is whether the directions given by the trial Judge, in the context of this trial, caused the trial to miscarry. 

112The trial Judge directed the jury in the following way (SU25-26):

""Now, there is one other important matter that I need to remind you about and explain a little further than I needed to at the commencement of the trial, with regard to the fact that you have the very difficult task of addressing seven counts, not one, in the indictment.

Each of those counts are independent of each other and therefore they require your consideration on that basis. You must, under no circumstance, say to yourselves, 'Well, we're not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the first count, we can assume we'd come to the same conclusion on all the others.' Under no circumstances are you to do anything remotely like that.

You have to take the counts one by one, you have to address the evidence that is relevant to that particular count and reach a conclusion. And it is not beyond your task that you might come up with a mixture of guilty and not guilty verdicts. That is quite consistent with the independence of each of the counts. They are not dependent on each other in any sense at all. However, if you were to come to such a conclusion, that is if you were to reach a verdict of not guilty on some counts and guilty on others, it could only be after a very careful examination of why you have done that.

For example, it would be very difficult to explain a series of verdicts of, let me just take for example, guilty on counts 1 and 3, not guilty on counts 4 and 5. It is possible that you might, because for example of the absence, in your judgment, of the element of aggravation in one and not the other. That might explain a different verdict. But what you have to be very careful about is, as I say, that such different outcomes have to be explicable and they have to be explicable by a sound reason.

What would not be acceptable and nobody is going to know about this, only you, and I am simply ensuring that you go about your deliberations appropriately, what would be quite unacceptable was for, for example, you to say to yourselves, 'Well, yes, we found the complainant with regard to count 1 a comprehensively unreliable witness. We just didn't believe her story.' But when we come to count 4 and 5, 'We believe everything she said.' Now, that would be very difficult to sustain, what would appear to be a quite demonstrable inconsistency in your own assessment of the evidence.

So, I just want to stress that in emphasising the importance of taking it count by count, you must not let yourselves stray into a situation where you are reaching your conclusions for demonstrably contradictory reasons and inconsistent reasons within your own judgment. You have to be able to explain why, in a reasoned and consistent way, you came to a different conclusion about the guilt of the accused in one but not another of the offences. But that is open to you, provided such reasons exist and provided you are satisfied that those reasons apply.""

113Thereafter, the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel addressed the trial Judge concerning these directions, seeking further directions (SU32-34).

114The following day, the trial Judge returned to this topic, and expanded on it in the following way (SU40-41):

""You will recall that I did spend some time explaining to you the particular care you must exercise in approaching a case of this kind where you have a multiplicity of counts in the indictment, and I stressed in explaining this to you yesterday, as I had explained to you at the beginning of the trial, that every count must be addressed independently, and you must come to a conclusion, if your verdict is to be one of guilty, which is based on your being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the evidence relevant to that particular count, that the Crown has made out a case on every relevant element of that particular offence.

I did, however, go on to explain as a matter of common sense that you cannot decide, on each of the independent counts, in a vacuum, that you will have made decisions about matters of general application, that it would be very difficult to contradict in a subsequent verdict on another count.

That is particularly true with regard to the complainant's evidence because of its central importance, and that is a matter that I had something to say about yesterday and about which I will have more to say in a moment.

But for example, if you have reasonable doubt about the evidence of the complainant on, let me say by way of example, count 1, and you accordingly return a verdict of not guilty, then you would have to consider very carefully whether you could come to a different conclusion on any of the other counts, if the reason is that you are not satisfied that the complainant is either a truthful and/or reliable witness. And that goes back to what I was saying, that if there are to be verdicts which might appear on the face of it to be inconsistent, there have to be very good reasons for it. And that is a particular example of what I was talking about yesterday.""

115His Honour referred to this topic again (SU49):

""Now, can I just conclude that particular aspect of the summing up ... - and that is that on this general question of lying it is a matter ultimately and as part of the task which I have now, I hope, very comprehensively explained to you, you have to undertake with regard to the evidence of the complainant in particular, but it must follow, it must follow from everything that I have said and I doubt whether it is even necessary to say this to you but I still am bound to do so, if you do come to the conclusion that the complainant was lying, then that, of course, would undermine totally the Crown case. As I say, I think that is self-evident, that evidence which you believe has been quite deliberately falsely constructed can be of no assistance at all in proving what the Crown, with regard to the complainant's evidence, must prove.

The other point is that what conclusion you come to, if you do, about lying - and of course you may say, 'Well, in the end, I really don't find anything in the evidence sufficient to satisfy me that the complainant was lying', that is open to you - but if you do say, 'Well, on particular matters I am of the conclusion, on all of the evidence, that she was deliberately lying', then it would be very difficult, for reasons I think I have explained in talking about the various counts in the indictment, to isolate that conclusion.

In other words, if you find that she was lying to you on certain matters, then it becomes very difficult for you to be satisfied that she was not on other matters.""

116In Markuleski, Spigelman CJ said at 121-122 [186]-[191]:

""[186] In the light of the number of cases it is desirable that the traditional direction as to treating each count separately is supplemented in a word against word case. Some reference ought to be made to the effect upon the assessment of the credibility of a complainant if the jury finds itself unable to accept the complainant's evidence with respect to any count.

[187] Some form of direction assisting the jury in this respect should be given, to employ the terminology found in Kilby and Davies 'as a general rule'. Its absence is not necessarily fatal (as it was not in Davies itself). Furthermore, as the joint judgment in Crofts affirmed, the 'general rule' does not apply 'where the peculiar facts of the case and the conduct of the trial do not suggest the need for a warning to restore a balance of fairness' (at 451).

[188] It is not necessary to specify any precise words for such a direction. That will depend on the circumstances of the case. It will often be appropriate to direct a jury that where they entertain a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of a complainant's evidence in relation to one or more counts, that must be taken into account in assessing the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant's evidence generally.

[189] On other occasions it may be appropriate for a judge to indicate to the jury, whilst making it clear that it remains a matter for the jury, that it might think that there was nothing to distinguish the evidence of the complainant on one count from his or her evidence on another count.

[190] Or it may be appropriate to indicate that, if the jury has a reasonable doubt about the complainant's credibility in relation to one count, it might believe it difficult to see how the evidence of the complainant could be accepted in relation to other counts.

[191] The precise terminology must remain a matter for the trial judge in all the particular circumstances of the specific case. The crucial matter is to indicate to the jury that any doubt they may form with respect to one aspect of the complainant's evidence, ought be considered by them when assessing the overall credibility of the complainant and, therefore, when deciding whether or not there was a reasonable doubt about the complainant's evidence with respect to other counts.""

117The suggested direction in the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book, derived from Markuleski, is to the following effect (at [5-1590]):

""Giving separate consideration to the individual counts means that you are entitled to bring in verdicts of guilty on some counts and not guilty on some other counts if there is a logical reason for that outcome.

If you were to find the accused not guilty on any count, particularly if that was because you had doubts about the reliability of the complainant's evidence, you would have to consider how that conclusion affected your consideration of the remaining counts.""

118As Spigelman CJ observed in Markuleski, there is no fixed formula of words to be used in a direction of this type. The question for this Court is whether the jury in this trial would have had communicated to it the concepts which lie at the heart of this direction. Although the directions given to the jury in this trial were lengthy, and extended some way beyond the succinct suggested direction in the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book, I am not persuaded that error has been demonstrated by the Appellant. 

119Moreover, I do not accept the further submission of the Appellant (at [108] above). Submissions were made by the Appellant's trial counsel to the jury on this issue and other issues and those arguments stood to be considered on their own merits. I am not persuaded that reference to an offensive instrument in the indictment would have affected the jury's approach in the manner suggested by counsel in support of this ground.

120In my view, the jury would have understood the proper approach to an assessment of multiple counts and multiple allegations emanating from a single complainant. Further, this was a trial where the alleged offences were said to have occurred over a short period of time as part of a continuing incident. Apart from Count 6, the commission of the acts was not in dispute. The issue was consent. The purpose of a Markuleski direction was achieved in this case.

121I reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 5 - The Trial Judge Erred in his Directions as to the Relevance of the Appellant's Good Character

122The Appellant gave evidence that he had never been charged, arrested or convicted of any offence in Japan or elsewhere. Detective Fiennes confirmed that the Appellant had no criminal history in Japan, following enquiries made with Interpol, and that he had no criminal history since his arrival in Australia in April 2011. Defence counsel addressed the jury on the Appellant's good character. 
 
123The trial Judge gave the following directions concerning the use of good character (SU53-54):

""Another important matter which arises out of some particular aspects of the evidence is that going to the character of the accused. You have heard - and again you were reminded of this by the counsel for the accused, Mr Taylor - that there is no evidence, the police were unable to find any evidence of any prior criminal record of any sort on the part of the accused or of any investigation of a criminal nature carried out, apart from this particular matter, with regard to the accused. He has, in that sense, a completely criminal-free record. That is, I must explain, regarded as evidence of good character.

Now, you are entitled to take that evidence into account in the accused's favour in generally addressing the questions you have to decide, that it might impact on your overall assessment of the evidence and that is a perfectly legitimate use to make of that evidence.

I have to say, however, that people of good character do commit crimes. In other words, it is not a defence. If somebody is of good character, they cannot simply put forward and say 'Therefore I didn't do it, you must find me not guilty', but it is something which you may nonetheless consider assists you in your overall assessment of the evidence and, in particular, it may have some bearing on your assessment of the accused as a truthful witness. But, please remember, that while it is relevant and while it may offer some assistance to you in those particular respects, it is not of itself a defence to the charges against the accused.""

124Defence counsel sought further directions from the trial Judge on the issue of character (SU75-76). In particular, counsel sought a direction that the jury could take into account the Appellant's good character by reasoning that such a person was unlikely to have committed the offences charged by the Crown. The trial Judge declined to give any further direction concerning character, expressing the view that the direction given was sufficient.

Submissions of the Parties

125Mr Hamill SC submitted that the directions concerning good character were deficient in this case. He submitted that a direction concerning good character had significance in relation to both the Appellant's propensity to commit the crime charged and his credibility: Melbourne v The Queen [1999] HCA 32; 198 CLR 1 at 14 [30]-[31]. It was submitted that what occurred here amounted to no more than a mention that the Appellant had no prior convictions and that this resulted in a miscarriage of justice: R v Robinson [1999] NSWCCA 172 at [24]-[25].

126Mr Hamill SC submitted that this was a case where it was appropriate for the trial Judge to direct the jury in an uncomplicated way in relation to the Appellant's character. 

127Whilst acknowledging that the trial Judge had directed the jury that they could use evidence of the Appellant's good character when ""addressing the questions [they] have to decide"" and when assessing ""the accused as a truthful witness"", it was submitted that his Honour did not specifically direct the jury that they could use the evidence when assessing the question of guilt, or whether it was likely that the Appellant committed the offence. Further, it was submitted that the good character direction had been weakened by use of words that the ""police were unable to find any evidence of any prior criminal record"" and that the Appellant had ""in that sense a completely criminal-free record"". 

128The Crown submitted that the directions given were sufficient in the circumstances of the trial, where the evidence of good character involved the absence of criminal record only, with no other evidence called in relation to the Appellant's general character. 

Decision

129In Melbourne v The Queen, McHugh J said at 14 [30]-[31]:

""[30] The preferable position is that the trial judge must retain a discretion as to whether to direct the jury on evidence of good character after evaluating its probative significance in relation to both:

(a) the accused's propensity to commit the crime charged; and

(b) the accused's credibility.

[31] The judge may conclude that the good character evidence adduced is of probative significance in relation to (a) only, (b) only, both (a) and (b) or neither (a) nor (b), and can direct (or not direct) the jury accordingly. Whether the discretion has miscarried in a particular case will depend upon the facts of that case.""

130Here, the Appellant's trial counsel sought to rely upon evidence of the Appellant's good character in both respects identified by McHugh J in Melbourne v The Queen. The Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book (at [2-370]) contains a relatively straightforward suggested direction concerning good character. The trial Judge did not follow this suggested direction in this case. Of course, his Honour was not bound to do so. 

131The issue for this Court, however, is whether the directions actually given involve misdirections to the jury on this issue. I am not persuaded that they do. The jury was reminded of the evidence concerning absence of criminal convictions, and was given directions that the Appellant's good character could be taken into account in addressing the Appellant's guilt, and also in the assessment of his evidence. Nothing said in R v Robinson assists the Appellant in this case.

132A direction that good character is not a defence is, of course, an orthodox direction: Abbosh v R [2011] NSWCCA 265 at [100].

133Although a simpler formula of words would have been preferable, I am not persuaded that the direction given to the jury failed to communicate the use which the jury could make of evidence of the Appellant's absence of prior convictions and his good character. Nor am I persuaded that the words used by the trial Judge served to weaken the direction. 

134I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 6 - The Verdicts are Unreasonable and Cannot be Supported Having Regard to the Evidence

Some Preliminary Observations

135It was submitted for the Appellant that, upon a thorough review of the evidence in the case, the Court would entertain a reasonable doubt as to the Appellant's guilt on all counts. It was submitted, as well, that the concerns of the Court would be exacerbated by the matters complained of by the Appellant, which have given rise to the preceding grounds of appeal. 

136Of the grounds considered so far, only Ground 2A has been upheld. All other grounds have been rejected. Although the Crown, at one point, sought to advance an argument that the convictions on the s.61J counts could stand by application of the proviso, it is difficult to see how this conclusion could be reached on this appeal. There was a failure to direct the jury upon the correct circumstances of aggravation on the s.61J counts, and an associated failure to link those directions of law with the facts of the case. I do not think that the proviso can be utilised in these circumstances to allow the s.61J convictions to stand. 

137Further, the evidence that any threat was by means of an offensive instrument was somewhat tenuous. This is not because of any concern with respect to the Complainant's credibility. Rather, her evidence was that this phase of the incident occurred in darkness. She believed there was some sort of weapon involved, but she did not see it. It was her evidence that the Appellant said later that he had a key, but she had not seen it.

138The ground of appeal which contends that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, ought be considered in this appeal, in respect of the s.61J(1) counts, by reference to the elements of offences under s.61I Crimes Act 1900. 

139If the Court upheld Ground 6 by reference to the s.61L counts and the alternative verdicts under s.61I, then the Appellant would be entitled to an acquittal on all counts. 

140If, on the other hand, the Appellant does not make good Ground 6 in this way, then the verdicts of the jury on the s.61L counts will stand and, subject to compliance with s.7(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, it would be open to this Court to substitute verdicts of guilty under s.61I, with respect to the s.61J counts. 

141It is useful to spell out this approach before moving to a consideration of Ground 6 in the particular circumstances of this case.

The Unreasonable Verdicts Ground

142The submissions for the Appellant pointed to features of the evidence which, it was contended, would see a conclusion reached by this Court that the verdicts were unreasonable so that the Appellant ought be acquitted on all counts. 

143The Crown submitted that this was a strong Crown case, based not only upon the evidence of the Complainant, but also strong corroborative evidence in the form of complaint evidence and medical evidence. 

Evidence in the Trial

144In approaching the evidence, it is necessary to bear in mind that there was no issue at the trial that the sexual acts alleged by the Crown (with the exception of Count 6) took place. The central issue was whether the sexual activity was consensual. 
 
The Complainant

145The Complainant, a 29-year old Japanese woman, had come to Australia at the start of 2011 for a working holiday and to improve her English. The Complainant gave evidence through an interpreter. A brief overview of the Complainant's account was given earlier in this judgment. Given her significance as a witness, it is appropriate to recount her evidence in a little greater detail for the purpose of addressing the present ground of appeal.

146The Complainant recounted her contact with the Appellant leading to the two of them attending her residence at Chatswood. After dinner, the Appellant was seated on a sofa and the Complainant on a chair. The Appellant commented that they were sitting some distance from each other, and he told her to sit near him on the sofa. She moved to the sofa and the Appellant pulled her over so that she was sitting between his legs. The Complainant said, ""What are you doing? Please stop"". The Complainant said, ""We just met each other. We're not going out together. We're just friends, so this is very strange to do that"". At this time, the Appellant was pulling her over and holding her strongly so that she would sit on his lap.

147The Appellant was talking about himself and showed the Complainant a photograph of himself on his mobile phone modelling. He spoke about famous people that he knew.

148Late in the evening, the Complainant said, ""It's a bit late. Maybe you better go home"". There was some discussion as to whether buses would be running at that time.

149After the Appellant left the Complainant's unit to catch a bus home, he returned and said there was no bus, requesting to stay at the Complainant's place. It appears from the evidence that the Appellant rang the Complainant shortly before returning to her home. The Complainant gave evidence that she was a little bit awkward about the Appellant staying, but that he did not look like a bad person, so she did not say no. She said to the Appellant clearly, ""I can let you stay here but don't do anything to me"".

150The Complainant told the Appellant that she was going to have a shower and she told him, ""Please do not come in"". After she emerged from the shower, the Complainant saw the Appellant on the couch and he appeared to be asleep. She was relieved and went back to her room. She changed into her pyjamas which consisted of a nightdress, underpants and a sports bra. She went to sleep straight away.

151Some time later, the Complainant awoke suddenly and realised the Appellant was on top of her and he was pushing her neck down with one arm. At first, she thought he was playing and she said, ""What are you doing?"". He pushed her down with real power. He was serious and said, ""You steal my $50.00, you took it"". The Complainant said that he had so much power that she thought she may be killed. She said to him, ""Of course I didn't take - of course I'm not going to do that"". The Appellant said, ""Don't say anything. Just say it yes or no"". He said, ""If you scream, I'll rip your ear off"". 

152The Complainant said that the Appellant held ""this kind of weapon thing"", and said to her, ""Do you want me to push hole with this on your body?"". He was holding the item on his right-hand side and she could not see what it was. The room was dark. The Complainant said that she was scared and shaking, and she did what he said. The Appellant had his hand around her neck. She screamed and he became angry and punched her in the stomach.

153The Appellant started taking his belt off and repeatedly told her to shut up. He pulled his jeans down and put his erect penis near her face. It was very close to her face, almost in her mouth. He said to her, ""Lick it"". He put his penis in her mouth and she had to lick it. This lasted for less than one minute (Count 1). 

154The Appellant then moved her pyjamas and bra up and she had to show him her chest. The Appellant then licked her chest. He had previously said to her, ""Don't say anything"" so she was scared. The Appellant licked her on the breast for a short period (Count 2). 

155The Appellant then put his finger in her vagina. The Complainant did not know if it was one finger or more, but she felt pain. She said he was moving his finger fast. She said in evidence, ""It was so painful, I think maybe that it was so fast moving"" (Count 3). This did not last for very long. When this occurred, the Complainant was lying on her bed and he was on top of her. 

156The Appellant then kissed her and as he was doing that, he was dripping saliva into her mouth. His lips were about five centimetres from hers when he did this (Count 6).

157During this time in the bedroom, the Appellant was ordering her to do things such as ""lick it"" or ""drink it"". He pulled the Complainant's hair at one stage. He then put his penis in her mouth again. At this time, when her teeth touched his penis, he said, ""It's painful"" and he slapped her on the head. The slap was to the side of her head above her ear. His penis was in her mouth for about the same time as before, about one minute (Count 4).

158The Appellant then put his penis into her vagina and he said, in a threatening manner, ""Maybe I'm going to put sperm into your vagina"". The Complainant was in the same position on the bed and she said, ""No, no"". The Appellant did not use a condom. He had his penis in her vagina for less than one minute (Count 5).

159After the Appellant took his penis out of her vagina, he put it into her mouth and ejaculated in her mouth. He told her to drink it. The Complainant gave evidence, ""When he put his penis in my mouth it was so awful and I didn't want to do it, it was so awful, but he told me to drink or drink it all but I couldn't refuse because he might hit me again so I did"". The semen went on to her chin and hair as well (Count 7).

160After this had occurred, the Appellant changed his attitude and his tone of voice seemed normal.

161In relation to the item that the Appellant had in his hand when the Complainant first woke up, she said that she did not see it, but he later told her it was a key. 

162The Complainant said that the Appellant fell asleep. After a while, she sought his permission to go to the bathroom. She used the toilet and noticed bleeding from her vagina. She was not menstruating at this time. 

163The Complainant said that she considered running from the unit, but thought that the Appellant may catch her trying to leave, so she returned to the bed.

164Some time later, the conversation again turned to money. The Appellant told her that she had taken his money and she denied this.

165The Complainant said, ""Why you have to inflict this kind of violence on me just because you thought I stole your money?"". He replied, ""You asked for it. I cooked dinner for you, I entertained you, you enjoyed last night. So that's what you get. If you were at my place you would have done the same thing"". They argued about the money again. The Complainant said, ""What would you do then if you are in my place, that you accused for something you didn't do, like stealing money?"". He replied, ""If people believe what other people say all the time, what's going to happen to society. We don't need a court"".

166The Complainant told the Appellant that she did not wish to see him again.

167After the Appellant left, the Complainant called her mother in Japan on her mobile phone. As the Complainant spoke, she started to cry and she told her mother, ""I was raped"" and explained what had happened. She asked her mother's advice as to whether she should go to the police and her mother suggested that she should go.

168After that, the Complainant called her host mother in Sydney, Miwako Hishi. The Complainant told Ms Hishi that she had been assaulted and asked her advice, and Ms Hishi said that she would call the police.

169The Complainant went back to her room and examined herself and realised that she had semen on her chin and hair. She saved some of her hair (bearing semen) and wrapped it in a tissue and placed it on top of a desk. This was later given to police. She undressed and had a shower. When she did this, she noticed a blood stain about the size of a $0.20 piece on the back of her nightie. She washed the sheets and her pyjamas and underpants. 

170Soon after, Ms Hishi and the police came to her unit. The police took her to hospital where she was examined by Dr Shauna Hayes. The Complainant made a statement to police. The Complainant gave evidence that, before the Appellant arrived that day, she did not have any injuries around her neck or collarbone. 

171The Complainant did not see or hear from the Appellant again after he left her unit on 12 May 2011. 

172Soon after, she moved out of the Chatswood unit and stayed for a time with Ms Hishi and her husband. On 7 July 2011, the Complainant returned to Japan.

173The Complainant was cross-examined at some length. Amongst other things, it was suggested to her that she had made a false claim of sexual assault against the Appellant, motivated by the prospect of financial gain.

Other Crown Witnesses

174The Complainant's mother gave evidence of the telephone call to her on 12 May 2011, in which the Complainant was crying and told her mother, ""I was raped"". In answer to her mother, the Complainant said that the assailant was ""someone acquainted at the place where people get information of Australia"". The Complainant said, ""I thought this man was kind, and that I could trust"".

175The Complainant's mother gave the following account of other things said by the Complainant in this telephone conversation:

""I heard she said he wanted to eat something, and he wanted to eat something cooked. She said he wanted to eat something cooked, home cooked at my daughter's place. She wasn't sure, but then she thought she could trust him, so she took him to her place and to eat something. It became too late to catch any public transportation, so he asked if he could stay overnight. 'So I felt sorry for him, so I let him stay overnight. When I woke up during the night, he was in my bedroom,' and he accused her of stealing money. My daughter insisted that she didn't steal money, but he said there are only two people here, and money is missing, and it's obvious that she stole the money.

He said - she said he had something in his hand, and it was too dark and she couldn't see it. But he's threatened her that he will make hole on her. So then she found out later it was a paper. She thought he was going to strangle her and kill her. That's all I heard over the phone. After the phone call we just stayed, waited for her to contact us, because we didn't arouse her and hurt her feeling even more.""

176The Complainant's mother said that the Complainant was ""crying"" and ""was very emotional"" during the telephone call.

177Ms Miwako Hishi gave evidence that she received a telephone call on 12 May 2011 from the Complainant, who said ""a terrible thing"" had happened and her voice was trembling. The Complainant said that ""I was nearly killed"". Ms Hishi asked what happened and the Complainant said, ""I was nearly strangled'. Ms Hishi did not testify that the Complainant said she had been raped. Ms Hishi asked the Complainant if she could get her husband to contact the police, and the Complainant agreed that this should happen. Ms Hishi said that, during the telephone call, the Complainant ""was quiet"". Ms Hishi could sense that this was ""quite different"" to the way the Complainant normally was. Ms Hishi said ""she didn't want to tell me exactly what happened on the telephone straight away"" but that was ""kind of [the] Japanese way"".

178Thereafter, the police were contacted by Warren Head (Ms Hishi's husband) and Detective Senior Constable Fiennes met Ms Hishi at the Complainant's unit later that day. Ms Hishi acted as interpreter when the police spoke to the Complainant. After then, the Complainant went to live with Ms Hishi and her husband for some time. Ms Hishi noticed that the Complainant was quieter than before and did not want to come out of her room as much. 

179Dr Shauna Hayes gave evidence that she examined the Complainant on 12 May 2011 at Royal North Shore Hospital. Dr Hayes obtained a history from the Complainant, with the assistance of an interpreter, which was consistent with the Complainant's evidence of events leading up to the alleged sexual assault. The Complainant gave an account of the various acts giving rise to the charges, once again in a manner consistent with the Complainant's evidence at trial. 

180Having taken a history from the Complainant, Dr Hayes conducted a physical examination. She noticed that the Complainant was very distressed. She had a circular blue mark on the outside of her left arm. The Complainant had four red marks with red lines radiating out, which the doctor determined were bruises on her neck. There was a small area of roughening of the skin above the left clavicle. On genital examination, Dr Hayes observed that the entire inner aspect of the labia minora was abraded and roughed up. The hymen was also abraded. 

181Dr Hayes expressed the opinion that the bruises on the neck were likely to have been caused by blunt trauma, including pressure. It was the doctor's opinion that the genital abrasions were caused by forceful penetration, pressure combined with movement. 

182Dr Hayes agreed that the history given by the Complainant of a hand being placed around her throat was possibly consistent with the observations made on examination of the Complainant's neck. Dr Hayes agreed that the genital abrasions she observed were consistent with the history of a finger being inserted roughly and/or a combination of a penis being in her vagina. 

183Under cross-examination, Dr Hayes said that she was not able to say when the bruises were caused. The doctor agreed that the observations to the vagina were consistent with consensual sex. In re-examination, Dr Hayes said that consensual intercourse does not usually cause vaginal abrasions, though it could. From her observations of the abrasions, she said that the Complainant would have experienced pain.

184Michelle Franco of the NSW Forensic and Analytical Science Service, examined various samples. Amongst other findings, the semen on the Complainant's hair, contained in the tissue, was tested for DNA and had the same profile as the Appellant.

Defence Witnesses

185The Appellant gave evidence at trial through an interpreter. He maintained that the sexual contact between the Complainant and himself was consensual. A summary of his evidence was provided earlier in this judgment (at [25]-[33]). He was cross-examined on a range of matters, including areas where his account to the police during the recorded interview on 15 June 2011 varied from his evidence at trial.

186Takeshi Hagiwara, a Japanese Professor of Law, gave evidence in the Appellant's case by audio-visual link. His evidence related to the crime of rape in Japan. He said that the Japanese system allowed for cash settlements to be made to a Complainant to withdraw the complaint.

Submissions of the Parties

187Mr Hamill SC submitted that the Crown case rested almost entirely on the evidence of the Complainant, and that a close analysis of her evidence would cause the Court misgivings as to the Complainant's credibility. Reliance was placed on what were said to be improbabilities, inconsistencies and evidence suggesting a possible motive to make a false allegation of sexual assault.

188Submissions advanced for the Appellant included the following:

(a) the Complainant's account of waking up the Appellant, after the acts of sexual assault, was highly improbable;

(b) the Complainant's account of allowing the Appellant back into the apartment, after he had earlier insisted upon her sitting on his lap on the couch, was improbable;

(c) the Complainant's evidence as to why she did not want to see the Appellant again was not plausible;

(d) the Complainant may have been motivated to make the allegations of sexual assault in an attempt to extract a cash payment from the Appellant;

(e) there were suggested inconsistencies in the account of the Complainant concerning the Appellant being asleep and snoring after the sexual assault;

(f) there were said to be significant inconsistencies between the account of the Complainant and of the complaint witness, Ms Hishi, with Ms Hishi not mentioning that the Complainant said she had been raped;

(g) there were said to be discrepancies in the evidence of the Complainant concerning the time when she last saw the Appellant before the night in question, and the Complainant's evidence that the Appellant had said to her that she had ""asked for it"", this not having been said by the Complainant in her statement to the police;

(h) other suggested discrepancies were relied upon including differing periods over which the assaults were said to have taken place, and the Complainant's capacity to see in the bedroom which was said to be dark;

(i) suggested inconsistencies in the Complainant's account as to the holding of a weapon, a key, with the Complainant saying she could not see anything at the time, but that the Appellant later said he had a key. 

189It was submitted for the Appellant that the medical evidence was equivocal, with the evidence of bruising being inconclusive. The medical evidence, it was submitted, was consistent with consensual sex. It was submitted that the evidence of the Appellant was clear and that the Crown Prosecutor's criticism of his evidence at trial, involving things said in evidence which he had not mentioned during the police interview, was not such as to remove the doubt which arose from a review of the prosecution evidence. It was necessary to take into account, as well, the Appellant's prior good character. 

190The Crown submitted that this was a strong Crown case and that there was ample evidence to support verdicts adverse to the Appellant.

Decision

191The task of the Court in determining a ground of appeal such as this was summarised in Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126; 210 A Crim R 326 at 332-333 [31]-[34]:

""31 In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, and restated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both to its sufficiency and quality. This involves a question of fact. The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged in the first count: Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571 at 575 [11]-[14], 576-577 [20]-[22]. 

32 In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128]. This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury. This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events: Rasic v R at [29]. 

33 In some cases, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not seen or heard the witnesses at trial may have a bearing on the outcome of an appeal on an unreasonable verdict ground. In M v The Queen, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson Toohey JJ said at 494-495: 

'In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above.'

34 The M v The Queen formulation of the task of this Court has been emphasised by the High Court in later cases: The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38; 85 ALJR 8 at 14 [33]; SKA v The Queen at 575 [13].""

192I keep in mind the experience of the criminal courts that victims of sexual assault do not necessarily respond in ways that accord with some mechanical or predetermined view as to how such a victim should respond. Much depends on the evidence in the particular case, including the association between the parties and the duration of that association. 

193I have undertaken an independent assessment of the entirety of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and to its quality.

194The jury had the significant advantage of seeing and hearing the Complainant and the Appellant give evidence. I have kept in mind that each of the Complainant and the Appellant gave evidence through interpreters. The courts have recognised that, where key witnesses give evidence through an interpreter, it may limit the ability of a tribunal of fact to assess demeanour as an aid to fact finding: Goodrich Aerospace Pty Limited v Arsic [2006] NSWCA 187; 66 NSWLR 186 at 190 [21]-[22].

195However, the subject matter of a trial may also affect a jury's ability to make an assessment of the credibility and reliability of individual witnesses, even where evidence is given through interpreters. In Geggo v R [2013] NSWCCA 7, with the agreement of Hoeben JA and Button J, I said at [145]:

""However, the jury observed the witnesses, and in particular the Appellant and the Complainant, giving evidence on matters where sexual conduct was the topic, with an associated question of consent. Even where witnesses are giving evidence through interpreters, a jury will be in a position to make assessments concerning the witnesses and their reactions to questions put to them on topics such as this. The jury had this advantage in this trial.""

196Those comments are equally pertinent to the present case.

197The convictions of the Appellant depend substantially upon the testimony of the Complainant. She and the Appellant had known each other for a short time only. They shared a meal in her unit, but then the Complainant insisted that the Appellant leave to go home. This was not the conduct of a person who (on the Appellant's account) was flirting and being sexually provocative on his return. 

198Once the Appellant informed her that it was too late for him to catch a bus home, the Complainant was prepared to allow him to stay the night, provided that he stayed on the couch in the lounge room. On the Complainant's account, it was the Appellant who embarked upon a course of conduct involving forced sexual activity. The Complainant's account is credible, and is supported strongly by other evidence. 

199There was immediate complaint by the Complainant to her mother in which a complaint of rape was made. The complaint to Ms Hishi of the use of violence, without express reference to sexual assault, does not diminish the strength of the early complaint made to the Complainant's mother. Both the mother and Ms Hishi testified of the distress of the Complainant whilst making these early complaints.

200A complainant who has been sexually assaulted may display outward signs of distress after the assault, and evidence of distress tends to prove that the complainant was sexually assaulted: Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 (""Papakosmas"") at 321 [78] (McHugh J). The recency and spontaneity of the complaint, and its consistency with other aspects of the Complainant's account, bear upon its probative strength: Papakosmas at 311 [41] (Gleeson CJ and Hayne J). In the circumstances of this case, where (as in Papakosmas) the critical issue was consent, the complaint evidence of the Complainant's mother and Ms Hishi was highly probative of the critical issue and was likely to be reliable: Papakosmas at 328 [98] (McHugh J).

201The medical evidence confirmed physical injuries and bruising consistent with forceful acts being perpetrated against the Complainant. The bruises to the Complainant's neck, observed by Dr Hayes, supported the Complainant's account that the Appellant held her tightly by the throat. The genital injuries also supported the Complainant's account.

202Trial counsel for the Appellant pointed to areas of inconsistency and discrepancies in the evidence of the Complainant, and these matters were relied upon again in this Court. It is necessary to keep in mind the observations of McHugh J in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 534:

""It is the everyday experience of the courts that honest witnesses are frequently in error about the details of events. The more accounts that they are asked to give the greater is the chance that there will be discrepancies about details and even inconsistencies in the various accounts. Of course, it is legitimate to test the honesty or accuracy of a witness's evidence by analysing the discrepancies and inconsistencies in his or her accounts of an incident. In a case where accuracy of recollection is vital - such as the account of a conversation in a fraud case or the description of a person where identity is the issue - discrepancies and inconsistencies in the witness's account may make it impossible to accept that person's evidence, no matter how honest he or she appears to be. But in other cases, discrepancies and inconsistencies may be of far less importance if the honesty of the witness, as opposed to the accuracy of the detail, is the crucial issue. If a jury thinks that the demeanour of the witness or the probability of occurrence of the witness's general account is persuasive, they may reasonably think that discrepancies or even inconsistencies concerning details are of little moment.""

203These observations have particular application to the present case. See also the observations to a similar effect of Giles JA (Hidden and McCallum JJ agreeing) in Alseedi v R [2009] NSWCCA 185 at [48].

204The jury had an opportunity to observe both the Complainant and the Appellant give evidence over an extended period at the trial. It is clear that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual activity between the two persons was not consensual. 

205The Appellant's account contained significant implausible aspects. There were notable differences between his account to police on 15 June 2011 and his evidence to the jury at trial. His credibility was damaged in substantial ways at trial.

206The suggestion that the Complainant was, in some way, motivated by money to make a false allegation against the Appellant is implausible, when viewed with all the evidence at trial. In reality, the evidence of Professor Hagiwara did not go to any realistic issue in the trial.

207The assertion by the Appellant that the Complainant had stolen $50.00 from him, squarely denied by the Complainant, is a curious feature of the case. However, whatever the making of this allegation may say about the thought processes of the Appellant, it does not operate, in any realistic or plausible way, adversely to the Crown in this case.

208Like the jury, I am satisfied, to the criminal standard, that the Appellant is guilty of the two s.61L offences charged in the indictment.

209It has not been demonstrated that the verdicts of guilty upon the charges under s.61L are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. 

210The enquiry with respect to the other counts on the indictment, for reasons explained earlier, will be answered by reference to s.61I Crimes Act 1900. As the jury must have been, I am satisfied, to the criminal standard, that the Appellant is guilty of each of the five offences under s.61I, which were available as alternative verdicts at the trial. 

211It was open to the jury to convict the Appellant on each of the counts alleging offences under s.61J of the statutory alternative under s.61I of the Act. 

212I would reject the sixth ground of appeal.

Application of s.7(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912

213Before this Court can return verdicts on lesser charges under s.7(2), the Court must apply the rigorous approach outlined in Spies v The Queen [2000] HCA 43; 201 CLR 603 (""Spies""). 

214Offences under s.61I are wholly included offences by reference to ss.61J and 61Q: Spies at 611-612 [23]-[24]. 

215I am satisfied that the verdicts of the jury demonstrate that the jury was affirmatively satisfied of facts that constitute each of the s.61I offences: Spies at 613 [27]. 

216The power conferred by s.7(2) is a very useful one which, in appropriate cases, will result in the saving of time and expense and avoid the inconvenience and worry of victims and witnesses having to testify once again before a jury: Spies at 620 [47].

217The power under s.7(2) is to be exercised with great caution: Spies at 620 [47]. The need for caution is directed to the issue whether it really does appear that the jury was so satisfied of the facts constituting the other offence: Spies at 621 [48].

218I am entirely satisfied that it is appropriate to utilise the section in this case.

219The appropriate course is for this Court to use s.7(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to convict the Appellant of the alternative charges and to remit those, together with the s.61L convictions, to the District Court for sentence.

220The sentencing proceedings should be relisted in the District Court at the earliest available time. Bail was granted by the District Court on 11 December 2012. The Appellant is required to appear in the District Court in accordance with that grant of bail.

Orders

221I propose the following orders:

(a) appeal against conviction with respect to Counts 2 and 6, the s.61L Crimes Act 1900 counts, is dismissed;

(b) with respect to Counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7, the s.61J(1) Crimes Act 1900 counts, Ground 2A is upheld;

(c) pursuant to s.7(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, instead of allowing the appeal with respect to Counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7, substitute for the verdict found by the jury on each count, a verdict of guilty under s.61I Crimes Act 1900 of having sexual intercourse without consent;

(d) pursuant to s.12(2) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, remit the proceedings to the District Court so that the Appellant may be sentenced for the five offences under s.61I Crimes Act 1900 and the two offences under s.61L Crimes Act 1900.

222PRICE J: I find myself in complete agreement with the judgment of Johnson J. I should add in respect of ground 6 that having considered the totality of the evidence before the jury, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant is guilty of the offence against s 61L (counts 2 and 6) and, in respect of counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7, of offences against s 61l of having sexual intercourse without consent. 

223I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J. 

224RA HULME J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Johnson J in draft.

225I agree with his Honour's reasons and conclusions in relation to grounds 1 to 5.

226In relation to ground 6, my own assessment of the evidence at trial leads me to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant is guilty of the offences against s 61L and, in relation to counts 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7, of offences against s 61I. 

227Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J.

		18 October 2013",2013-10-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706021,R v S M [2013] NSWSC 1542,"Judgment

1On 11 September 2013 SM was arrested and charged with robbery in company and at the time of the robbery, inflicting grievous bodily harm on the victim. He has also been charged with disposing of some of the property stolen. SM had been in custody ever since and seeks bail. The charge against him is next listed for mention in the Campbelltown Children's Court on 16 December 2013.

2The victim was walking through a reserve at about 10.45 pm on 6 September 2013 when he was set upon by the Applicant and then some 4 other youths. The victim was punched and after he had fallen to the ground, kicked by some of his assailants and also stomped on by some, including, according to some of the evidence before me, the Applicant. The victim was left screaming uncontrollably. Injuries to the victim as the result of this attack were very serious. His brain and vision were damaged and he suffered multiple fractures of the nose and eye socket. Surgery to insert titanium plates to the right side of his face and to reconstruct his right ear was necessary. Items stolen included a scooter, backpack and mobile phone. It seems that in the period immediately before the attack the offenders had been drinking alcohol in the reserve. 

3On 11 September 2013 the Applicant was within a few days of attaining 16. He has not previously been charged with any offence and has the support of his parents and siblings. He voluntarily attended a police station with his sister and admitted some participation in the attack, albeit not to the extent outlined above. During his bail hearing the Applicant did not give evidence but his brother did. His brother said that he was talking on behalf of the family a number of other members of which were in court. 

4On the Applicant's behalf it is proposed that conditions of bail include requirements that he live with his sister who is not employed outside her home, that he remain in her premises except for the purpose of attending work or school or in the company of his parents or siblings, and that he not associate with his co-offenders. The brother's evidence indicated that the family was close, none had been in trouble with the police and the Applicant would derive a deal of support from them. It is proposed that the Applicant undertake a full time apprenticeship. There was no challenge to this evidence which I accept.

5The Applicant's father has health issues and is not employed. The Applicant's mother works full time and is willing to deposit $1,000 by way of surety. 

6The outcome of these proceedings must be governed by the terms of the Bail Act 1978. The offence is one mentioned in s 9 of that Act and as a result there is no presumption favouring a grant of bail. Accordingly my decision is to be made by reference to the terms of s 32. So far as presently relevant that section provides:

(1)(1) In making a determination as to the grant of bail to an accused person, an authorised officer or court shall to take into consideration the following matters (so far as they can be reasonably ascertained) and the following matters only:

(a) the probability of whether or not the person will appear in court in respect of the offence for which bail is being considered, having only regard to

(i)...

(b) the interest of a person, having regard only to

(i)...

(b)(i) the protection of:

(i)...

(c) the protection and welfare of the community, having regard only to

i) the nature and seriousness of the offence, in particular whether the offence is of a sexual or violent nature or involves the possession or use of an offensive weapon or instrument within the meaning of the Crimes Act 1900, and

(ii) whether or not the person has failed, or has been arrested for an anticipated failure, to observe a reasonable bail condition previously imposed in respect of the offence, and

(iii) the likelihood of the person interfering with evidence, witnesses or jurors, and

(iv) whether or not it is likely that the person will commit any serious offence while at liberty on bail, but the authorised officer or court may have regard to this likelihood only if permitted to do so under subsection (2), and

(v) if the offence for which bail is being considered is a serious offence, whether, at the time the person is alleged to have committed the offence, the person had been granted bail, or released on parole, in connection with any other serious offence, and

(vi) if the offence for which bail is being considered is an offence that involves the possession or use of 


(2) The authorised officer or court may, for the purposes of (1)(c)(iv), have regard to whether or not it is likely that the person will commit one or more, serious offences while at liberty on bail if the officer or court is satisfied:

(a)...

7In light of the Applicant's past and his brother's evidence I am satisfied that there is a high likelihood that, if admitted to bail, the Applicant will appear in court as required. I am also satisfied that the Applicant's interests argue for bail being granted. There is nothing to suggest that the victim of the offence or any other person falling within the terms of paragraph (b1) of s 32(1) is in need of any protection.

8I turn then to the terms of s 32(1)(c). It inspires a number of remarks. Firstly there is in the opening line reference to ""protection"" and ""welfare"". Prima facie, both because of their meanings and the use of the 2 terms they mean different things. Protection is directed to the future; Welfare, while it may include protection, has a wider operation albeit in the context of whether bail should be granted, again it is the future that is being considered.

9Secondly, though all sub-paragraphs are directed to providing guidance for the future, in their terms some of the sub-paragraphs look to the past and some to the future. In the former category are sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), (v) and (vi): In the latter group are sub-paragraphs (iii) and (iv).

10Thirdly, the restrictive terms of sub-paragraph (iv) and sub-section (2) seem to me to provide a context against which the operation of sub-paragraph (i) is to be considered. Putting aside the circumstance where some further offence might constitute interference such as contemplated by sub-paragraph (iii), sub-paragraph (iv) indicates that the possibility of an Applicant re-offending by committing a serious offence may only be taken into account if the Court is able to conclude as envisaged by sub-section (2). What then is the significance to be given to sub-paragraph (i) and to the offence referred to therein, i.e. the offence with which the Applicant has been charged? 

11Given the limitations in sub-paragraph (iv) and sub-section (2), except insofar as that offence is the offence with which the Applicant has been charged may also have a relevance under sub-paragraph (iv), it does not seem to me that that offence can have anything to say on the topic of the protection of the community. It can however bear on the topic of welfare. Thus it seems to me that it can reasonably be said that the welfare of the community is advanced by having incarcerated, and not at liberty and free to re-offend, those who, on reasonable grounds, appear to have committed serious, particularly very serious, offences, even if those offences are not yet proved. Notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, it is something of an affront to civilised society to have walking around someone who, for example, seems to be clearly guilty of such an offence merely because he has not been convicted.

12I have said enough to indicate that the offence alleged against the Applicant is very serious and this, even if one takes into account as circumstances of the offence matters such as the Applicant's youth and, as appears to be the case, that the offence was unpremeditated. While a bail application is not a trial and I am not called upon to decide whether the Applicant in fact be guilty, it is clear that the evidence against him is strong. The terms of paragraph (c) preclude me, in making a judgment under that paragraph, having regard to matters such as the undesirability of locking up young persons and in the circumstances of the case I am satisfied that the welfare of the community argues against a grant of bail.

13In so concluding I do not disregard the innumerable statements over the years to the effect that the refusal of bail should never occur as a form of punishment and that the grant or refusal of bail is determined principally on the probability or otherwise of an applicant appearing at Court - see for example R v Brown [2013] NSWCCA 178. Given the terms in which s 32 of the Bail Act is expressed, I am not sure that a statement to the latter effect gives sufficient weight to paragraphs (b) and (c) of s 32(1) particularly once the conclusion be reached that ""Section 32 is a mandatory, exhaustive and exclusive statement of the criteria to be considered in bail applications."" - R v Hilton (1986) 7 NSWLR 745 at 750. While s 32(1)(a) and (b) are important, so is paragraph s 32(1)(c).

14Furthermore, if bail is denied because the welfare of the community is furthered by doing so, that denial is not imposed as a punishment. It is no more a punishment than if bail is denied on any other of the grounds set out in s 32(1)(b1) or (c). 

15It becomes then a case of weighing up the competing considerations that arise under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). There is no easy way of comparing the weight to be given to the various matters and the result must to a large extent be subjective. In the result the conclusion at which I have arrived is that, notwithstanding the view I have formed about the welfare of the community, I should grant bail.

16Subject to some further definition the terms of bail advanced on the Applicant's behalf are satisfactory. Accordingly, subject to any matter of detail either of the parties may wish to raise, the order I propose is:-

In respect of all offences in respect of which the Applicant is due to appear at the Campbelltown Children's Court on 16 December next, I grant bail subject to the following conditions:

1. The Applicant is to enter into an agreement to observe the following requirements as to his conduct while at liberty on bail:-

(i) He is to reside with XXX XXX at XX XXXX XXXX Smithfield;

(ii) He is not to leave XX XXXX XXXX Smithfield except for the purposes of attending work or school or in the company of one or more of his parents or siblings viz XX, XXX, XXXX, XXXXX, XXXXXX or XXXXXXX;

(iii) He is to be of good behaviour;

(iv) He is to appear at the Campbelltown Children's Court on 16 December 2013 and on such other dates to which the proceedings against him may be adjourned;

(v) He is to report to the officer in charge of the Fairfield Police Station once on each Monday, Wednesday and Friday between the hours of 8am and 8pm;

(vi) He is not to associate with XX, XXX, XXXX, XXXXX, or XXXXXX;

(vii) He is not to contact directly or indirectly, except through his legal advisors, any witness of whom he has received or receives notice of that person is likely to be called at his trial or committal proceedings; and

(viii) He is not to consume alcohol or enter any licensed premises.

2. Bail will be further conditioned upon:

(i) One acceptable person depositing $1,000 in cash and entering into an agreement to forfeit such amount if the applicant fails to comply with his bail undertaking.

3. Bail is to be automatically revoked in the event of any breach of any one of these conditions and the applicant may there upon be arrested by any police officer. 

17I record my view that XX XXXX is an acceptable person. 

18Given that the Applicant is a juvenile, and it appears that a number of his co-offenders are also, I further order:-

There be no publication, beyond the parties to the proceedings and their legal advisers, the Applicant's family and any authorities concerned in the implementation, enforcement or variation of this decision, of the names and address mentioned in the conditions of bail.

2706022,Shedden v R [2013] NSWCCA 225,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offence and sentenceOn 16 April 2012 the trial of the applicant for the murder of Joshua Maynard at Raymond Terrace on 29 June 2010 was listed for hearing.  On 17 April 2012 he was arraigned on that charge to which he entered a plea of not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter.  The Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment.
2On 6 July 2012 Fullerton J sentenced the applicant for that offence - imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months, commencing 7 July 2010 and expiring 6 April 2017 with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months, expiring 6 July 2019.
3Pursuant to s5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him on a single ground of appeal:
The sentencing judge erred in failing to apply the parity principle.
Factual Background
4At about 9pm on 29 June 2010 Daniel Forbes was walking with two friends when a red Commodore, in which the deceased and his younger brother were travelling as passengers, stopped and the deceased alighted. The deceased was aged 20 and his younger brother 19.   Daniel Forbes and his two friends were aged 18. They had been celebrating an 18th birthday and were considerably affected by alcohol.  One of his companions was punched by the deceased causing facial injuries which bled profusely. Mr Forbes was also assaulted.
5Mr Forbes and his friends ran from the scene to his home where he telephoned the applicant. The applicant was at that time aged 31.  The applicant then invited Mr Forbes and his friends to come to his home at Links Drive.  Except for Mr Forbes, they arrived armed with various weapons, including knives.  Mr Forbes was unarmed.
6The applicant permitted the young men to use his home as a base from which a retaliatory assault could be planned and launched. The applicant also arranged for his older brother, Chad Shedden, and another friend, Bradley White, to join them.  The applicant dispatched one of his friends to collect Bradley White.  He was overheard to say to his brother, ""Some of the young boys have been beaten up and they need our help"". 
7After Chad Shedden arrived he was seen by Mr Forbes to remove a shortened shotgun from his jacket. He was also seen to open the breech and remove and replace a cartridge. There was no evidence that the applicant was present when this occurred, or that he was otherwise aware that his brother was armed with a loaded firearm until it was discharged, killing the deceased some time later. He was, however, aware that one of the people who had grouped together in his house had a gun, having overheard someone on the telephone attempting to obtain another gun. It is conceded that he made no enquiries as to who had the gun or whether it was loaded.  
8As Bradley White was driven into Links Drive, the red Commodore also arrived.  Members of the applicant's group had by that time positioned themselves in various locations on the street from where they launched a surprise attack on the red Commodore using weapons of various kinds. None of the occupants of the red Commodore got out of the car. The applicant was armed with a metal rod which he threw, and which struck the back of the car.
9The red Commodore sped off pursued by Bradley White. There was no evidence of any contact between the two vehicles, or the occupants of the two vehicles, before Mr White returned to Links Drive where he regrouped with the applicant, his brother Chad Shedden, and the other young men. Still armed with weapons of various kinds they then moved around the area on foot looking for the red Commodore and its occupants.  They were unsuccessful and returned to Links Drive where they again concealed themselves in anticipation of the red Commodore returning.  At this time the applicant knew that the group was variously armed with metal rods, a hammer and knives in anticipation of a fresh confrontation with the occupants of the car.  The applicant continued to believe that one of the group had a gun.
10Meanwhile, the occupants of the red Commodore armed themselves and made their way back to Links Drive in a blue Commodore in substitution for the damaged red Commodore. On this occasion, the car was met at the corner of Links Drive and an intersecting street by someone who was dispatched to lure the car into the street for the purposes of being ambushed by those in the applicant's group. 
11As the blue Commodore drove into the street it was struck with broken pieces of paving bricks, causing the car to stop.  The applicant and those in his group then surrounded the car, striking it with the obvious intention of causing damage.
12The applicant was at the rear of the car brandishing a metal rod when the deceased emerged from the front passenger seat armed with a machete or knife of some kind and moved toward the rear of the car. He was heard to say, ""Who wants to get stabbed?""  As he approached the rear of the car, he was shot by Chad Shedden who was standing close to the applicant. Before the shot was fired, Chad Shedden was heard to tell the applicant to move out of the way.  He was heard to say to the deceased, ""Do you want to get shot? Do you want to get shot?""
13The deceased died on the way to the hospital from a single shotgun injury to the chest.
14Initially the applicant denied any involvement, when first spoken to by the police.  Later in a record of interview of 7 July 2010, following his arrest, the applicant directed the police to an area under the Irrawang Bridge on the north bank of the Hunter River where the shotgun that was used to kill the deceased was located by police divers the following day.  Within a short period of time, he nominated his brother as the shooter to the police.
15At the time the applicant provided this information, he had a well founded fear of retaliation by his brother and by other members of his family because of the assistance which he had provided to the police.  As a result, he has been in protective custody since the date of his arrest (7 July 2010), not only because of fears of retaliation from members of the family and friends of the deceased, but also from members of his own family.
Remarks on sentence
16In relation to the objective seriousness of the offence, her Honour said:
""24 I am satisfied that the offender played a principal role in the joint criminal enterprise in the course of which the deceased was shot and killed. Rather than counselling Daniel Forbes and his friends (very much younger men) against retaliation for the assault they suffered at the hands of the deceased, he recruited others to join with him for the specific purpose of mounting a retaliatory attack and then participated in that attack in the belief that one of the members of his group had a gun.  In addition, apparently not content with having damaged the red Commodore in the first attack, the offender was party to planning and launching a second armed attack after the blue Commodore was lured into Links Drive. While this does not constitute organised criminal activity as that concept is understood in s21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the assault was the subject of some planning, however amateurish. The offending is further aggravated by the complete disregard for public safety associated with a planned violent assault on a suburban street with the knowledge that one person was armed with a gun (s21A(2)(i)). Other aggravating factors under s21A(2) (including the use of a weapon and the offence being committed in company) have been taken into account in the assessment of the objective criminality of the joint criminal enterprise.

25 While I accept that the offender could not have known that the occupants of the blue Commodore would get out of the car, it was part of the planned attack that it would be stopped by missiles of various kinds being thrown at it. In those circumstances it was inevitable that there would be a physical confrontation between the two groups of men with a real risk of serious injury being inflicted given the offender's knowledge that members of his group were armed with knives and other makeshift weapons. Although the evidence does not establish that he knew that the gun in the possession of one of the men in his group was loaded until his brother and the deceased confronted one another and the gun was discharged, this does not diminish the objective seriousness of his criminal offending to any significant degree.""
17Because of the plea of guilty, and the assistance provided to the police, her Honour allowed a combined discount of 25 percent in favour of the applicant.
18The following subjective circumstances were taken into account.  The applicant had a criminal record with entries of violence as a juvenile and convictions for offences involving violence as an adult.  The most recent offence was possession of a knife with the intention to commit an indictable offence in 2008, which attracted a term of imprisonment of 18 months.
19The applicant did not call any evidence.  His subjective circumstances were addressed in submissions by his counsel.  It was not submitted that there were any factors in s21A which mitigated the objective seriousness of his offending.  
20In relation to parity, her Honour said:
""Parity
32 Daniel Forbes was sentenced by Harrison J for his role in the manslaughter of the deceased to imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months (see R v Forbes [2011] NSWSC 1547). 

33 The facts found by his Honour for sentencing purposes are materially different from the facts upon which this offender is to be sentenced.  His Honour found that Mr Forbes failed to appreciate the likelihood that the planned retaliatory attack would result in physical violence; that he was not armed at any time; that he had no opportunity to prevent the fatal shooting or withdraw from the enterprise even on the theoretical assumption that he was aware from what he had been told of what was likely to occur. His Honour also found that he was vulnerable to the influence of the offender and his brother as older men. In the result, his Honour was satisfied that Mr Forbes' criminality was at the lower end of the scale.

34 His Honour was also satisfied that leniency should be extended because of Mr Forbes' age, the fact that he had no criminal record and other favourable subjective circumstances. The sentence that might otherwise have been imposed was also discounted by 50 percent, representing the combined effect of an early plea of guilty and Mr Forbes' undertaking to give evidence against this offender and Chad Shedden.

35 In accordance with settled authority, the offender's counsel did not submit that the principles of parity applied in these circumstances.""
21When passing sentence, her Honour summarised the salient features of the applicant's offending as follows:
""38 In this case I am satisfied that the offender's role reflects a high degree of criminality which is untempered by any matters in mitigation. I am also satisfied that the nature of the joint criminal enterprise in which he apparently took a leading role was different in a range of respects from the circumstances frequently encountered in cases of manslaughter in this category.  While I am obliged to accept that the death of the deceased was not something that the offender contemplated, and that it was ultimately the result of a stand-off between two armed men, his conduct in planning and joining with others in an armed attack of the kind that was launched (and on two separate occasions on the one night in a suburban street), carried with it the risk of someone suffering serious injury. This must attract a sentence capable of deterring others from behaviour of the kind in which these two groups of men participated as well as punishing this offender and denouncing his conduct publicly.  ...""
Relevant findings in the sentence proceedings of Daniel Forbes - R v Forbes [2011] NSWSC 1547
22Mr Forbes was born in February 1992 and was aged 18 at the time of the offence.  He had been in regular employment and a large number of testimonials from people in many different walks of life were placed before the court.  He was found to be genuinely remorseful for his offending behaviour.  Although other persons in the group were armed, Mr Forbes was not.  
23In relation to mitigating factors, it was found in favour of Mr Forbes that the death of the deceased was not itself planned, organised or even discussed.  There was some provocation in terms of the assault on him.  He was a person of good character with no criminal convictions.  He was assessed as unlikely to re-offend and with excellent prospects of rehabilitation.  He received a 50 percent discount for his early plea and assistance to police.
24In addition, the following specific findings were made in his favour.
""As his group was leaving the house his intention was to ""punch on"" with the members of the opposing group"" [48].
""It is apparent that the offender neither armed himself with any weapon nor would he appear at any time up until when the deceased was killed to have taken any specific or particular act in furtherance of the enterprise beyond his limited organisation of his colleagues and his presence at the scene as a participant in it."" [49]
""There is as well the very troubling spectre of the role played in all these events by the Shedden brothers.  Each has a significant criminal history ...  Each was also in relative terms considerably older than the offender and other members of the Lakeside Crew.  It is clear that they were influential in what occurred."" [58]
""The relationship between the death of the deceased and the presence of the offender at the scene in this case is very little more than spatial and contemporaneous.  He did not contribute to the death of the deceased in any direct causal sense and he had no opportunity to prevent it or to withdraw from the enterprise on the theoretical assumption that he had been apprised of what was about to occur.""  [59]
""... the offender was inexperienced in life and unfamiliar with the potential consequences of violence. He was also naïve and gullible, and upon the basis of his uncontested record of interview, he was easily led."" [60]
The appeal
25A preliminary submission was made by the applicant to the effect that her Honour had incorrectly stated the concession made by his counsel when she said ""the offender's counsel did not submit that the principles of parity applied in these circumstances"".  The applicant submitted that the effect of what his counsel said was not that he should receive the same sentence, nor the same ""starting point sentence"" as Mr Forbes, but that it should still be taken into account as a ""touchstone"" in accordance with parity principles.
26I do not agree.  The relevant exchange is to be found at T.38.31 of the sentencing transcript.
""FITZGERALD:  The other matter that arose in your Honour's canvas of the Crown, before I move to my fresh matters, is that of the applicability of the sentence of Daniel Forbes.  I do not submit to the court that parity is something that the court would need to consider, but I do, in asking the court to view the penalty of Daniel Forbes as, if I may, a touchstone, insofar as there is some comparisons and some distinguishing features, it is conceded that my client is older than Daniel Forbes; my client, at the relevant time, was 31; I think, I stand to be corrected, Daniel Forbes was then 18.  My client has with him the life experience, and those life experiences include a criminal history such as it was, and I'll refer to that later if I may.""
27As I read that exchange, senior counsel was expressly eschewing reliance upon the parity principle, but did wish to make reference to the sentence imposed on Mr Forbes as providing some assistance to her Honour when sentencing the applicant.  Ultimately, however, that issue is not determinative.  It is open to the applicant with leave pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, to raise the issue.  If the parity principle was capable of being engaged in this matter, but was not and injustice resulted, the granting of leave would clearly be appropriate.
28Accordingly, I propose to deal with the matter on that basis.
29The applicant submitted that the parity principle plainly applied in this case.  This was because the principle applied to ""co-offenders"".  He relied upon the statement by the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462:
""29 ... The consistency required by the parity principle is focussed on the particular case. It applies to the punishment of ""co-offenders"", albeit the limits of that term have not been defined with precision.""
The applicant submitted that in this case there was no issue that the applicant and Mr Forbes were co-offenders.
30The applicant submitted that the application of the parity principle required a comparison of the seriousness of the offences committed by each co-offender and of the matters personal to each in the light of sentencing principles and guideposts.  When assessing relative offence seriousness, a particular co-offender's level of culpability was to be assessed by reference to the offender's particular conduct.  Differing personal history and matters ""subjective"" to each co-offender might justify different sentences, notwithstanding comparable offence seriousness.
31The applicant conceded that there were differences, particularly in terms of subjective circumstances between him and Mr Forbes.  The applicant submitted that the issue before this Court was whether those differences justified a starting point sentence for the applicant which was 12 years, i.e. 6 years longer than the starting point for Mr Forbes.  He submitted that they did not.
32The applicant submitted that because her Honour erred in failing to apply the parity principle when it clearly applied, the question for this Court was not whether it was ""open"" to her Honour to impose the sentence which she did but rather whether this Court, considering the issue for itself, regarded it as an appropriate application of the parity principle.
33The applicant submitted that a comparison of culpability and subjective considerations between the co-offenders made it clear that the parity principle had been breached by the applicant's sentence and that he had a justifiable sense of grievance.
34In relation to the offending, the applicant submitted that the level of culpability was equal.  Mr Forbes had ""gathered people together to assist him to respond by assaulting the deceased and his companions"".  By comparison, the applicant did not initiate the joint criminal enterprise but rather recruited others to join with him for the specific purpose of mounting a retaliatory attack.  The disregard of public safety associated with a planned assault on a suburban street was relevant to the offending of both.
35The applicant submitted that his knowledge in relation to the firearm and that of Mr Forbes was similar.  Mr Forbes knew that Chad Shedden had a shotgun and saw him load it, whereas the applicant was told that a participant in the joint criminal enterprise had a firearm but he did not know who, nor did he know whether it was loaded.  
36The applicant accepted that in relation to subjective circumstances, there was a significant difference between those of Mr Forbes and his.  Mr Forbes was 18, did not have a criminal record and was found to be a person of good character with excellent prospects of rehabilitation.  He had also expressed remorse.  The applicant accepted that he had a criminal record with entries for violence and convictions for offences involving violence as an adult.  There was no evidence of remorse.
37The applicant submitted that the result of such a comparison made it clear that his sense of grievance was justified in that the differences between him and Mr Forbes, by reference to culpability and personal circumstances, simply did not justify such a disparity in sentences.
Consideration
38It is not accurate to say that her Honour erred in failing to apply the parity principle.  It is clear from the way in which her Honour dealt with it (see [20] hereof) that her Honour implicitly accepted that the principle applied otherwise there was no purpose in her setting out what she regarded as the significant distinguishing features between Mr Forbes and the applicant.  What her Honour was really saying in a shorthand way, was that when one carried out the comparison of culpability and personal circumstances, which the application of the parity principle required, the end result was that there was no basis for any justified sense of grievance on the part of the applicant.   The question for this Court is whether it was open to her to reach that conclusion.
39I do not agree that the culpability of the applicant and Mr Forbes was the same.  The participation of Mr Forbes in the joint criminal enterprise was very much as a follower under the direction of the applicant and his brother.  The applicant actively recruited participants in the joint criminal enterprise and adopted a leadership role.  The applicant played a part in planning and launching the two attacks on the car in which the deceased was travelling.  This is to be contrasted with the position of Mr Forbes who was found to be naive, gullible and easily led.  The applicant was armed but Mr Forbes was not.  
40In the particular circumstances of this offence, the difference in ages is important.  The applicant was 31 and Mr Forbes was 18.  Not only did the applicant have more life experience, but that experience extended to crimes of violence which included the possession if not the use of a weapon.  Mr Forbes had no such experience and was clearly dominated by the applicant and his brother.
41As her Honour found, the applicant instead of using his age and greater experience to counsel his younger companions, including Mr Forbes, used it to encourage their participation in the joint criminal enterprise in which he had a principal role. 
42As the applicant properly conceded, a comparison of their personal characteristics significantly favoured Mr Forbes.  Mr Forbes had the advantage of good character without any criminal antecedents, remorse and excellent prospects of rehabilitation.
43These were the very differences which the plurality in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen identified as justifying a significant disparity in sentences:
""31 ...  The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.""
44Her Honour found, in effect, that it was the profound differences between the culpability and personal circumstances of the applicant and Mr Forbes that reduced the principle of parity to a point of virtual irrelevance.  Not only was it open to her Honour to find that the parity principle did not apply in the sense that there was no basis for a justified sense of grievance on the part of the applicant but had it been necessary to consider these matters for myself I would have reached the same conclusion.
45The orders which I propose are:
(1) Leave to appeal be granted.
(2) Appeal dismissed.
46BELLEW J:   I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
47BARR AJ:   I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		09 October 2013",2013-10-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706024,Cameron v R [2013] NSWCCA 224,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offence and sentenceOn 23 June 2012 the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence (destroy property by fire), contrary to s112(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900, committed on 25 February 2012.  The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 14 years.
2On 27 November 2012 the applicant was sentenced by Payne DCJ to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing 25 February 2012 and expiring 24 February 2015, with a balance of term of 1 year and 10 months, expiring 24 December 2016.
3The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence as follows:
Ground 1:  Her Honour failed to reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence due to the applicant's depression.
Ground 2:  Her Honour's finding that there was ""a considerable element of planning"" was not open to her, and undermined her Honour's finding as to the ""disinhibiting effect"" of alcohol upon the applicant.
Factual Background
4The applicant was born in 1958.  His family owned several farming properties in the Tamworth area.  The properties were run as a partnership until 1984 when the applicant left after receiving a large amount of money.
5The applicant moved interstate before returning to Tamworth in about 1997 where he was employed by the family partnership as a farmhand.  After the death of the applicant's father, the properties were administered by the applicant's brother, David, and his wife.
6Since about 2005 the applicant increased the amount of alcohol which he was drinking.  By early 2012, he had not been working properly and was often intoxicated or badly hung over when at work.  As a result, David terminated his employment as a farmhand on 4 January.  Since that time, the applicant continued to reside on the family properties and was provided with food etc by the partnership.  As the applicant did not have a driver's licence, he would be driven into town when necessary by David's wife.
7In February 2012 the applicant was living on one of the family partnership properties called ""Glenore"" with his mother.  David, his wife and their three children lived on another of the partnership properties called ""Ferntop"".  The two properties were separated by several properties, all of which were owned by the family partnership.  Access to the houses on the properties could be gained through internal gates without having to traverse public roads.
8At about 11am on 24 February 2012, David's wife drove the applicant to the home of Paul Herden in Calala.  From that time until about 8pm, the applicant and Mr Herden consumed a quantity of beer.  On 25 February the applicant commenced drinking alcohol at about 7am.  At 12.30pm Mr Herden drove the applicant to the ""Glenore"" property and the applicant purchased a carton of beer on the way.
9At about 1.30pm on 25 February David, his wife and their children left ""Ferntop"" towing a recently purchased motor boat intending to go to the local dam for the afternoon.  They went to the house at ""Glenore"" to fill the boat with petrol.  As they were leaving, they encountered the applicant and Mr Herden and a confrontation took place.  The applicant got out of Mr Herden's car and said ""Who owns this fucking boat?  Who paid for it?""  His brother told him he did not need to know and the applicant said ""You two can go to hell.  Get off this fucking property"".  There was some further conversation of a similar kind culminating in the applicant's brother driving away.  
10At about 2pm, the applicant called his brother's mobile telephone but there was no answer.  The applicant then went inside the house at ""Glenore"", drank some more beer and had a short sleep.  When he awoke he made several telephone calls and left a message for his brother and sister-in-law saying ""You'll be sorry you didn't answer this call"".
11The applicant then went to a shed, obtained a container of petrol, put it on a quad bike and drove to his brother's house ""Ferntop"", through the paddocks of the adjoining properties.  Once at ""Ferntop"", the applicant knowing the keys would be in it, went to a ute parked in the carport and removed those keys.  He then went to the back door where he called out to see whether anybody was home.  Receiving no response, the applicant opened the back door of the house and went inside with the container of petrol.
12Once inside the house, the applicant again called out to see if anybody was home and receiving no response, went to the main bedroom where he poured petrol on the bed.  He then went to the family room where he poured a further amount of petrol around the room.  He then lit the petrol in the family room and left the house, locking the back door and putting the keys back in the ute where he had found them.
13The applicant rode the quad bike back to ""Glenore"", went inside the house, got a beer and made some telephone calls.  Between 2.30 and 3pm Mr Herden received a telephone call from the applicant.  He later told police that the applicant sounded very intoxicated, distressed and was rambling.  During the conversation the applicant said ""I'm going to gaol"".  Shortly afterwards, the applicant rang again and told Mr Herden ""I burnt David's house down"".  Mrs Herden called triple O and reported what she had been told.  She then called the Tamworth Police.  The applicant also rang triple O on two or three occasions.
14At 5.45pm two police officers went to ""Glenore"" where they found the applicant who was crying.  He said repeatedly ""I've done something terrible"".  The applicant was holding a bottle of beer and smelled of alcohol.  The applicant said ""I did something terribly wrong sir, I burnt my brother's house down, I just want to die, I can't do this anymore"".  The applicant said he did not know whether his brother was still in the house or not.
15The two police officers took the applicant to ""Ferntop"" where they observed the house to be on fire and that the fire brigade was in attendance.  The applicant said ""I told you sir that I done it"".
16The applicant was taken to Tamworth Police Station and formally interviewed.  The applicant described his level of intoxication to the police as ""okay to drive but about 3 or 4 on a sale of 1 - 10 of intoxication"".  The house was severely damaged by the fire and the estimate of the cost of repairs was $296,000.  The contents of the house were totally destroyed and their value was estimated to be in excess of $80,000.
Sentence proceedings
17The Crown submitted that there were aggravating features associated with the offence.  It submitted that the fact that the victim and his family were also members of the applicant's family, made the offence more serious.  The Crown submitted that because the house was part of a rural property, which was isolated, the response time for the fire brigade was longer.  The Crown also emphasised that being a weekend, the children's schoolbooks and school belongings were lost in the fire.  The Crown noted that all family keepsakes, trophies, photographs and personal belongings had also been destroyed.  The Crown submitted that these were important matters, despite the fact that no-one had suffered any physical injury as a result of the fire.
18Counsel for the applicant accepted that there was some planning involved in the offence.  She also accepted that he was fully aware of his actions, but that it was a matter for the Court to determine the extent of his ability to make sensible and reasoned decisions and the extent to which that was affected because of his depression.
19In evidence, the applicant said that he had been depressed but qualified the contents of a psychological report which was tendered in his case by saying that he did not try to kill himself before the offending.  He said that he was certainly thinking about it and had taken certain actions but then did not go through with them.
20The thrust of the applicant's case was that at the time the offence occurred and for some time previously, he had been severely depressed.  Counsel for the applicant submitted that this was a significant matter in favour of the applicant, when the Court came to consider moral culpability and general deterrence.  Counsel also referred to the effect of the alcohol which had been consumed by the applicant before the offence.
Remarks on sentence
21Her Honour accepted the opinion of a psychologist that at the time when he committed the offence, the applicant was clinically depressed.  She accepted that this depression had some impact on his moral culpability and said:
"" ... I certainly take it into account in that way but there is no evidence that this behaviour was other than purposeful and indeed there was an element - indeed quite a considerable element of planning.""  (ROS 8.9)
22Her Honour particularised the element of planning.  She noted that the applicant had telephoned his brother's wife and left a message.  Her Honour said:
""He then had to leave his home, go and get the petrol, put it into a can or top it up, put that on the front of the quad bike, get onto the quad bike, drive the quad bike for a distance of in the order of 15 minutes or so through paddocks that would have involved the opening and shutting of something in the order of three to four gates, got to the house, had to get into the enclosed yard, went to the motor vehicle and got the keys out of the ignition, then went into the house and then spread the petrol, then went back out of the house and returned the keys to the vehicle. ...  but as the Crown emphasises, that is quite purposeful behaviour involving, as it did, a number of steps, at any point in which he could have changed his mind and not continued.""  (ROS 7.7)
23In relation to the effect of his depression on the offending, her Honour said:
""I have already said that in the circumstances of this case I give weight to it in terms of an impact in his favour in relation to moral culpability.  It is also a subjective consideration but, as the Crown said, it cannot be given great weight and nor should general deterrence be completely put to one side in this case and I accept the Crown's submission.  Equally, he was affected by alcohol at the time and I accept that this would have had a disinhibiting effect on him.
In that connection, the Crown said there was no issue that he was depressed but as I have noted the Crown said, and I accept, that this should have a limited effect in the circumstances of this case on the requirement for general deterrence and he was, as is clear from the steps that I have just stated, functioning quite well.""  (ROS 9.3)
24By reference to the message which he left for his sister-in-law, her Honour concluded that anger and resentment which he felt in relation to his brother and sister-in-law, resulting from matters that he perceived or he was aggrieved by, formed a part of his motivation for committing the offence.  This was no doubt a reference to that part of the psychologist's report (p 9) which said:
""It appears his action was triggered when he met his brother and sister-in-law leaving the property earlier that day, towing a new speed boat.  John was angered as he had recently asked his brother who has owned the family property outright since their father's death seven years ago, to pay for necessary improvements for his mother's home for her safety and wellbeing and David refused.  This occurred against a background of other irritants over the family company and finances, including John's salary situation, his recent dismissal by his brother, consequent lack of employment and his lack of financial security compared to his brother.""
25In relation to the applicant's subjective case, her Honour noted that the applicant would shortly turn 54 and had never previously been in fulltime custody.  There had been some minor previous offences, but nothing as serious as this offence.  His criminal record indicated continuing difficulties with alcohol abuse.  There were three separate offences of driving affected by alcohol.
26Her Honour found that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation.  She also found that he showed general contrition and remorse for his offending and that he was to be given credit for volunteering the information which he did to police and in the triple O call.  He was entitled to a 25 percent discount for his early plea of guilty.
Ground of Appeal 1:
27The applicant submitted that consistently with her Honour's finding that the applicant suffered from depression at the time of the offence, her Honour should have found that this effectively eliminated the significance of specific deterrence, or at least reduced it significantly, in the sentencing process.  He submitted that her Honour's failure to take this matter into account was an error and that this Court should intervene to re-sentence.
28This ground of appeal has not been made out.  Her Honour took into account the applicant's depression when considering his moral culpability and general deterrence.  Those findings favoured the applicant, although they were qualified by her Honour's finding as to the extent of the planning and that the applicant was fully aware of his actions.
29In some cases, a failure by a sentencing judge to refer to a principle may be taken as indicating that the Judge did not take that matter into account.  In other cases, it may be clear from the reasoning that although no reference is made to the principle, it was in fact taken into account.
30In this case, her Honour made no reference to the applicability or otherwise of specific deterrence.  From that and from the general tone of her Honour's remarks on sentence, I infer that her Honour did not consider specific deterrence had any relevance to the matter before her.  If that be so, she was certainly justified in reaching that conclusion.
31The evidence was overwhelmingly to the effect that the applicant was remorseful for what he had done and was somewhat shocked by the devastating consequences of his actions.  There was no suggestion anywhere in the evidence that he would ever contemplate committing such an offence again.
32Even if that were not implicitly part of her Honour's reasoning, the fact that her Honour did not refer to specific deterrence allows an inference to be drawn that her Honour did not take it into account as a consideration which would operate unfavourably for the applicant.  Accordingly, there was no basis for a submission that her Honour's failure to mention specific deterrence operated unfavourably for the applicant.
Ground of Appeal 2:
33The applicant submitted that her Honour had incorrectly characterised his actions leading up to the offending as involving ""a considerable element of planning"".  The applicant submitted that a more appropriate characterisation was that his actions were spontaneous in circumstances of severe depression and affectation by alcohol.
34I do not agree.  It is tolerably clear that at least from the time when the applicant telephoned his sister-in-law, he had formed an intention to break and enter ""Ferntop"" and set fire to the house.  Thereafter, as her Honour particularised, he took a number of purposeful and methodical steps over a reasonably significant amount of time, i.e. well in excess of the 15 minutes it would have taken him to travel from ""Glenore"" to ""Ferntop"".  Ultimately he achieved the task which he had set himself, i.e. to break into and burn down the home of his brother and his family.  It is difficult to see how that sequence of events could be appropriately characterised as involving ""spontaneous"" conduct on his part.
35As was conceded by the applicant in the sentencing proceedings, there was an element of planning involved in the offence.  It is apparent from the applicant's actions and his interview with the police, that he was fully aware of his actions.  Against that background and having considered the actions taken by the applicant leading up to the offence, it was well open to her Honour to make the finding that there was ""a considerable element of planning"".
36This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Conclusion
37The orders which I propose are as follows:
(1) Leave to appeal granted.
(2) The appeal is dismissed.
38BELLEW J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		09 October 2013",2013-10-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706028,Police v Horsfield; Police v Dowd [2013] NSWLC 17,"Judgment

1On 9 September 2013 I delivered a judgment in which I excluded under s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 all of the prosecution evidence relied upon to support the charges brought against the two accused. Both accused through their respective counsel made applications for costs orders under the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

2Mr Dowd was represented by Mr Pierce of counsel who was, as I understand it, engaged through the Legal Aid Commission. Mr Horsfield was represented by Mr Boland of counsel, who had been engaged through the Principal solicitor of the Aboriginal Legal Service (the ALS). I was told that both Mr Pierce and Mr Boland practise as private barristers at the NSW Bar. Mr Pierce handed up to me his memoranda of fees which he indicated related to his conduct of the proceedings on behalf of his client.

3Mr Boland was not in a position to hand up his memoranda of fees at that time and made submissions about the amount that was claimed. Upon the making of the costs applications, the police prosecutor handed up a document described as a decision of my brother magistrate, Dunlevy LCM, in a matter of Police v Turley (unreported, 25 July 2013). The police prosecutor relied upon that decision to resist the costs application brought on behalf of Mr Boland's client. When the document was handed up to me, I noted that it appeared to be typed notes of his Honour's decision rather than the full judgment. From the notes that were handed up of the decision, it appeared his Honour held that as, on the evidence before him, the successful accused was represented by the Aboriginal Legal Service and was not required to pay legal fees to that service, any costs application must fail.

4I adjourned the matter to the following Friday, 13 September 2013, to allow the parties to put before me a copy of his Honour's judgment together with any evidence that they wished to tender on the costs application, and any further submissions. I received from Mr Boland his memoranda of fees for appearing in the proceedings. I was not provided with any evidence or information about the nature of the retainer that the ALS had with Mr Horsfield. Nor was I provided with any evidence about the nature of the ALS organisation. Due to my other hearings that day, I was only in position to hear brief oral submissions from the parties and adjourned the matter until today. I did indicate that the parties were at liberty if they wished to forward further written submissions. I did receive written submissions from Mr Boland.

5No submissions have been made on behalf of the Police in response to the application for costs brought on behalf of Mr Dowd. The only basis of the opposition to the application for costs brought on behalf of Mr Horsfield has been that he was represented by the ALS, relying upon Dunlevy LCM's decision in Turley.

The statutory provisions
6Section 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides as follows:
(1) A court may at the end of summary proceedings order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court, for payment to the accused person, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn. 
(2) The amount of professional costs is to be the amount that the Magistrate considers to be just and reasonable. 
(3) Without limiting the operation of subsection (1), a court may order that the prosecutor in summary proceedings pay professional costs if the matter is dismissed because: 
(a) the prosecutor fails to appear or both the prosecutor and the accused person fail to appear, or 
(b) the matter is withdrawn or the proceedings are for any reason invalid. 
(5) The order must specify the amount of professional costs payable

7""Professional costs"" are defined in s 211 of the Criminal Procedure Act as follows:

In this Part: ""professional costs"" means costs (other than court costs) relating to professional expenses and disbursements (including witnesses' expenses) in respect of proceedings before a court.

8Section 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides a definition of the term ""accused person"" and is in the following terms:

(1) In this Act, except in so far as the context or subject-matter otherwise indicates or requires: ""accused person"" includes, in relation to summary offences, a defendant and, in relation to all offences (where the subject-matter or context allows or requires), an Australian legal practitioner representing an accused person.

9Section 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides in effect a fetter on the court's discretion to award costs to a successful defendant in summary criminal proceedings. The section was introduced to overcome the majority decision in Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534. The section relevantly provides as follows:

(1) Professional costs are not to be awarded in favour of an accused person in summary proceedings unless the court is satisfied as to any one or more of the following: 
(a) that the investigation into the alleged offence was conducted in an unreasonable or improper manner, 
(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause or in bad faith or were conducted by the prosecutor in an improper manner, 
(c) that the prosecutor unreasonably failed to investigate (or to investigate properly) any relevant matter of which it was aware or ought reasonably to have been aware and which suggested either that the accused person might not be guilty or that, for any other reason, the proceedings should not have been brought, 
(d) that, because of other exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings by the prosecutor, it is just and reasonable to award professional costs. 
(2) This section does not apply to the awarding of costs against a prosecutor acting in a private capacity. 

Relevant Cases and submissions

10Although the parties were not able to provide me with a copy of Dunlevy LCM's actual judgment, I have since been able to obtain a copy. It appears from a reading of his Honour's judgment that his Honour was provided with some evidence, or there was some agreement between the parties, as to the legal nature of the ALS, and also the nature of its retainer with its clients in criminal proceedings, and in particular with the retainer that was in place with the successful defendant in the proceedings before his Honour.

11No such evidence or agreement was put before me. I do not have any evidence as to the nature of the retainer between Mr Horsfield and the ALS. I also note that there is no suggestion in his Honour's judgment that the ALS had, in the proceedings before him, engaged private counsel.

12Dunlevy LCM held that the reference to an ""accused"" in s 213 could not be construed as including a reference to the ALS or an Australian legal practitioner employed by the ALS. His Honour was of the view that the provision was drafted ""with a more traditional view towards the method by which solicitors are engaged, and in particular a method of engagement whereby a solicitor is retained by a client whom then signs a costs agreement where it is envisaged that invoices will ultimately issue to the accused person. It is also drafted seemingly by reference to the traditional practise where solicitors instruct counsel and thus incur disbursements...""

13His Honour noted in his judgment that there is a specific provision of the Legal Aid Commission Act concerned with applications for costs by legally aided persons. This was an apparent reference to s 42 of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1979. His Honour considered that the existence of such a provision suggested ""the fundamental starting point is that an organisation providing legal services to a party who is not obliged to pay them is not in the ordinary course entitled to apply for costs"".

14His Honour was also of the opinion that the purpose behind the award of costs was ""to indemnify a successful party against losses that they have incurred as a result of having to pay legal fees"". On the evidence before his Honour, Mr Turley was not liable to pay any legal costs to the ALS and so there was nothing to indemnify him for, hence no order for costs could be made.

15Mr Boland of counsel stated that Dunlevy LCM's decision was in error and was inconsistent with a decision of Justice Templeman of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in Bolton v Stange [2001] WASCA 34. 

16Bolton v Stange was an appeal from a decision of a Western Australian Magistrate not to award costs in favour of a successful defendant in summary criminal proceedings in Western Australia. The appellant in that case had been represented by the ALS before the Magistrate, and at the end of the proceedings the ALS solicitor had made an application for costs. In the course of the costs application the Magistrate had said, ""Your funding comes from the government. I see it as a fruitless exercise to tell the government to take money out of one pocket and put it in another"". In his reasons for rejecting the costs application the Magistrate said; ""The complaint is dismissed and as to costs I do not believe in the circumstances that an order is warranted. This is a shorthand way of pursuing my previous practice. Until someone tells me it is wrong, it is a practice I intend to follow"".

17Templeman J referred to the relevant Western Australian legislative provisions and observed that the Magistrate had a discretion as to costs. Templeman J noted that the accused's retainer in that case was governed by cl 42 of the constitution of the Aboriginal Legal Service of WA Inc. His Honour at [6] said; 

Clause 42 provides that costs incurred by the association in the provision of legal assistance are deemed to be costs incurred by the applicant for that assistance, for the purpose of any application for an order for costs. However, this point did not arise in the present case, because the learned Magistrate did not decline to make an order for costs on the basis that the costs were not due and payable. 

[7] Indeed, it would not have been open to the learned Magistrate to inquire into the relationship between the appellant and his legal representative. That is because there is a deemed retainer in the absence of proof of any express agreement that costs will not be paid. In other words, if an accused person is represented by a legal practitioner - from the Aboriginal Legal Service or anywhere else- the Court must assume that the relationship of solicitor and client exists between them with a consequential obligation to pay such costs as may be due.

18Templeman J in making the observations in [6] and [7] of his judgment relied upon Hudgson v Endrust (Australia) Pty Ltd (1986) 11 FCR 152. Pincus J in Hudgson expressed the opinion that a ""court will hold, in the absence of proof of an express agreement to the contrary, that a solicitor who acts upon instructions for a party on the record is taken to be entitled to look at that party for costs, even if the instructions have come to the solicitor from another party or from some non-party interested in the litigation. The doctrine is one of a deemed retainer"". Pincus J makes clear that there is an onus on the party seeking to challenge the nature of the retainer.

19Pincus J's approach was considered by Campbell J in Hawksford v Hawksford [2005] NSWSC 463 in particular at [46] to [49]. The approach of Campbell J in Hawksford was consistent with the approach of Pincus J in Hudgson.

20Resolution of the issue concerning whether or not a person represented by the ALS is able to bring a costs application under s 213 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

21I set out earlier the observations of Templeman J in Bolton v Stange. The approach his Honour there took to the issue of the nature of the retainer of an accused is consistent with that taken by Pincus J and Campbell J in the context of civil litigation. 

22As I understand that approach, the Court is to assume, absent evidence to the contrary, that there is a retainer between the solicitor concerned and the accused, and that the solicitor concerned may look to the accused for payment of the accused's costs. The party that seeks to challenge the nature of the solicitor's retainer bears the onus of proving that the nature of the retainer is not consistent with the assumption that is referred to in the cases I have reviewed.

23As I noted earlier in this judgment, I have no evidence concerning the nature of the retainer between Mr Horsfield and the ALS. I do know from what I was told by Mr Boland, and from his tax invoice that is before me on the costs application, that he is a private counsel instructed by the Principal Solicitor with the ALS, and looks to that service for the payment of his fees. What I do not know is the nature of the retainer Mr Horsfield had with the ALS.

24Consistent with the authorities I have referred to, the Police bore the onus of adducing evidence to overcome the assumption about the nature of the retainer between Mr Horsfield and the ALS. That onus was not discharged here as the Police adduced no evidence as to the nature of that retainer despite being given an opportunity to do so. I do not think I can simply assume, absent evidence, that the nature of the retainer that Dunlevy LCM found existed between the ALS and Mr Turley, was the same as that which existed between Mr Horsfield and the ALS. For one thing, counsel was briefed in Mr Horsfield's matter and not in Mr Turley's matter. For all I know, the ALS may approach the representation of clients and their retainers on an individual basis, especially where a decision is made to engage private counsel to appear for an accused.

25For these reasons, I reject the Police submission that because Mr Horsfield was represented by the ALS, his application for costs should be refused. In my opinion Mr Horsfield was an ""accused"" person within the meaning of that term as defined in the Criminal Procedure Act. He was entitled to bring an application for costs through his counsel, under s 213.

26It will be apparent that I have decided this issue on a rather narrow basis. In deference to the submissions that were advanced, and the arguably important issue raised, given the frequency with which the ALS appears in the Local Court, I propose to say a little more in relation to the submissions that were advanced.

27Mr Boland referred to Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534. In particular he referred to the following passage in Mason CJ's judgment at 543:

The availability of legal aid might be regarded as a possible reason for refusing to award costs. But no court can assume that a particular defendant is entitled to, or is in receipt of, legal aid and it would not be right to draw a distinction between defendants based on receipt of legal aid. In any event, courts have traditionally made orders for costs without regard to considerations of that kind.

28In my opinion Mason CJ's views are consistent with the cases I have referred to above in relation to the Court not assuming that a person is not required to be responsible for the payment of a lawyer's fees. His Honour's comments, which were clearly obiter, do however go further and suggest that the fact a person is a legally aided person is not a bar to bringing a costs application as a matter of principle. I note, however, I have no evidence before me that Mr Horsfield, who was represented by the ALS, had entered a similar or identical retainer to a legally aided accused.

29The majority of the High Court in Latoudis v Casey expressed the opinion that in both criminal and civil proceedings costs are not awarded by way of punishment of the unsuccessful party. They are awarded to indemnify the successful party against the expense to which that party has been put by reason of the legal proceedings; see Mason CJ at 543,Toohey J at 562-563, and McHugh J at 567.

30Latoudis v Casey was decided prior to the introduction of s 81A of the Justices Act 1902, which was the forerunner of s 214 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Given what is required to be found in order to make an order for costs against a prosecutor not acting in a private capacity under s 214, there may well be an argument that awards of costs under the Criminal Procedure Act against a prosecutor are not solely to indemnify a successful party. That is because there might be said to be an element of fault contained in the sub-paragraphs of s 214(1). It is unnecessary in the circumstances for me to come to a final conclusion in relation to that issue.

31Wentworth v Rogers (2006) 66 NSWLR 474 was referred to both before Dunlevy LCM and in the proceedings before me. At the outset it should be noted the case arose out of long running civil litigation. In the Court of Appeal both Santow JA and Basten JA made observations concerning the indemnity principle in relation to the awarding of costs.

32Latoudis v Casey, putting to one side the possible argument I have referred to above, makes clear that the indemnity principle applies in relation to the awarding of costs in criminal proceedings. 

33In relation to the indemnity principle Santow JA in Wentworth v Rogers said:

[45] The indemnity principle is long-established at general law. It is however not to be applied rigidly, or uninfluenced by statute or by practice recognised by statute, such as in relation to conditional fee agreements. I do not agree with the amicus' submissions that the principle has ceased to exist. Certainly there have been inroads to it brought about by the Act and by analogical reasoning from recognised exceptions. Where a party to an action has an agreement with their legal adviser that they do not have to pay any costs, then the general law principle states that that party cannot recover party and party costs against their adversary: McCullum v Ifield [1969] 2 NSWR 329 at 330 per Taylor J citing Gundry v Sainsbury [1910] 1 KB 645.
...

[50] First, the indemnity principle is not immutable, and should be applied flexibly rather than made into a rigid rule, as the examples given by Basten JA demonstrate. This was said as long ago as 1902 by Walker J in New Pinnacle Group Silver Mining Co v Luhrig Coal and Ore Dressing Appliances Co (1902) 2 SR(NSW) 50.

34Basten JA did not agree that the indemnity principle was to be applied ""flexibly and reasonably""; see [161]. His Honour said the following :

[102] The substantive issue at the heart of the Appellants' case was the principle that the fundamental purpose of an order that one party to litigation pay the legal expenses or 'costs' of another party is to provide an indemnity in relation to the whole, or usually part, of the legal obligation incurred by the other party to his or her lawyers. If that party is under no legal obligation to pay lawyers' fees, no amount can be recovered from the unsuccessful party. This principle, sometimes known as the indemnity principle, was explained in Gundry v Sainsbury [1910] 1 KB 645. 

[103] The principle does not apply only to the case in which the party has no financial obligation at all to his or her lawyer. It must also operate in the case where the lawyer has agreed to appear at a reduced fee, below that which might, in the ordinary course, be recoverable or has agreed to appear without fee, but on the basis that he or she would be reimbursed for disbursements, such as filing fees or travel expenses. In some cases an agreement with a solicitor to pay disbursements might include counsel's fees. However, that would seem not to be this case, in which counsel were engaged, without an instructing solicitor, well before the solicitor, Mr Licardy, agreed to act. 

[104] The indemnity principle has been held to operate in two circumstances which might not obviously fall within its terms. The first is where the lawyers will be paid for their services, but not, as a matter of practice, by the client. Examples of that situation include cases where the litigant is indemnified by an insurer, by an association, such as a trade union, of which the litigant is a member, or where legal aid is obtained: see, eg, R v Archbishop of Canterbury [1903] 1 KB 289; Adams v London Improved Motor Coach Builders Ltd [1921] 1 KB 495; Electrical Trade Unions v Tarlo [1964] Ch 720 and Johnson v Santa Teresa Housing Association (1992) 83 NTR 14. In each case, the primary liability was held to be that of the litigant or client and hence the indemnity principle was satisfied. In other circumstances, a lawyer may be employed by the litigant, either a trading corporation or some similar body, or the Crown. In such cases it has again been accepted that the litigant incurs costs, although questions may arise as to the amount which can be recovered: see, eg, Backhouse v Judd [1925] SASR 395; Davies v Taylor [No. 2] [1974] AC 225 at 234 (Lord Cross of Chelsea) and Joyce v Kammac Ltd [1996] 1 All ER 923 at 928.

35Hislop JA found it unnecessary to express a view about the difference in the approaches by Basten JA and Santow JA; see [216].

36Absent evidence as to the legal status of the ALS and details of its retainer with Mr Horsfield, I am unable to determine if his engagement of the ALS falls within one of the exceptions referred to in the judgments of Santow JA and Basten JA. For the reasons I gave earlier, it is not necessary that I do so.

37It may be that in an appropriate case the following observations of Napier J, with whom Angas Parsons J agreed, in Lenthall v Hillson [1933] SASR 31 at 36 will be of particular importance: ""We think that the principle that costs are given as an indemnity can be carried too far. It comes from the unwritten law, and depends upon considerations of public policy and convenience, and it follows that it must be reasonably understood and applied"".

38Dunlevy LCM in the Police v Turley, on the basis of the evidence before his Honour, determined that the engagement of the ALS by Mr Turley did not fall within one of the exceptions identified in Wentworth v Rogers. It is unnecessary for me to express any opinion about his Honour's conclusion as I do not know if Mr Horsfield's engagement of the ALS was on the same terms as Mr Turley's.

39Section 42 of the Legal Aid Commission Act was referred to by Mr Boland in these proceedings. It seems likely that is the provision that Dunlevy LCM had in mind when his Honour gave judgment in Turley. Section 42 provides:

A court or tribunal which may order the payment of costs in proceedings before it shall, where a legally assisted person is a party to any such proceedings, make an order as to costs in respect of the legally assisted person as if he or she were not a legally assisted person.

40I think it unlikely that the presence of s 42 of the Legal Aid Commission Act sheds any light on the position in relation to persons who are represented by the ALS. Both Latoudis v Casey and Wentworth v Rogers suggest that the Courts have considered persons represented by the legal aid bodies to be an exception to the indemnity principle, without reference to any particular statutory provision. There appears to be nothing in the second reading speech relating to the introduction of the Legal Aid Commission Act 1979 to suggest that s 42 was introduced to carve out an exception to the indemnity principle. As the quotes from Napier J and Santow JA above suggest, the category of exceptions to the indemnity principle determined by the higher courts may change over time.

The criteria in s 214(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 

41No submission was advanced on behalf of the Police that the criteria set out in s 214(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act were not made out. My decision on the voir dire to exclude all of the prosecution evidence was on the basis of illegality, in that I determined that the Officer in Charge, Sergeant Abbott, had at least recklessly and probably deliberately, forced entry into domestic premises without a lawful basis. I also rejected a great deal of the evidence given by Abbott as to his asserted reasons for entering the premises.

42The findings I made on the voir dire in my opinion satisfy the requirements of s 214(1)(a), in that I am satisfied that the investigation into the alleged offences was conducted unreasonably and in an improper manner. I am also of the opinion that my findings satisfy the requirements of s 214(1)(b) that the proceedings were initiated without reasonable cause. That is because, as my findings on the voir dire indicate, but for the illegal entry to the premises, the conduct alleged to have given rise to the offences charged would not have occurred. 

The issue of just and reasonable costs

43No submission was advanced on behalf of the Police that the costs sought by Mr Boland on behalf of Mr Horsfield, or the costs sought by Mr Pierce on behalf of Mr Dowd were not just and reasonable.

44Mr Pierce claimed an amount of $14,850 for all appearances, including mentions of the proceedings and preparation and hearing time. Some of that work was done by a solicitor and the preparation and hearing work was attended to by Mr Pierce without the presence of an instructing solicitor. His daily appearance rate for appearing at the hearing days, without the assistance of an instructing solicitor, was $2,500 exclusive of GST. The voir dire hearing was one requiring considerable preparation. There is nothing about the amount claimed that appears to me not to be just and reasonable.

45Mr Boland claimed an amount of $19,525. As with Mr Pierce, some of the work claimed was performed by a solicitor. Mr Boland appeared on the hearing days without the assistance of an instructing solicitor. His daily fee for the hearing days was the same as Mr Pierce. The claimed costs are slightly greater than those claimed on behalf of Mr Dowd, but that is explained by the additional work Mr Boland was required to undertake on the issue that was raised on the costs application. There is nothing about the costs claimed on behalf of Mr Horsfield that appears to me not to be just and reasonable.

Orders

46In light of the above reasons I make the following orders:

The prosecutor in the matter of Nathan Dowd is to pay to the registrar for payment to the Legal Aid Commission on behalf of the accused the amount of $14,850 by way of professional costs.

The prosecutor in the matter of Tyron Horsfield is to pay to the registrar for payment to the ALS on behalf of the accused the amount of $19,525 by way of professional costs.

		15 January 2014",2013-10-09 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2706029,LT v RT [2013] NSWDC 251,"Judgment


Introduction


1The plaintiff claims damages from the defendant who is her father arising from his committing serious sexual assaults against her from the time she was four or five years old until the time she was 13 years old. He has admitted his guilt to a series of charges preferred against him and is now in gaol following a sentence of imprisonment passed upon him earlier this year by another Judge of the District Court of New South Wales.

2The plaintiff is an attractive, though fragile and distressed woman of 54 years. The Statement of Claim rolls up all the sexual assaults in a single cause of action which is particularised. This, as a matter of pleading, is clearly wrong since each individual assault was a separate tort and in respect of each one there is a separate cause of action. However, that will not have any effect on the outcome of the proceedings. I attach a schedule of the various offences committed on the plaintiff by the defendant. All are serious offences. Carnal knowledge of a child under the age of 10 years rendered the perpetrator liable to a sentence of life imprisonment. The offender could also have been charged with rape, which also carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

3The defendant pleaded guilty to a number of charges, including carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 10 years, when he was brought before the District Court for sentence and has failed to file any defence in the current civil proceedings. As a result, there judgment was entered against him and I am required to assess damages.

4The plaintiff seeks general damages as compensation for the wrong she suffered and aggravated general damages because of the nature of the sexual assaults. She does not seek exemplary damages because the defendant is serving a term of imprisonment and exemplary damages cannot be awarded to her (See Gray v the Motor Accident Commission (1998-1999 196 CLR 1.)

Facts

5The plaintiff was the victim of most appalling sexual assaults from the time she was four years old until she was nearly 14 years old. The assailant was her natural father.

6Each sexual assault and each accompanying physical assault could have been separately pleaded and she would have been entitled to damages in respect of each individual assault. The initial attacks on her involved him coming into her bedroom pulling out his penis and making her rub it. He would also force her legs apart and perform cunnilingus on her. This would be followed by fellatio, performed roughly and in which he held her hands down, forcing his penis into her throat until she found it difficult to breathe. This course of events occurred many times between the time she was five years old and the time she was six years old. Like most paedophiles, he told her that this was their little secret, he did it because he loved her and she wanted it, but if she told anyone, he would have to hurt her.

7On a number of occasions during these early years, her mother walked in while sexual activity was going on, but said nothing, merely taking her elder sister out of the flat in which the family lived, presumably so that the plaintiff's father could continue to abuse her.

8The plaintiff was born in 1959 and the abuse would have started in 1963 or 1964. At the time, the early sexual acts would have rendered him liable under section 76 of the Crimes Act 1900, as amended, to prosecution for indecent assault, for which he would have been liable to imprisonment for 5 years

9When she was about six years old, abuse of this type continued, but he also would insert a finger in her vagina while he was committing fellatio on her. He frequently ejaculated into her mouth and compelled her to swallow the ejaculate. From time to time she would vomit and that would get her into trouble with him. When these sessions concluded, he would order her to clean herself up and would threaten her with physical harm if she did not do so. These types of sexual acts continued regularly until she was eight years old.

10He also forced his penis so far down her throat that that she felt she was going to choke. 

11The sexual activity I have so far related, caused her to cry and it also had the effect that she could not form relationships with other children. At school she had no friends and sat alone at meal breaks, unless her sister was there. She could not concentrate in classes and was unaware of what was being taught. She also began to engage in inappropriate sexually explicit behaviour such as rubbing her genitalia against the corners of desks. At the age of eight her father began telling stories of his having extramarital sex with a number of women and what he did with them for example shaking up a bottle of drink, inserting it into the vagina of a woman and then sucking it out. When she was eight years old, he placed a soft drink bottle in her vagina having shaken it up and then went down and sucked her vagina to get out the drink. He also claimed to her that he inserted fruit tingles into the vagina of a woman and then used his tongue to suck them. He also did this on her.

12When she was eight years old, he adopted a practice after sexually abusing her orally in a bedroom of making her go to a bathroom where she had to lie on the floor while he inserted a douche into her vagina and squirted water into her vagina that caused her a great deal of pain. When she screamed, he went to hit her; she stopped screaming and went into a state of dissociation. 

13As these years went on he also physically struck her, threatened her and abused her. The result of all this was that she had no self-esteem. At the age of eight, he also commenced to insert his penis into her vagina and engaged in this activity as well as the other forms of sexual abuse until she was 13 years old. When he started inserting his penis into her vagina he would lie on top of her, causing her to feel that she would cease breathing. On one occasion her mother walked in, saw what was happening and walked out. To assist with penile/vagina intercourse, he would insert vaseline into her vagina. After he had intercourse he would compel her to remove all of the vaseline and use the douche so that there was no semen on her clothing.

14He would claim that he was showing her love that then would threaten to kill her if she told anyone. When she was 12 years old, he would frequently become enraged with her and would grab her and smash the right side of her head against a wall. She now wears a hearing aid in her right ear. She believes her hearing loss in her right ear was caused by her father smashing her head repeatedly against a wall. She did not produce any medical evidence to support this belief.

15At one stage she became a compulsive eater.

16As she got older, her father started to travel overseas for work purposes and would abuse her sexually before he left and then when he returned would tell her about all the women he had sex with when he was overseas. Frequently when he returned home from work he hit her with a belt.

17When she was 13 years old, she first got her period and he purchased a large quantity of contraceptive pills from someplace in Hong Kong, gave them to her mother and instructed her to compel the plaintiff to use them. He ceased sexually abusing her at the age of 14 but continued to abuse her physically and psychologically until she became an adult.

18Clearly enough over these years he committed the common law offences of rape, indecent assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, incest and carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 10 years and there is no doubt that he was a sadistic sexual offender. It is hard to comprehend that a man would treat his own daughter in such a cruel and heartless fashion. I have been told that he pleaded guilty to a series of offences and was given a minimum term of seven years imprisonment with a maximum term of fourteen years.

Consideration

19In my opinion, she has an entitlement to common law damages of a very high level. She has given evidence, which I accept, that she has had a very disrupted adult life. She married a man she knew to be a homosexual and whom she did not love and had a daughter who committed suicide at the age of 17 years. Her husband, who was a solicitor, was involved with a wealthy homosexual man in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. That man was murdered. There have been two Coronial enquiries, but no conclusive finding has been made as to who carried out the murder. Her husband was indicted and convicted for fraud in connection with the deceased man's will.

20She has now married another man and appears to be happy with him, but is afraid that he will leave her because she is fat and unattractive. This belief obviously relates back to her father's continually telling her that she was fat and unattractive. To my eyes, she is beautiful and quite slender.

21She failed to get a Higher School Certificate and I am certain that this was because of her disrupted schooling caused by the abuse of her by the defendant. She commenced work as a nurse, but abandoned it. She even went to work in her father's company and whilst there had a traumatic miscarriage.

22Her working life was very disrupted and it took some time before she could commence studies as a teacher and then become a teacher in the state education system. I accept that the disruptions in her life that caused her to embark on this career later then she should have done resulted from the abuse she suffered at the hands of the defendant. One of the consequences of her starting a teaching career so late was that she could not join the State Superannuation Scheme, which was closed to new members in 1985. She did not become a teacher until after that.

23She has also been promoted twice to the rank of Assistant Principal and then has lost the position because of her emotional inability to continue. I am satisfied that this results from the sexual and physical abuse she suffered at the hands of the defendant.

24The consequences of physical and sexual abuse are always serious and there is no doubt that the victims of abuse are often affected for many years. They feel shame, guilt and a profound sense of worthlessness. They ask the questions; ""Why me? Am I so worthless?"". Very many of them do not speak about these events for many years. In her case, what made her decide to come forward was a realisation that her father, who had remarried, had a child of about four years of age. She worried that her father would abuse this child, just as he abused her. Evidence was produced at the sentencing hearing that her father had abused sexually two young half sisters of the plaintiff. This occurred overseas and he was not charged with these offences

25I have dealt with many paedophiles during 13 years of conducting criminal trials and sentencing offenders. Many of them commit offences against many victims. It is not possible to understand why a man would sexually abuse and physically abuse his own daughter. However, he has caused her immense damage that is scarcely capable of being redressed by an award of damages. His conduct is worse than that of any other father I have encountered. 

26She is entitled to substantial damages and I award her $400,000 general damages. I attribute two thirds of the damages to the past. She is entitled to interest on the past general damages. 

27She is also entitled to damages for loss of earning capacity, past and future, loss of superannuation benefits, past and future, past and future out of pocket expenses. 

Decision

28The normal jurisdictional limit of the District Court is $750,000, but because her claim involved very much more than that and because the defendant took no objection, she is entitled to damages that are up to 50% greater than the jurisdictional limit (see Richards v Cornford (2010) 76 NSWLR 573; Haddaway v Robinson & Ors [2010] NSWDC 188).

29I award damages of $1,125,000. 

30The defendant is to pay the costs of the plaintiff.

2706030,"SPAROS, Luke v R [2013] NSWCCA 223","Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of each of their Honours Fullerton J and Beech-Jones J.  Whilst I agree with the orders proposed by Beech-Jones J, I do not agree with his Honour's reasons as to the proper approach to totality where a court is sentencing for an offence in respect of which further offending is to be taken into account pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 33 (Form 1 offences).  In this regard, I agree with the remarks of Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J:  I have read the draft judgment of Beech-Jones J and agree with the orders his Honour proposes.  However, for my part, and for the reasons which follow, I would have found error in the sentencing judge's approach to the Form 1 offence in the way comprehended by the applicant's first and second grounds of appeal, but would have dismissed the appeal under s 6(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 being well satisfied that a total sentence of 15 years with a non-parole period of 9 years was warranted at law.  That would also effectively dispose of the applicant's third ground of appeal which complains that the sentencing judge ought to have ordered full concurrency between counts 1 and 2 on the indictment.  In that regard I agree with Beech-Jones J that, irrespective of the offence on the Form 1, partial accumulation was justified in this case to properly account for the distinct criminality in the offending the subject of both counts on the indictment (see [65]-[70] of his Honour's judgment).
3In expressing my own views, I gratefully adopt his Honour's recitation of the facts, his summary of the statutory context where the question of the use of the Form 1 arises and his identification of the stage in the sentencing proceedings when the error in the approach of the sentencing judge contended for by the applicant occurred.  I also gratefully adopt his Honour's analysis of the applicant's revised submissions forwarded to the Court after the further consideration was given to the principled use of Form 1 offences by this Court in Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115.   
4In summary, counsel for the applicant submitted that after taking the Form 1 offence into account when sentencing for count 2, it was not open to the sentencing judge to have regard to the Form 1 offence a second time in determining to accumulate the sentences by six months.  She submitted that this was the practical effect of his Honour's finding that ""the offence on the Form 1 militates against complete concurrence"" (see the sentencing remarks extracted in the judgment of Beech-Jones J at [30]).  She went on to submit that after having already taken the Form 1 offence into account in the calculation of the sentence on count 2 (or, using the statutory language, in s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, after taking the offence on the Form 1 into account ""in dealing"" with the offender for the principal offence), for the sentencing judge to refer to that offending a second time, and to increase the total effective sentence because of it, necessarily involves an impermissible double counting of the impact of the Form 1 offending, an approach which is not sanctioned by the operation of s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and which is contrary to the guideline judgment Re Attorney-General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146. 
5I agree with Beech-Jones J that the detailed consideration given in Abbas to the principled way that the procedure in s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act operates in sentencing practice to increase a sentence for the principal offence did not deal with the question whether the Form 1 offending can also be taken into account as part of the total criminality for totality purposes, the issue raised in this case.  However, I do not consider  that decision dictates a result in this case adverse to the applicant.  To the contrary, as I read the judgment of Bathurst CJ (with whom for practical purposes Basten JA, Hoeben CJ at CL, Garling and Campbell JJ agreed) and, in particular, his Honour's analysis of the reasoning the subject of the guideline judgment, s 33 is intended to empower a sentencing court to take Form 1 offending into account in the calculation of sentence for the principal offence, but at that stage in the sentence proceedings when the court is ""dealing with the offender for the principal offence"".  While it must be acknowledged that the phrase ""dealing with the offender"" is not defined in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, because (as Bathurst CJ observed in Abbas) ""the dealing"" leads invariably to an increase in the penalty imposed for that offence it seems to me that it is ""a dealing"" that is intended to operate at the time that the sentence for that offence is imposed and not at the next stage in the sentencing process, when questions of accumulation or concurrency are considered and before the sentencing order is ultimately made.  In my view, that interpretation is reinforced by the now settled approach to the way offences on the Form 1 are to be treated after Abbas.  Offending which is not the subject of a conviction or an admission of guilt, but which results in an increase in the sentence for the principal offence does so to reflect the need for greater weight to be given to personal deterrence and retribution, in circumstances where no penalty or separate punishment for the uncharged offending can be imposed (see Abbas per Bathurst CJ [22]-[23]).  
6On this analysis, after the criminality disclosed by the Form 1 offence was taken into account by the sentencing judge when he dealt with the applicant for count 2, and which resulted in a heavier sentence than would have been imposed had he been sentenced on that count in the absence of the Form 1 offending (see the passage of the sentencing judgment extracted at [30] of the judgment of Beech-Jones J), it was not open to his Honour, when determining whether some degree of accumulation between the two counts was warranted, to inflate, or extend the term of the effective sentence by taking the Form 1 offending into account a second time.  That is not to say that accumulation by six months between the two counts in this case was unwarranted.  Rather, it was not the Form 1 offending which dictated that result but the total criminality in the offences for which the applicant was convicted and for which he stood to be sentenced. 
7I accept, of course, that the totality principle operates to ameliorate the effect of two or more sentences being wholly accumulated by obliging the sentencing judge to make an assessment of the overall criminality in the offender's criminal conduct to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences.  However, in accordance with the approach mandated in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, this necessarily occurs after the individual sentences have been imposed, since it is only at that time that any informed assessment can be made of the degree of adjustment necessary to achieve the relativity between the effective sentence and the total criminality in the offences for which the offender has been convicted.  In my view, the sentencing judge is not permitted to take into account in that assessment the criminality reflected in the offences the offender asked be taken into account on the Form 1 and for which he or she has not been convicted.  I regard the reference to the overall criminality in the various seminal authorities concerned with the totality principle to which Beech-Jones J has referred at [38]-[41] as limited to the offending the subject of a criminal conviction. 
8BEECH-JONES J: This is an application for leave to appeal from sentences imposed by the District Court in respect of two serious drug offences. The application raises a short but important point concerning the manner in which sentencing judges can take into account additional charges filed with the Court pursuant to s 32(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the ""Sentencing Act"") in structuring a sentence for two or more offences (so called ""Form 1 offences"").  
9On 28 October 2011 the applicant was sentenced. He had pleaded guilty to both counts on a two count indictment. Count 1 had charged him with importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, contrary to s 307.1(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the ""import offence""). Count 2 had charged him with the supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely cocaine, contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the ""supply offence""). 
10In accordance with Division 3 of Part 3 of the Sentencing Act both the prosecution and the applicant requested the sentencing judge take into account a further charge of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 when dealing with the applicant for the supply offence (the ""Form 1 offence""). 
11In relation to count 1 the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 14 years and six months, commencing on 25 January 2008. The sentencing judge fixed a non-parole period of eight years and six months due to expire on 24 July 2016 and a parole period of six years commencing 25 July 2016 and expiring on 24 July 2022.
12In relation to count 2 the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years and four months consisting of a non-parole period of three years and three months. The sentence for count 2 was fixed to commence on 25 July 2007, with the non-parole period expiring on 24 October 2010.  
13The effect of the two sentences was that the applicant received a total sentence of 15 years and a combined non-parole period of nine years commencing 25 July 2007. 
14After the conclusion of oral argument on the appeal the Court indicated that it would reserve its judgment until the publication of the judgment of this Court constituted by five members in Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115 (""Abbas""). The decision in Abbas was published on 22 May 2013. After that judgment the appellant filed supplementary submissions.
The offences
15It is unnecessary to address the reasons why the sentencing judge backdated the commencement of the sentence for count 2 to 25 July 2007. It need only be noted that his Honour ordered a partial accumulation of the two sentences with the result that the applicant was incarcerated for a period of six months solely on the supply charge. It is only this aspect of the sentencing that is attacked on appeal. No issue is taken with the length of the individual sentences. Accordingly, to address the arguments made on appeal it is only necessary to summarise the facts surrounding the offences.  They were set out in an agreed statement of facts tendered to the sentencing judge. 
16In relation to the import offence, the applicant and his co-offender, Alen Moradian, were assisted in the importation of the cocaine by a person whose identity cannot be revealed (""Mr T""). Mr T worked for his family freight business, T International. Mr T provided false importation documents using the names of his firm's existing customers and the products they had previously imported to assist in the importation of cocaine.  
17It appears that, to the knowledge of the applicant and Mr Moradian, Mr T had assisted two other individuals to import cocaine. This led the applicant and Mr Moradian to employ a private investigator to locate Mr T. The private investigator was successful. In October 2006 the applicant and Mr Moradian visited Mr T at his home in an attempt to recruit him. Mr Moradian handed Mr T a bag containing $500,000.00 in cash said to be a ""gesture of good will"". Further meetings took place in which it was proposed that Mr T assist in the importation of cocaine by providing forged documents and the services of T International.  Mr T ultimately agreed. 
18On a number of occasions Mr T met with the applicant, Mr Moradian and another co-offender.  Sometime in late 2006 that co-offender attended a meeting with Mr T and handed him $1,000,000.00 in cash.  Subsequently, Mr T created the documents to be used to facilitate the importation and provided them to Mr Moradian. Also at some point after July 2006 the applicant used the services of a foreign exchange dealer to change $1,000,000.00 from Australian currency to United States dollars. This sum was used in part payment for the cocaine. 
19Associates of Mr Moradian sourced and packaged the cocaine in the United States. It was packed in 1kg blocks and secreted in packets of ""saw blades"" in conformity with the documentation provided by Mr T.  The shipment of cocaine arrived in Australia on 19 December 2006. It was collected from the cargo company on 20 December 2006 by an employee of T International. The total weight of the shipment was 367kg gross.  Mr T contacted Mr Moradian and told him that the shipment had arrived. He drove to a location nominated by Mr Moradian with the shipment placed on the back of the utility vehicle he was driving.  Mr T then followed Mr Moradian to a townhouse. The applicant was at the townhouse, where the shipment, including the cocaine, was unpacked. 
20By this time the applicant and his co-offenders were under police surveillance. The police identified various premises being used by the applicant and his co-offenders.  On 28 February 2007 police executed a search warrant at one of these locations and found various items associated with the importation, including 657 grams of cocaine. 
21It was an agreed fact that the importation yielded a pure weight of cocaine of between 40 to 60 kg.  The commercial quantity of cocaine which founded the s 307.1 charge is 2kgs. The import offence carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 
22The agreed facts contained a description of the applicant's role. He was described as being ""subordinate only to Moradian, who was a middle level manager"". It was agreed that his role was ""significant to give effect to the importation"" and that his conduct embraced substantial aspects of it, including: engaging the private investigator to find Mr T; participating in the initial meetings with Mr T; facilitating the renting of various properties used in relation to the importation; receiving and unpacking the cocaine; organising the financing of the importation; and collecting some of the proceeds derived from the importation. 
23The sentencing judge found as follows:
""Here, a very high commercial quantity of the drug with a correspondingly high street value was imported. The offender played a senior role in an enterprise that was well planned and of some sophistication. His role was important to its success. He took a degree of risk with an expectation of large reward. His motivation was personal profit and greed.""  
24In relation to the supply charge, the agreed facts reveal that when the cocaine was unpacked the applicant and Mr Moradian supplied a 1kg block of cocaine to Mr T.  The price was said to have been ""discounted"" to $90,000.00, in that it was said that ""one normally sold for $150,000 to $190,000 dollars"".  The sentencing judge referred to this as a ""spontaneous gesture to a fellow offender"".  The maximum penalty for this offence was also life imprisonment (Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, ss 25(2) and 33, Schedule 1). 
25In relation to the Form 1 offence, the amount in total that was dealt with was $2,452,155.00, constituted as follows. First, by the $500,000.00 in cash that was given by the applicant and Mr Moradian to Mr T in October 2006 as a ""gesture of goodwill"".  Second, by the $1,000,000.00 the applicant provided to the foreign exchange dealer to change into US dollars in part payment for the cocaine. Third, by an amount of $38,155.00 paid in cash by the applicant for a motorcycle given to Mr Moradian as a wedding present sometime between 7 December 2006 and 10 January 2007. Fourth, by the payment by Mr Moradian in the presence of Mr Sparos of $100,000.00 in cash for a motor vehicle in late January 2007. Fifth, by an amount of $814,000.00 in cash found in a vehicle that the applicant and another co-offender travelled in to New South Wales from Queensland in February 2007. By his plea, the applicant accepted that he had dealt with all of the above sums knowing that they were the proceeds of crime.  The maximum penalty for that offence was 15 years imprisonment. 
Grounds 1 and 2 of the Appeal: Concurrency and the Form 1 Offences
26Ground 1 of the appeal contends that his Honour erred in the application of the principle of totality in partially accumulating the sentence for the import offence upon the sentence for the supply offence. Ground 2 contends that his Honour erred in accumulating the sentence imposed for the supply offence ""on account of the criminality [disclosed by the offence set out] in the form one"". 
27It is apparent that both grounds of appeal are solely concerned with only so much of the sentence as was accumulated, namely six months. Counsel for the applicant, Ms Francis, did not differentiate between the two grounds but instead advanced three separate but related points in support of both of them. First, in her initial written and oral submissions Ms Francis contended that the sentencing judge erred in considering the circumstances disclosed by the Form 1 offence in determining whether or not to make the sentences for the import and supply offences wholly concurrent. It was submitted that, as a matter of law, the sentencing judge was precluded from considering those circumstances at that stage of the sentencing process. In her supplementary submissions Ms Francis reiterated this ground. In particular it was contended that the sentencing judge had engaged in ""double counting"" by considering the criminality disclosed by the Form 1 offence in imposing a penalty for the principal offence, and then again at the point of determining whether the sentence for both offences on the indictment should be partially or wholly concurrent. 
28Second, in oral submissions it was contended that the sentencing judge erred in considering the need for retribution for the conduct disclosed by the Form 1 offence. 
29Third, it was also submitted in the initial submissions that the circumstances of the supply offence mandated that any sentence for that offence be wholly concurrent with that of the import offence. While it is not clear whether this third point was dependent on the success of either of the first two I will address it on both bases. 
Form 1 offences and totality
30In support of her submissions on the first point Ms Francis pointed to the following passage in the sentencing judgment:
""The Form 1
While I must focus on the sentence for the primary offence, a Form 1 can and, as I have indicated, does lead to an increase in the sentence that would otherwise be imposed for the principal offence. Sometimes that increase can be considerable. Here the offender asks that I take into account that he knowingly dealt with the proceeds of crime in the sum of close to two and a half million dollars. 
The immense sums able to be taken from users by drug traders are clearly illustrated in this case. The trade in drugs causes immense harm to the community and to individuals. Black money in the community also undermines the community's economic well-being. To willingly participate in the process, knowing what he was doing and knowing the source of the money was illicit, makes this particular matter on a Form 1, when one considers the sum involved, a very serious crime indeed. 
Some of the money involved was clearly and intimately involved with the importation, for instance the $500,000 given to Mr T and the $1AUD million changed into US dollars. Other sums involved the movement of the apparent profits of the importation. 
In February 2007 the offender travelled with Ahmed Arja to Queensland. On 28 February 2007 the offender and Arja were stopped and searched driving from Queensland to Newcastle with $814,000 in cash in the car. I sentenced Mr Arja to a suspended sentence of fifteen months for his role in this crime. I took into account the utilitarian value of his plea, the delay and his strong subjective case. 
The remainder of the money concerned with the Form 1 relates to luxury motor vehicles consistent with the large sorts of profits that can be made by involving oneself with the importation of illicit drugs. The Form 1 matter requires an increase in the sentence for the principal offence and militates against complete concurrence of that offence with that to be imposed for the Commonwealth matters.""  (emphasis added)
31Ms Francis submitted that the emphasised part of this passage reveals that the sentencing judge took into account the criminality of the applicant as revealed by the Form 1 offence in determining whether the sentence for the supply offence should be made wholly concurrent with the sentence for the import offence.  She initially contended that this reasoning was inconsistent with the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Re Attorney-General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 (""Attorney General's Application No 1"").   As I have stated later, she reformulated this complaint as one involving double counting by the sentencing judge.
32In addressing this contention it is important to note both the statutory context in which this issue arises and the relevant stage of the sentencing process at which this asserted error is said to have occurred. The legislative regime is to be found in Division 3 of Part 3 of the Sentencing Act. The relevant direction to a sentencing judge is to be found in s 33, to which there has been no relevant change since the judgment in Attorney General's Application No 1. Section 33 provides:
""33   Outstanding charges may be taken into account
(1)  When dealing with the offender for the principal offence, the court is to ask the offender whether the offender wants the court to take any further offences into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence.
(2)  The court may take a further offence into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence:
(a)  if the offender:
(i)  admits guilt to the further offence, and
(ii)  indicates that the offender wants the court to take the further offence into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence, and
(b)  if, in all of the circumstances, the court considers it appropriate to do so.
(3)  If the court takes a further offence into account, the penalty imposed on the offender for the principal offence must not exceed the maximum penalty that the court could have imposed for the principal offence had the further offence not been taken into account.
..."" (emphasis added)
33Two matters should be noted about s 33(2). First, one aspect of the statutory permission conferred by s 33(2) is that, once it is engaged, the Form 1 offence(s) may be ""taken into account"" in sentencing for the principal offence. As noted by Hoeben CJ at CL in Abbas at [91] this ""leaves open a wide range of factors, including the weight to be given to a particular matter, and how it may be taken into account in a particular case"". 
34Second, once the provision is engaged, it operates upon the Court in ""dealing with the offender"". The phrase ""dealing with the offender"" is not defined in the Sentencing Act. In this case the relevant ""dealing"" the subject of the challenge is the exercise of the power conferred by the s 47 of the Sentencing Act to fix a commencement date for the sentence and, in particular, to fix a commencement date prior to the date on which the sentence was imposed (s 47(2)). This is further addressed below. 
35Nothing in the express text of any of the statutory provisions just described purports to limit, in the manner contended for by the applicant, the way in which the sentencing judge was able to ""take ... into account"" the Form 1 offence when fixing a start date for the supply charge.
36This conclusion is, of course, not the end of the analysis as consideration also needs to be given to established principles governing the fixing of commencement dates for different sentences. In this context it is important to note that the asserted error in this case did not arise at the point of determining the appropriate sentence for the supply offence but at what is usually the next step in the sentencing process:
""A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality"". (emphasis added) (Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 (""Pearce"") at [45] per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ).
37The body of case law concerning the circumstances in which sentences will be made either fully or partly concurrent or cumulative, including the totality principle, operates upon ""dealing"" with an offender in accordance with s 33(1) and fixing commencement dates under s 47 (subject to any express provision to the contrary).  It is the scope of the totality principle that is relevant to the resolution of the appeal. 
38The High Court's judgment in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 extracts a number of passages from texts and judgments concerning the operation of the totality principle. These include the following passage from DA Thomas, Principles of Sentencing, 2nd ed (1979) at 56 to 57 (Mill at 62 to 63):
""The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate is 'just and appropriate'. The principle has been stated many times in various forms: 'when a number of offences are being dealt with and specific punishments in respect of them are being totted up to make a total, it is always necessary for the court to take a last look at the total just to see whether it looks wrong[']; 'when ... cases of multiplicity of offences come before the court, the court must not content itself by doing the arithmetic and passing the sentence which the arithmetic produces. It must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences'.""(references omitted, emphasis added)
39Mill also cited the following passage from R v Knight (1981) 26 SASR 573 at 576 (Mill at 63):
""[I]t seems to us that when regard is had to the totality of the sentences which the applicant is required to undergo, it cannot be said that in all the circumstances of the case, the imposition of a cumulative sentence was incommensurate with the gravity of the whole of his proven criminal conduct or with his due deserts. To use the language of Lord Parker L.C.J. in Reg. v. Faulkner, 'at the end of the day, as one always must, one looks at the totality and asks whether it was too much'.""(references omitted, emphasis added) 
40To similar effect in R v Holder (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 260 Street CJ described the totality principle as follows: 
""The principle of totality is a convenient phrase, descriptive of the significant practical consideration confronting a sentencing judge when sentencing for two or more offences. Not infrequently a straightforward arithmetical addition of sentences appropriate for each individual offence considered separately will arrive at an ultimate aggregate that exceeds what is called for in the whole of the circumstances. In such a situation the sentencing judge will evaluate, in a broad sense, the overall criminality involved in all of the offences and, having done so, will determine what, if any, downward adjustment is necessary, whether by telescoping or otherwise, in the aggregate sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences."" (emphasis added)
41Further in Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 at [4] Gleeson CJ cited with approval a passage from the judgment of Wells J in The Attorney-General v Tichy (1982) 30 SASR 84 at 92 to 93, which I extract in part:
""When an accused is on trial it is part of the procedural privilege to which he is entitled that he should be made aware of precisely what charges he is to meet. But the practice and principles of sentencing owe little to such procedure; what is fitting is that a convicted prisoner should be sentenced, not simply and indiscriminately for every act that can be singled out and brought within the compass of a technically identifiable conviction, but for what, viewing the circumstances broadly and reasonably, can be characterised as his criminal conduct. Sometimes, a single act of criminal conduct will comprise two or more technically identified crimes. Sometimes, two or more technically identified crimes will comprise two or more courses of criminal conduct that, reasonably characterised, are really separate invasions of the community's right to peace and order, notwithstanding that they are historically interdependent; the courses of criminal conduct may coincide with the technical offences or they may not.""(emphasis added)
42It is clear that the totality principle is a mitigating principle that operates to ameliorate what would otherwise be the harsh effect of simply accumulating the appropriate sentences for each offence for which an offender is convicted (see also R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; 164 A Crim R 481  at [11] per Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ). Further, all of the above formulations require that when applying the totality principle the sentencing judge address the ""overall criminality involved"". In this case the question of principle is whether the assessment of the ""overall criminality involved"" for the purpose of the application of the totality principle extends to the criminality disclosed in the Form 1 offence. While the above passages were written in a different context and thus do not dictate an answer to the present question they certainly do not provide support for the limitation on s 33(2) contended for by Ms Francis. In my view, they suggest the opposite in that they reinforce the artificiality of excluding the admitted criminality disclosed in a Form 1 offence from the determination of the offender's overall criminality for the purpose of applying the mitigating principle of totality.
43To this point nothing in the text of the relevant statutory provision or the formulation of the totality principle that governs its exercise supports Ms Francis' first submission.  This leads to a consideration of  the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Application No 1 (with whom Wood CJ at CL, Grove, Sully and James JJ agreed) and the judgments in Abbas.
44In Attorney General's Application No 1, the Attorney General applied for a guideline judgment  (see Division 4 of Part 3 of the Sentencing Act) concerning the approach to be adopted towards sentencing for offences in respect of which a list of additional charges under s 32(1) of the Sentencing Act has been prepared.  Spigelman CJ rejected the Attorney General's contention that a ""top down"" approach involving the notional formulation of a separate sentence for Form 1 offences should be adopted (see Attorney General's Application No 1 at [25] and [39]).  Instead his Honour stated the approach to be adopted in the following passages to which Ms Francis referred the Court:
""[39] The sentencing court is sentencing only for the ""principal offence"". It is no part of the task of the sentencing court to determine appropriate sentences for offences listed on a Form 1 or to determine the overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences and then apply a ""discount"" for the use of the procedure. This is not sentencing for the principal offence.
[40] In my opinion, it is pertinent to identify the elements to be considered in determining the sentence for the primary offence upon which the commission of other offences, for which no conviction is being recorded, may impinge. The case law has identified a number of distinct and sometimes overlapping purposes to be served by sentencing. In my opinion, not all these purposes are relevant to the process of taking other offences into account, when sentencing for a particular offence, that is, the primary offence. 
...
[42] The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.
[43] I did not intend these observations to be exhaustive of the elements upon which the fact of other offences may impinge. However, no additional elements for which that could be so have been identified in submissions to this Court. The important point is that the focus throughout must be on sentencing for the primary offence.""
45I have set out these passages in their entirety because there was debate during the appeal as to their meaning and scope. In my view these passages were only directed towards the specific matter that the Court was asked to address, namely the determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the principal offence referred to in s 33(1). Thus these passages are directed to the first step of the sentencing process identified in the passage from Pearce cited above.  They are not addressed to the next step identified in the above passage from Pearce, namely, where there are two or more sentences, should the sentences be wholly or partly concurrent or accumulated? 
46Further, the reference to the ""principle of totality"" in [42] of Attorney General's Application No 1 needs also to be placed in context. Consistent with the above analysis, Spigelman CJ identified that principle as limiting the amount that a sentence for the principal offence could be increased by reference to the offences listed on a Form 1. Spigelman CJ held that such a sentence could not exceed either the maximum for that offence nor that which would be appropriate having regard to the totality of the criminality disclosed by that offence and the offences listed on the Form 1. The reference to ""totality"" must embrace the conduct listed in the Form 1 as the phrase ""totality"" has no sensible meaning if only one offence is being considered.  In my view this is confirmed by or at least not inconsistent with the judgments in Abbas.
47Again there is nothing in these passages from Spigelman CJ's judgment in Attorney General's Application No 1 which suggests that the criminality disclosed by Form 1 offences cannot be considered when determining whether the sentence for the principal offence will be made concurrent, in part or in whole, with the sentence for some other offence. To the contrary, given that on my reading of [42] of Attorney General's Application No 1 Spigelman CJ accepted that the criminality disclosed by the Form 1 offences could be considered in applying the mitigating principle of totality to the determination of the sentence for the principal offence, it would seem incongruous if the same approach did not operate at the next stage of the sentencing process.
48Ms Francis also relied on the statement in [39] of Attorney General's Application No 1, which emphasises that an offender is only to be sentenced for the principal offence, when considered with the following other parts of that judgment:
""[24] The 'top down' approach which, notionally, identifies an appropriate penalty for the full gamut of offences, appears to me to be inconsistent with this principle. No doubt it can be said that even the 'bottom up' approach involves, in a sense, punishment 'for' the Form 1 offences, because the penalty for the primary offence is increased. (See, eg, R v Anderson [1978] AC 964 at 977-978, per Lord Diplock.) But that is not necessarily the case, as I sought to show in R v Barton (2001) 121 A Crim R 185 at 195 [64]. (Lord Diplock's observations were appropriately qualified by Neasey J in R v Jones [1978] Tas SR 126 at 131.)
...
[29] I do not understand Wood CJ at CL's reference in R v Bavadra to the 'totality of criminality' to suggest that a sentencing judge should determine sentences for all the offences before the judge, whether on the indictment or on the Form 1. I understand his Honour to have intended no more than the proposition for which Simpson J referred to R v Bavadra as authority in R v Harris (2001) 125 A Crim R 27 at 31 [23] that a sentencing judge '... should give due recognition to the gravity of those offences'. If, contrary to my understanding, the reference in R v Bavadra was intended to suggest that a sentencing judge was imposing punishment for the Form 1 offences, I would respectfully disagree that this is permissible under the statute. The focus, as I  will show below, must be on 'the principal offence' alone.""
49Ms Francis contended that, by considering the gravity of the criminal conduct disclosed by the offence listed in the Form 1 at the point of determining whether the sentence for the supply offence should be wholly or only partly concurrent with the sentence for the import offence, the sentencing judge was not sentencing the applicant ""only"" for the supply offence. Instead, she submitted, the sentencing judge was in substance punishing him for an offence for which he had not been convicted (cf Attorney General Application No 1 at [24] and [39]).
50This overstates the effect of these passages from Attorney General's Application No 1. In my view the relevant limitation on the operation of s 33(2) of the Sentencing Act that emerges from all of the above passages from Attorney General's Application No 1 is that no part of the sentencing exercise is to involve the assessment or imposition of any  separate sentence for the Form 1 offence(s).  This was accepted by all the judgments in Abbas (at [14] per Bathurst CJ, at [64] per Basten JA, at [104] to [105] per Hoeben CJ at CL, at [154] to [155] per Garling J and at [256] per Campbell J). Subject to that limitation, all of these judgments confirm that the reference in s 33(2) of the Sentencing Act to taking into account offences on a Form 1 warrants a consideration of the criminality involved in those offences and can justify the imposition of a longer sentence for the ""principal offence"".  Thus Bathurst CJ stated (at [22] to [23]):
""[22]  In my respectful opinion, the approach suggested by Adams J [in R v Dionys [2011] NSWCCA 272 at [10] and R v Calcutt [2012] NSWCCA 40 at [42]]  is incorrect if it is interpreted as meaning that a sentence cannot be increased to take into account an additional need for deterrence and retribution in respect of the offences charged by virtue of the Form 1 offences being taken into account. Such an interpretation is contrary, in my opinion, to the meaning of s 33 properly construed and to what was said by Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Reference. Section 33(1) empowers the Court to take the further offences into account where the preconditions in that section and s 32 are met. It is clear from the provisions of s 33(3) that that could lead to an increase in penalty up to the maximum penalty for the principal offence. The existence of these additional offences may demonstrate the greater need for personal deterrence and retribution in respect of the offence charged. This does not mean the Court is imposing a separate penalty for the Form 1 offences. Rather, as part of the instinctive synthesis approach to sentencing explained by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]-[54], it takes these matters into account as required by the statute in determining the appropriate penalty for the offence for which the offender is convicted.
[23] That approach would generally, but not universally, lead to the imposition of a sentence longer, and in some cases significantly longer, than would otherwise be required if the Form 1 offences were not taken into account: R v Barton [2001] NSWCCA 63; (2001) 121 A Crim R 185. That does not mean that the principle of proportionality referred to by the High Court in cases such as Hoare v The Queen [1989] HCA 33; (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354; Veen v The Queen (No 2) supra at 472 and 477; Markarian supra at [83], is offended. Rather, the fact that the sentence is to be determined by reference to the additional need for personal deterrence and retribution for the offence for which the offender is being sentenced as a result of the Form 1 charges means that the principle of proportionality falls to be assessed by reference to matters which include those additional factors. That does not involve any injustice to the offender who has chosen to avail him or herself of the s 33 procedure. Nor does it mean that the offender is being sentenced for offences for which he or she has not been convicted. This is because the sentence is imposed by reference to the offence for which the offender has been convicted, by contrast to the ""top down"" approach rejected in Attorney General's Reference.""
51Further at [64] Basten JA stated:
""[Attorney General's Reference No 1] did not reject an effective increase in the sentence for the principal offence on account of the additional criminality revealed in the admitted further offences.""
52Hoeben CJ at CL stated at [104]:
""As Spigelman CJ noted in the guideline judgment at [24], as a matter of semantics it can be said that any increase in the sentence imposed for the principal offence by reference to Form 1 offences, could be characterised as punishment 'for' the Form 1 offences. Such an approach, however, gives too broad a meaning to the concept of 'punish' and would apply to any increase in the sentence for the principal offence based on the Form 1 offences. To follow such an approach, would defeat 'the entire point of the [Form 1] process'.""
53Garling J agreed with Bathurst CJ (at [154]) and ""agreed generally"" with the additional observations of Hoeben CJ at CL (at [155]).  Campbell J stated at [258]:
""In my view, if at the request of an offender the Court is take further offences into account ""in dealing with the offender for the principal offence"" it is inevitable that regard must be had to the criminality involved in those further offences. By dint of s 33 Sentencing Procedure Act the admitted further offences on the Form 1 are matters which necessarily bear upon the judgment to be reached about the appropriate sentence for the principal offence. No sensible bearing can be taken from them unless some assessment is made of the criminality involved in the further offences.""
54These passages are emphatic in confirming that the criminality disclosed by offences on a Form 1 can and should be considered in determining the appropriate sentence for the principal offence. Of course they are all directed to the first stage of the sentencing process discussed in the extract from Pearce set out above whereas this appeal concerns the second stage. While the judgments in Abbas do not directly deny Ms Francis' contention, they do not provide any support for it either. Further the above extracts confirm that there is a question raised by Ms Francis' proposition which,  in my view, has not been answered, namely why should the criminality disclosed by a Form 1 offence be considered at the first stage of the sentencing process but be excluded at the next stage? 
55Put another way, what is the source of the alleged prohibition on the sentencing judge considering the offence disclosed in a form 1 when fixing a commencing date for the principal offence? This is fundamentally a question of statutory construction. On their face the phrases ""dealing with the offender"" and ""take ...into account"" in ss 33(1) and 33(2) are more than sufficient to enable a sentencing judge to consider a Form 1 offence when addressing questions of cumulation and concurrency that arise with respect to the principal offence and another offence. With respect to the view expressed by Fullerton J (at [5]), I cannot discern anything in the judgment of Bathurst CJ in Abbas that suggests that the phrase ""dealing with an offender"" is only a reference to the fixing of the length of a sentence and is not a reference to the exercise of the power conferred by s 47(2) of the Sentencing Act to fix a commencing date for the sentence on a date prior to the date the sentence was imposed. The discussion in Abbas concerning the need to consider the criminality disclosed by the Form 1 offence when addressing the need for greater weight to be given to personal deterrence and retribution all took place in the context of considering the first stage of the sentencing process. I cannot discern anything in that discussion that warrants a reading down of ss 33(1) and 33(2) in their application at the next stage of the sentencing process.
56An acceptance of the appellant's proposition would require a sentencing judge to approach the first stage of the sentencing process on a basis that includes a consideration of the offence disclosed on a Form 1 and then adopt a different and narrower basis at another stage by excluding the offence disclosed on the Form 1. In my view there would need to be a compelling reason for construing the phrases ""dealing with"" and ""take ... into account"" in s 33(1) and (2) so that they had that result. In my respectful opinion none has been demonstrated.   
57Finally I do not consider that the appellant gains any assistance by characterising  the sentencing judge's approach in this case as involving a form of ""double counting"". As I have explained the totality principle operates to mitigate the harsh result that would otherwise ensue if separate sentences were fully accumulated upon one another. The principle is conditioned upon an assessment of the offender's overall criminality. If that assessment is informed by a consideration of the criminality of offences disclosed on a Form 1 that does not amount to the imposition of a separate punishment for those offences without a conviction and nor does it involve ""double counting"".  It is simply another example of how the Form 1 offences operate to reduce the leniency that might otherwise be afforded to an offender.  If it were otherwise all consideration of questions of concurrency and accumulation would involve ""double counting"" in that the criminality of an offence informs both the sentence for that offence and whether that sentence will be made wholly or partly concurrent or wholly cumulative upon the sentence for another offence. 
58In my view it follows that in this case the question for the sentencing judge was whether to make the sentence for the supply charge wholly concurrent with the sentence for the import charge. The governing principle in such a circumstance was stated by Howie J in Cahyadi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] (with whom Adams and Price JJ agreed):
""In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.""
59It follows from the above that I consider that it is open to a sentencing judge to consider the criminality disclosed by offences listed in a Form 1 for the purpose of determining whether the sentence for the principal offence to which they relate should be made wholly concurrent, partly concurrent or wholly cumulative upon any sentence to be imposed for other offences. The offences disclosed in a Form 1 may inform the assessment of the totality of the criminal conduct involved.  In this case that meant that, if the sentence for the importation offence was such that it comprehended and reflected the criminality of the supply offence and the Form 1 offence, then full concurrency was warranted. If it could not, then at least some partial accumulation was warranted.  
60In this case the sentencing judge analysed the criminal conduct disclosed by the Form 1 offence and concluded that some of it was ""clearly and intimately involved with the importation"" but that ""[o]ther sums involved the movement of the apparent profits of the importation"". Thus his Honour concluded that this latter aspect of the dealing in the profits of the importation was an additional matter that meant that partial, albeit limited, concurrency of the sentence for the supply offence with that of the import offence was warranted when considered with the facts of the supply offence.  I do not discern any error in that assessment.
Form 1 offences and retribution 
61The second submission made by Ms Francis concerned the relevance of the Form 1 offence to the element of retribution in the sentencing exercise. In the passage from Attorney General's Application No 1 at [42] that I have extracted above Spigelman CJ referred to ""the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed."" Ms Francis submitted that this does not authorise the exaction of retribution for the offences on a Form 1 but instead concerns retribution for the principal offence. Ms Francis referred to the judgments of Adams J in R v Dionys [2011] NSWCCA 272 at [10] and R v Calcutt [2012] NSWCCA 40 at [42]. 
62This issue was addressed in Abbas.  I have already extracted the passage from the judgment of Bathurst CJ at [22] where his Honour held that in sentencing for a principal offence the additional need for retribution arising from the presence of a Form 1 offence nevertheless requires the exaction of retribution for the principal offence and not the Form 1 offence.  Basten JA did not address this issue. Hoeben CJ at CL disagreed on this issue, finding that retribution could be exacted for the Form 1 offence(s) (at [100]). Garling J agreed with Bathurst CJ (at [154]) but added that he ""agreed generally with the additional observations of Hoeben CJ at CL"" (at [155]). Campbell J agreed with Bathurst CJ and expressly disagreed with Hoeben CJ at CL on this issue (at [256]). Although Garling J stated he ""agreed generally"" with Hoeben CJ at CL, I take his Honour's specific agreement with Bathurst CJ as indicating a preference for that judgment on any matter where there was a disagreement between Bathurst CJ and Hoeben CJ at CL. Thus for present purposes the approach of Bathurst CJ represents the appropriate approach on this issue. 
63However this does not assist the applicant because there is nothing in the sentencing judgment to suggest that his Honour exacted any retribution for the Form 1 offence. The only passage in the sentencing judgment that makes any reference to retribution is where his Honour stated:
""When I formulate my sentence for the State offence I will also take into account the matter on the Form 1 by giving greater weight to considerations of personal deterrence and the community's entitlement to exact retribution for what was, in itself, serious offending."" 
64This passage is to be found in an early part of the sentencing judgment in which his Honour recited a number of general principles potentially relevant to the exercise of the sentencing function in this case. The passage is clearly referable to Attorney General's Application No 1 at [42]. However, it is expressed in terms that are ambiguous as to whether retribution should be exacted for the supply offence or the Form 1 offence or both. The topic of retribution is not referred to in any subsequent part of the sentencing judgment. In the end result I am not satisfied that his Honour attributed any weight to the need for retribution in relation to the Form 1 offence. 
Whether full concurrency was warranted
65As I have stated it was not clear whether Ms Francis' third submission that full concurrency was required was dependent on whether error was established in the manner in which the sentencing judge treated the Form 1 offence.  Her written submissions contended that full concurrency was mandated. In any event I construe the sentencing judgment as conveying that, even if the supply offence alone was considered, some accumulation was required.  I also consider that his Honour was not in error in so concluding.  
66Ms Francis pointed to the following passage in the sentencing judgment:
""As indicated, the supply shared a number of critical elements with the importation as the same cocaine was involved. The significant overlap in the criminality involved means most of the objects of sentencing apply equally to this offence and the importation. Given the way I will structure the sentence the supply offence's non-parole period has been subsumed by the non-parole period for the Commonwealth offence. I am, however, obliged to fix separate sentences for each offence and consider relevant New South Wales sentencing principles when fixing the sentence for the supply offence.""  (emphasis added)
67The reference in the above extract to the non-parole period for the supply offence being ""subsumed by the non-parole period for the Commonwealth offence"" was, in my view, clearly a slip in an otherwise carefully expressed judgment. The balance of the sentencing judgment suggests that his Honour meant to state that it was ""largely subsumed by the non-parole period for the Commonwealth offence"". Thus earlier in the same passage his Honour stated that ""most [i.e. not all] of the objects of sentencing"" applied equally to the supply offence and the import offence. When later discussing the circumstances of the supply offence his Honour stated that ""[a]s it occurred as an incident of the importation a considerable degree of concurrency of sentences is required"", suggesting that some accumulation was appropriate. 
68Further and contrary to Ms Francis' initial written submissions, I do not consider that a sentence structure involving complete concurrency was mandated even if the Form 1 offence was not considered at this stage of the sentencing process.  I have summarised the relevant objective facts and his Honour's findings above.  The drugs the subject of the supply charge were those that were imported. However, the conduct of the offender in agreeing with his co-offender to sell a kilogram of cocaine to Mr T at a subsidised price was clearly a separate act of criminality over and above his conduct in importing the drugs. In his Honour's words there was a ""significant overlap"" between the two offences, but it was not complete. 
69As I have stated the appropriate principle to be applied in this context was enunciated by Howie J in Cahyadi at [27].  Leaving aside the Form 1 offence, for the sentencing judge to have made the sentences for the import offence and the supply offence wholly concurrent would have resulted in there being no separate penalty for what was clearly separate criminal conduct on the appellant's part.
70Finally, I note that in support of her contention that his Honour was required to impose fully concurrent sentences Ms Francis referred the Court to the decision of the Court of Appeal of Western Australia in Blay v The Queen [2006] WASCA 248; 205 FLR 414. In Blay the appellant was charged with aiding the importation into Australia of a large amount of ecstasy contrary to s 11.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) in so far as it applied to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and with possessing the same ecstasy with intent to sell or supply contrary to s 6(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 (WA).  The Court of Appeal found that the sentencing judge had erred in not making the sentences for both offences fully concurrent and instead fixing the sentence for one of the offences to commence two years after the other (at [12] per McLure JA, with whom Wheeler JA agreed, and at [75] per Buss JA).  However the possession by the offender of the ecstasy which satisfied the elements of the offence under s 6(1)(a) was one of the acts said to constitute the aiding of the importation (see Blay at [7] and [67] to [69]). Accordingly, both McClure JA and Buss JA said that the sentences should have been wholly concurrent because there was an overlap in the elements of the offences and they were part of the one ""transaction"" or ""criminal enterprise""(at [12] and [75]). Critically McLure JA found that the offence under s 6(1)(a) did not increase the ""total criminality"" (Blay at [12]). In this case, while the drugs the subject of the supply count were part of those the subject of the import count, the supply of cocaine to Mr T was a discrete act of criminality over and above its importation.
71I would allow the application for leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
72The orders I propose are:
(i) leave to appeal against sentence be granted; and
(ii) the appeal be dismissed.

2706035,Ghosh v Miller & Ors (No. 2) [2013] NSWDC 194,"Judgment
1On I handed down a judgment in favour of Google Australia Pty Ltd, the first named defendant in these proceedings, and directed the plaintiff to file and serve an amended statement of claim on each of the remaining defendants personally, as they had previously been served by registered post, contrary to Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR"") Pt 10 r 10.21.
2I have today made an order transferring, to the District Court of NSW defamation list, the Newcastle Local Court proceedings the plaintiff separately commenced against these defendants in February 2013, as the Local Court has no jurisdiction to hear defamation actions: s 33 Local Court Act 2007 (NSW).
3The defendants have been called three times outside the court at 10.20am but have not appeared. The plaintiff tells me that she has served each of them personally at their respective home addresses. No affidavit of service has been filed.
4The plaintiff's application is for default judgment to be entered against each of the remaining defendants to these proceedings, by reason of their non-appearance today. These are my reasons for refusing to make such an order.
5Defamation proceedings were commenced against the defendants in the Local Court in February 2013, although that court had no jurisdiction to hear them. Although the plaintiff tells me from the bar table that they were served and indeed represented at some stage, the only notice they had of the proceedings in this court, on the first return date of these separately commenced proceedings (16 August 2013) was a copy of the statement of claim sent by post. On 16 August 2013, I accordingly made orders for personal service of the amended pleading on the remaining defendants after I struck out the proceedings against Google Australia Pty Ltd, the first defendant. I also directed the plaintiff to notify the remaining defendants of today's return date. 
6An amended statement of claim identifying eight publications (details of which are set out in a schedule attached to this judgment) has now been filed and, the plaintiff tells me from the bar table, served, in accordance with these orders. None of the defendants reside in Newcastle; most reside in Queensland. I do not know when, or in what circumstances, they were served. 
7These defendants should be entitled to have time to consider their position in relation to these proceedings, particularly since the eight publications identified by the plaintiff as being defamatory by the plaintiff, and as having been published by the defendants, are not only complex but also defective on their face. These defects include:
(a)The first, second, fourth and fifth matters complained of have been commenced outside the twelve-month limitation period for defamation proceedings, in circumstances where leave to extend time has not been sought, and may be difficult to obtain, for some of the reasons I have outlined in my judgment in Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd [2013] NSWDC 145;
(b)The sixth matter complained of consists of statements made in a document that is an initiating application to the Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal. That document was clearly published on an occasion protected by absolute privilege: Oliver v Bryant Strata Management Pty Ltd (1995) 41 NSWLR 514 at 520; Szanto v Bainton [2011] NSWSC 985 at [150] per Ward J; s 27(1) Defamation Act 2005 (NSW). Whether publication of the seventh matter complained of, a complaint to the Queensland Medical Board to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, is protected by absolute or qualified privilege is an issue which must be determined with regard to the appropriate legislation.
(c)The eighth matter complained of appears to consist of vulgar abuse: Mundey v Askin [1982] 3 NSWLR 369 at 371 - 2; Ivory v Millett (Supreme Court of Western Australia, 29 January 1999, Anderson J).
8However, the principal reason for not entering default judgment is that this procedure is generally inappropriate in defamation actions, for the reasons explained by Hunt J in Altarama Pty Ltd v Forsyth (1981) 1 NSWLR 188. Defamation actions have long been regarded as falling into a special category as far as default judgment applications are concerned: Markisic v Today-Denes Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 1051 at [4]; French v Triple M Melbourne Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 36. Defamation actions, once directions are given, are removed from the operation of rules fixing the time for pleading. No order has yet been given for the defendants to file a defence by any particular time, and until such order is given (and breached), or the defence struck out, or an the parties agree that damages are the only issue (and even then, the parties cannot ""agree"" as to what imputations are conveyed), the question of entry of judgment should not arise. 
9These proceedings are returned to the Defamation List in the Sydney registry for further directions on 1 November 2013. The plaintiff is directed to serve a copy of the orders made today, as well as this judgment, upon each of the defendants, by registered post, and to file an affidavit of service to this effect.
Orders
(1)The defendants called outside Newcastle Court 1 and Court 3 three times at 10:20am - no appearance.
(2)Grant leave to the plaintiff to file the Notice of Motion in the Registry today and pay the relevant filing fee.
(3)Pursuant to s 140(2) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), transfer Local Court matter 2013/76771 to the New South Wales District Court, forming part of District Court matter 2013/238215, by reason of the Local Court having no jurisdiction in defamation proceedings.
(4)Dismiss the plaintiff's application for default judgment.
(5)Matter transferred to the Defamation List in Sydney on Friday 1 November 2013.
(6)The plaintiff is to serve a copy of these orders and this judgment and these orders upon each of the defendants by registered post.

		11 October 2013",2013-10-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706037,Ghosh v Ninemsn Pty Ltd & Ors (No 3) [2013] NSWDC 206,"Judgment

1The plaintiff seeks leave to file an amended statement of claim in accordance with a document emailed on 20 September 2013 to the defendants. It is the plaintiff's sixth version of this pleading. Previous versions of this statement of claim, which in the previous draft contained 53 causes of action, have been struck out with leave to replead: [2013] NSWDC 63; [2013] NSWDC 145. The relevant background to this application is set out in those judgments.

2The current draft statement of claim pleads that ten matters complained of (five television broadcasts and five subsequent online publications) were published between the period 13 June 2012 and 5 June 2013. The plaintiff is not named in six of the ten publications pleaded.

3This judgment sets out the reasons for decision in relation to the 12 orders I made in the course of a day-long hearing at Newcastle District Court on 10 October 2013 in relation to the plaintiff's application for leave to amend. Four of the publications have survived the defendants' summary judgment and strike out applications, and these four publications have been the subject of rulings as to whether each of the imputations is reasonably capable of being conveyed. Further case management in the Defamation List will be necessary to make the matter ready for hearing. I note the defendants propose to requisition a jury.

4The defendants' objections to the latest proposed draft statement of claim fall into two categories. The first (which relates to the first, second, third, fourth, seventh and eighth publications) consists of objections to the inadequacy and prolixity of the particulars of identification for the six publications where the plaintiff is not named. The second consists of a series of objections to the imputations pleaded to arise. I shall first consider the pleadings in relation to identification of the plaintiff.

Identification issues in the first to fourth and seventh to eighth matters complained of

5Where a person is not named in the matter complained of, the test to be satisfied may be summarised as follows:

(a)There must be at least one identifiable person with knowledge of specific facts or of the plaintiff who believes that the matter complained of refers specifically to the plaintiff: Steele v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1974] 2 NSWLR 348 at 373-374. Care must be taken where the unnamed party is a corporation (such as a superannuation company), unless the fact of ownership is notorious (Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd v Parras [2002] NSWCA 202 at [45] - [51]).

(b)This particular knowledge of the plaintiff enabling such persons to make the identification they each assert must be identified and particularised (generally as extrinsic facts of identification) in the statement of claim.

(c)Although the reasoning which results in identification does not need to be clear and precise (Gardener v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 10 at [44]), those who did identify the plaintiff must be ordinary sensible readers. 

(d)The plaintiff must establish that those with the relevant knowledge of the plaintiff or of the extrinsic facts both read or saw the matter complained of and honestly identified the plaintiff could reasonably come to that conclusion: Universal Network Communication Ltd t/as New Tang Dynasty v China Media Group (Aust) Pty Ltd & Chan [2008] NSWCA 1 at [42]. This means that the imputations pleaded must be enlivened by the particulars of identification in such a way as to identify the plaintiff.Even if there is ""overwhelming"" contradictory evidence, the case should be left for the jury, as long as there is evidence upon which there could reasonably be a finding of identification: Universal Network Communication Ltd t/as New Tang Dynasty v China Media Group (Aust) Pty Ltd & Chan [2008] NSWCA 1 at [44], citing Naxakis v Western General Hospital [1999] HCA 22; (1999) 197 CLR 269 (at [16]) per Gaudron J, see also (at [1]) per Gleeson CJ, (at [40]-[45]) per McHugh J, (at [58], [66]-[68]) per Kirby J, (at [117]-[123]) per Callinan J. (I formally note that the defendants did not submit that the evidence of identification must comply with the different and additional tests set out by Basten JA in Maxwell-Smith v Warren [2007] NSWCA 270 at [45] - [51]). 

6The first problem in each of these publications is that the subject matter was not the circumstances relevant to the plaintiff's property but to ""party houses"" not only on the Gold Coast but all over Australia, and which have been the subject of a series of broadcasts by ""A Current Affair"" over a period of some years. This means that if the plaintiff wishes to assert that identification of herself as an owner of a property (or properties) referred to in these broadcasts, she should set out, in respect of each of the matters complained of, particulars of the persons with specific knowledge of the relevant identifying extrinsic facts, and what those facts are. This should have been a straightforward matter for the plaintiff. All she needed to do was to identify, for each publication, the relevant information enabling at least one person to identify her, the basis of that information and who the person(s) identifying her were.

7The single set of rolled-up particulars that the plaintiff provides for all of these matters complained of are that ""extensive video footage of the plaintiff's house is shown"" and that ""the plaintiff's neighbours are interviewed"", which particulars are asserted to have been known to a large number of persons. There is no identification of what that video footage is, or which of the plaintiff's neighbours were interviewed, or how that information came to be in the possession of any of the identification witnesses, or how that identification evidence, when added to the matter complained of, identifies the plaintiff as the person of and concerning whom the imputation(s) in question are conveyed.

8The next problem is the way in which particulars of those persons who saw one or more broadcast (or downloaded the online version), are not provided for each publication. On pages 2 - 3 of the statement of claim, a list of 35 names of persons is set out, but this list is not broken down for each publication. Nor is it claimed that all of these witnesses saw all programmes and downloaded all online versions. This first list is followed by lists of ""groups of viewers"", such as ""all court staff at Newcastle Court and Southport Magistrates Court""; ""all Police Officers in Newcastle""; ""all of the plaintiff's patients"" (a list of 1,382 names is attached) as well as the number of ""hits"" onto the ""A Current Affair"" website, some or all of which persons, the plaintiff appears to be asserting, knew that the plaintiff was the owner of a property shown in ""extensive video footage"". 

9Four of the matters complained of (the third, fourth, seventh and eighth) are extremely brief, and consist of a voice-over to quick flashes of party scenes in a series of backyard locations, difficult to distinguish from each other. It is impossible, without precise identification (for example, ""the property with a black-fenced pool"") to know what the ""extensive video footage"" of the plaintiff's rental property consists of, or how it is identified. The information set out in the particulars refers not to these actual shots, but to ""some"" viewers seeing a variety of identifying material, such as unspecified earlier programmes containing unspecified footage of the plaintiff's property, information about the plaintiff's house being next to the Marine Aquarium Shop from 2005 - 10 (particular [3](i)), the names of the plaintiff's neighbours and the fact that the plaintiff is a ""Newcastle"" owner (although Newcastle is not referred to in the text of any of these six broadcasts).

10The defendants, in their written submissions in relation to earlier drafts of the statement of claim, could not have made their position clearer. As counsel for the defendants points out in her latest outline of submissions (at paragraph 9), the defendants seek a pleading where the plaintiff identifies the persons who identified the plaintiff (and how they did so) for each publication, so that they know the case they have to meet at trial.

11An additional complicating factor is that many of the imputations pleaded for each of these publications are either not conveyed at all, or are so defective in form that they must be repleaded. 

12The manner in which the particulars of identification are pleaded for the publications as a whole would require the striking out of the particulars, on this basis alone. There are additional problems in relation to each of the matters complained of, which the defendants submit militate against the granting of further leave to replead.

The first and second publications: ""Party Houses"", A Current Affair, 13 June 2012

13These identical publications (the first a broadcast, on 13 June 2012, the second online publication of the broadcast) show a series of quick shots of naked persons partying in different backyards, pools and homes.

14The imputations pleaded for the first and second publications are as follows:

2A. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was inconsiderate in permitting loud music, swearing, screaming, tenant aggression and nudity to take place at her ""Party house from hell"" during the entirety of weekends, every weekend, continuously for 48 hours, for many years, ""terrorising and scaring neighbours,"" and causing theft in neighbours houses and fist fights outside their houses.

2B. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was selfishly indifferent to the interests of her neighbours.

2C. The plaintiff circumvented the law in letting her house in ""a very quiet residential / suburban neighbourhood where only families were allowed"".

2D. The plaintiff was selfishly indifferent to community concerns.

2E. The plaintiff was callous in that she had little or no regard for local people in the interest of maximising profit from the deliberate and unlawful letting of her house for ""Bucks Parties"" every weekend in a ""Very quiet, residential, suburban neighbourhood on the exclusive Isle of Capri"". 

2F. The plaintiff was subjecting elderly neighbours to abuse.

2G. The plaintiff was running a nightclub nextdoor to neighbours in a very quiet, residential street.

2H. The plaintiff was subjecting neighbours to dangerous behaviour.

2I. The plaintiff was subjecting neighbours to nonstop loud music, adult behaviour and nudity right in their faces daily and continuously for 24 hours in a nonstop party nightmare.

2J. The plaintiff was depriving neighbours of a normal, suburban, happy, quiet, residential life.

2K. The plaintiff circumvented the law in ""operating a business in a quiet, residential street"".

2L. The plaintiff was trashing and devaluing neighbours' houses, so they could not even sell their houses, as the plaintiff gave the whole neighbourhood a notoriously bad name.

2M. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was ""The only rogue operator"" of the over 14000 holiday rental properties on the Gold Coast, and was the sole operator that was responsible for ruining the reputation of and destroying the entire holiday rental industry on the Gold Coast and all across Australia.

2N. The plaintiff was subjecting elderly neighbours to ""unfairness and frustration"" by ""non stop music and adult behaviour in their faces daily"".

15The defendants have helpfully summarised particulars of identification as follows:

Viewers

The viewers listed under the heading ""Particulars of Viewers"" on pp2-3;

""All of the plaintiff's patients"" (as per the attached list).

Extrinsic facts

1. Extensive video footage of the plaintiff's house is shown ([1](A));

2. The plaintiff's neighbours are interviewed ([1](B));

3. Some viewers has seen most of the ""Naked Neighbours"" and ""Party House"" ""Campaign"" on ""A Current Affair"", but were unaware that the plaintiff was the owner until she was ""named and shamed: by face on ""Party House Court"" on 5 June 2013 (p3, under item 35 in the section entitled ""Particulars of viewers"");

4. The plaintiff's house is situated at 15 Bundall Road, Surfers Paradise ([3](i));

5. The plaintiff's house is next door to a retail shop ""Marine Aquarium Shop"" run by the owner of 17 Bundall Road, Mr John Bee and Mr Michael Ryan, from at least 2005 to 2010 ([3](i));

6. The plaintiff let her house out for rental ([3](ii)(a));

7. The plaintiff was a ""Newcastle owner"" ([3](ii)(a));

8. The plaintiff's neighbours were Brian and Jeanette Climpson of 13 Bundall Road, Marilyn and John Bee and Michael Ryan of 17 Bundall Road and Adam and Karen Schuch of 67 Rapallo Avenue, Surfers Paradise ([3](ii)(b));

9. The house was identified by ""them"" by video of the house shown repeatedly on ""A Current Affair"" ([3](c)).

16I shall illustrate the problem by examining imputation (a). Imputation (a) refers to ""the party house from hell"" which was ""terrorising and scaring neighbours"" the neighbours. The inverted commas indicate a quote directly from the matter complained of, although these quotations do not appear in the matter complained of at all. This suggests that the plaintiff intends to add on material which is not in the matter complained of, but which comes from other (unspecified) sources, on the basis that some viewers saw those other broadcasts or online publications, and thus were able to identify the plaintiff as a result. 

17Leaving aside the undesirability of an imputation simply using the words of the matter complained of, the words in inverted commas do not appear in the matter complained of. The neighbours whose statements support this particular imputation are conceded by the plaintiff to be other neighbours, speaking about other ""party houses"". The circumstances in which the plaintiff claims her particular Gold Coast neighbours are known to, for example, her Newcastle patients, are not explained. Although the particulars of identification refer to the plaintiff as being identified as a ""Newcastle owner"", this phrase does not appear in the matter complained of.

18Similarly, imputations 2B and 2D, which assert selfish indifference of the plaintiff both to her neighbours and to the community, fail to identify the portions of the matter complained of where the plaintiff is identified as being guilty of this conduct. Imputation 2E, which uses the alternative formulation of being callous, includes an extensive quotation about the Isle of Capri which does not appear in these publications at all. 

19Imputation 2C was explained by Dr Ghosh to mean that she was accused of breaking the law. Leaving aside whether or not this is a correct definition of ""circumvented"", the clear message in these publications is that this conduct is currently within the law, but ought not to be, and no particulars of identification could overcome this problem.

20Imputation 2M, that the plaintiff was ""the only rogue operator"" of the over 14,000 Gold Coast holiday rental property and was the sole operator responsible for destroying the entire Gold Coast holiday industry, not only contains quotations which are not in the matter complained of but puts forward a meaning wholly inconsistent with the tenor of the publication, which is that the ""very lucrative short term holiday rental and party house situation right across Australia"" is sufficiently a problem to require legislation in Queensland and commentary from the Queensland Premier, Mr Newman. 

21Imputation 2G (that the plaintiff was running a nightclub) is pitched too high, and is not reasonably capable of being conveyed. No particulars of identification are provided which could support this imputation.

22An imputation of subjecting elderly neighbours to abuse (2F and 2N) might be capable of being conveyed, if the persons who saw the broadcast were able to identify one or more of the neighbours who are interviewed as being the neighbours of the plaintiff's house. The person who speaks these words, Margaret Rossi, is the journalist who is summarising the information she has obtained in the course of what is portrayed as an Australia-wide problem. However, the particulars to enable such identification are not pleaded (or alternatively are buried so deep in the maze of identification particulars that their nature is difficult to determine). The plaintiff has told the court that some of those interviewed at the commencement of the broadcast are neighbours in the houses adjoining her property, but their comments about these events, and the imputations which accordingly arise, need to be set out with the appropriate particulars of the persons who knew that these people were the plaintiff's neighbours, and/or that the footage shown in relation to those matters is footage of the plaintiff's house.

23In addition, the plaintiff pleads a second set of imputations which are common to all publications (set out below under the heading ""Imputations pleaded as 'common to all matters pleaded'""). These cannot be imputations arising from having seen all of the broadcasts and downloading all of the online publications because the nature of these publications does not fall within the limited circumstances in which such pleadings are permitted (Burrows v Knightley (1987) 10 NSWLR 651). In any event, many of these imputations do not differ in substance from the imputations already pleaded. The plaintiff told me they were intended as a summary of her case. They appear to have been copied from her 2010 Queensland Supreme Court proceedings. No particulars of identification are provided for this additional set of imputations. 

The third and fourth publications: ""Over the fence and out of control"", A Current Affair, 5 March 2013

24The imputations pleaded are:

8A. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was irresponsible in its letting to ""outrageous tenants making life a misery for decent neighbours"" twenty four hours a day.

8B. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was inconsiderate in permitting loud music, swearing, screaming, tenant aggression and nudity to take place at her ""Party house from hell"" during the entirety of weekends, every weekend, continuously for 48 hours, for four years, ""terrorising and scaring neighbours,"" especially the 89 year old, Jeanette Climpson, ""who lived all alone"" next door at 13 Bundall Road.

8C. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, wasselfishly indifferent to the interests of her neighbours.

8D. The plaintiff circumvented the law in letting her house in ""a very quiet residential / suburban neighbourhood on the Isle of Capri where only families were allowed"".

8E. The plaintiff made false and ridiculous allegations about the neighbours in a Queensland Court (committed Perjury) in malicious retribution for their honest complaints about the plaintiff's house.

8F. The plaintiff was selfishly indifferent to community concerns.

8G. The plaintiff was callous in that she had little or no regard for local people in the interest of maximising profit from the deliberate letting of her house as a ""Party House"" for ""24 hour Bucks Parties,"" making life a misery for pensioner neighbours.

8H. The plaintiff and her tenants were delusional in thinking they were ""above the law,"" when they were constantly breaking the law.

8I. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was responsible for ""disgraceful, out of control behaviour"" that was ""over the fence line,"" into the neighbours' properties.

25The same particulars of identification are provided as for the first and second matters complained of.

26The plaintiff's case in relation to the third and fourth publication is even weaker. The plaintiff's house is one of a series of property stills or short flashes shown in this 25-second advertisement for ""A Current Affair"". The plaintiff's summary of the matter complained of sets out its contents as three sentences concerning ""outrageous tenants making life a misery for retirees and their families"", and there is no reference to the property owners, or to their alleged wrongdoing, at all.

27It is unclear whether this advertisement was in fact available online (the fourth publication). The absence of an online site reference, or particulars of the persons who downloaded this advertisement, are additional problems.

The seventh and eighth publications: ""Party Houses a Big Pain on Gold Coast"", A Current Affair, 22 March 2013

28The imputations pleaded are:

20A. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was irresponsible in its letting.

20B. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was inconsiderate in permitting loud music, swearing, screaming, tenant aggression and nudity to take place at her ""Party house"" during the entirety of weekends, every weekend, continuously for 48 hours, for four years.

20C. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was selfishly indifferent to the interests of her neighbours.

20D. The plaintiff circumvented the law in letting her house in ""a very quiet residential / suburban neighbourhood on the Isle of Capri where only families were allowed"".

20E. The plaintiff was selfishly indifferent to community concerns.

20F. The plaintiff was callous in that she had little or no regard for local people in the interest of maximising profit from the deliberate letting of her house as a ""Party House"" for ""every weekend for four long years"".

29The viewers of the programme are identified under the same heading (""Specific viewers"" in the ""Particulars of viewers"" on pages 2-3 of the draft statement of claim) and the same extrinsic facts are identified as for the other matters complained of referred to above.

30These publications consist of a news item on NBN news on 22 March 2013 and its availability, since that time, on the Ninemsn website. The matter complained of describes complaints by the Member for Mermaid Beach, Mr Ray Stevens, that Council is ""stalling on a crackdown"" and on the need for change under the Planning Scheme. The countervailing opinion of the Mayor's office, namely that they had emailed proposed legislation changes to the State Government for legislation changes and that the ball is in their court, is then stated. There is no reference to the owners of any properties. Footage is shown very briefly of partying guests in properties, which footage the plaintiff tells me, from the bar table, includes shots of her property's backyard.

31From this short news item, despite the absence of any reference to homeowners letting these properties, the plaintiff has distilled a series of imputations in the same form as the first and second matters complained of, namely that the plaintiff was selfishly indifferent, callous, and ""circumventing the law in letting her house ""in a very quiet residential/suburban neighbourhood on the Isle of Capri where only families were allowed"" (imputation 20D). As is the case with the other portions of imputations in quotations in relation to this publication, none of these words appear in the matter complained of. 

32None of the particulars of identification could give rise to imputations of this kind. 

Conclusions concerning the failure to provide proper particulars of identification

33Counsel for the defendants concedes, and I agree, that courts will only strike out an action for defamation due to failure to provide proper particulars in the clearest of cases. She submits that this is such a case.

34The particulars self-evidently confusing and prolix. This problem could normally be overcome by granting leave to amend, but counsel for the defendants reminds me that this is the plaintiff's sixth draft pleading in a motion that has been before the court for six months. The defendants still have no idea of the case they have to meet, and have been left to guess both the nature and extent of the case as pleaded.

35In extreme cases, where a party repeatedly fails to plead and particularise a case in accordance with court orders, the result may be loss of the action in its entirety. In McGrane v Channel 7 Brisbane Pty Ltd [2012] QSC 133 at [50] - [54], Daubney J struck out the entire proceedings, in circumstances where there had been less delay than the present, stating:

""[50] I am very conscious of the well established proposition that the ""exercise of power to summarily terminate proceedings must always be attended with caution"". 

[51] It is also necessary for me to consider the interests of defendants, who are impelled to incur costs as a consequence of the commencement and service of proceedings, and the interests of the court which, as a public institution, must ensure that its necessarily limited resources are utilised efficiently and in accordance with the underlying philosophy expressed in UCPR r 5.

[52] This plaintiff has had numerous opportunities to present an intelligible case. He has failed to do so. Indeed, his claim has gone from being ludicrous to ridiculous.

[53] In my opinion, the plaintiff has squandered his opportunities to present a proper, comprehensible claim. I see no reason why the defendant should be put to further cost or why the court should be expected to devote further resources to this matter.""

36The defendants have asked me to take this step in these proceedings as well, and have drawn my attention both to the principles enunciated by Daubney J and to recent similar decisions in New South Wales, including Al-Shennag v Woodcock [2013] NSWSC 696, where McCallum J, in the course of striking out the plaintiff's proceedings, noted at [16] that there had been no evidence at the s 7A trial that the matter complained of had been published to anyone with knowledge of the extrinsic facts. Her Honour's concern was that the costs of the litigation would be disproportionate to the damages awarded (at [111]). Her Honour went on to conclude:

""[110] The present case is unusual in that the plaintiff has not been dilatory. However, the discretion conferred by the rule is not confined to cases of delay caused by inaction. The prejudice faced by Mr Woodcock is that he must remain active in litigation which is slow to be brought to finality, not for want of any activity on the part of Mr Al-Shennag, but for want of any constructive activity. The prejudice of being required to face Mr Al-Shennag's numerous specious claims and allegations is manifest. As noted in Micallef, the rule contemplates the possible termination of a case without determination of an issue between the parties.

[111] In the present case, there is a more compelling reason for taking that course than in the case of mere dilatoriness. In my view, there is a substantial risk that, even assuming the plaintiff is successful, the costs of the action have already become disproportionate to any award of damages Mr Al-Shennag may receive. The claim for economic loss is substantial but most probably ambitious. Leaving that part of the claim aside, and for present purposes disregarding the defences, the cost of the ill-conceived applications Mr Al-Shennag has lost along the way is not warranted by any likely award of general damages for defamation and thereby offends the proportionality of costs principle enshrined in s 60 of the Civil Procedure Act.""

37Both these cases involved litigants in person, who are afforded a degree of assistance and flexibility to enable them to prepare and present their case. Counsel for the defendant reminds me that determining these issues has required not only a series of hearings over the past six months, but analysis of hundreds of pages of pleadings and particulars over that period and a series of hearings to ventilate the issues, without the plaintiff getting any closer to the issues.

38There can be little doubt as to the course which would be taken if a legal practitioner made multiple amendment applications of this kind. In Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corp [2008] NSWCA 37 at [24], [34] and [35], and again in McMahon v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 308, the NSW Court of Appeal warned that there was a limit to the number of times that a party should be permitted to amend defamation proceedings. Counsel for the defendants submits that the plaintiff was given a final opportunity to amend her statement of claim after a series of poorly drafted claim. She has squandered that opportunity, and her whole claim should be struck out.

39Where a plaintiff is not named in the matter complained of, and doubt remains concerning whether the plaintiff is identified (Al-Shennag v Woodcock, supra, at [16] per McCallum J) there must be concern as to whether the litigation in question is proportionate in accordance with the principles set out in s 60 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) (Al-Shennag v Woodcock, supra, at [111]). There have been examples in England where determination that the action had become an abuse of process is against a background where rulings on meaning are given, as it may be possible to show that the proceedings would not achieve anything of practical utility for the claimant: Cammish v Hughes [2012] EWCA Civ 1655 at [60]; Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc v Aviation News Ltd & Anor [2013] EWHC 1505 (QB) at [142]-[144]. Those cases must be viewed with caution because Article 10 European Convention of Human Rights requirements have no place in Australian defamation law. However, while it has traditionally been the case that a plaintiff need only establish that one person saw, heard or read the matter complained of, decisions such as Al-Shennag v Woodcock, supra, show the increasing concern of the courts to take into account principles of proportionality, particularly having regard to the capped nature of general damages for defamation.

40In Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 335 (""Younan""), the Court of Appeal notes that a plaintiff must establish that ""at least some readers of the article"" (at [15]) were aware of the particularised extrinsic facts and, in addition, that those persons were ""ordinary sensible readers"" who could reasonably have come to that conclusion (at [17]), citing Steele v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1974] 2 NSWLR 348.

41The factual circumstances in Younan were in some way similar to the present, in that the question of ownership of a particular property was the issue. However, Younan differs from the present case in three significant respects. The first is that the matter complained of in Younan related to one property, a boarding house, which had been the subject of extensive publicity following residents' deaths. The new owners were not named in the matter complained of, and the trial judge had wrongly accepted the argument that those who did know of their identity would also have known sufficient factual information to be aware that they had not been the owners of the time, this being the basis upon which identification was held not to have been established for one of the plaintiffs in Warren v Maxwell-Smith. 

42In the present case, the identification is much weaker because it involves more than one property in more than one location, and the identification of the property consists essentially of pool party footage. The plaintiff has failed to specify with any clarity how she was identified (for example, by recognition of her swimming pool by persons who had visited the property and knew it was owned by her). This is particularly a problem for the second and third publications, where only brief flashing scenes of partygoers are shown, in the context of what is described as a geographically widespread problem. 

43The second problem is that the plaintiff in Younan put forward alternative formulations of particulars of identification which the Court of Appeal considered capable of surviving the relatively low bar required of an identifying reader or viewer (at [25]). 

44Thirdly, the imputations pleaded related that factor of identification into imputations capable of being conveyed. That is not the case here. On these three bases, Younan can be distinguished.

45It might be said that, somewhere in the particulars, there must be one person who could be taken to have seen one or more of the matters complained of and identified the plaintiff. Is it enough for one person to identify the plaintiff? That used to be the situation where s 7A jury trials determined all issues relevant to publication, including defamation. However, doubt was cast on this practice by Maxwell-Smith v Warren [2007] NSWCA 270, where witnesses gave evidence both at the s 7A hearing and separate trial that they identified one or both of the plaintiffs who commenced proceedings for a defamatory book of cartoons about the conduct of a case by unnamed lawyers. The defendants, who had lost that litigation, created a cartoon book of the case which they sold door-to-door in the small country towns where the plaintiffs were in business as a firm of solicitors. Identification evidence included another solicitor who purchased the book, the wife of one of the plaintiffs (who saw the book for sale at a weekend fair) and friends of both plaintiffs who were offered the book for sale or saw it for sale. 

46Basten JA rejected these witnesses' identifications of each of the plaintiffs as insufficient; although it amounted to identification of the respective plaintiffs as individuals, ""it may be doubted whether such extrinsic facts would have been widely known, even in a small community"" (at [45]) and amounted to identification of the law firm rather than the individual plaintiffs. Although Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd does not refer to Maxwell-Smith v Warren, the Court's discussion of the principles for establishing identification does not suggest the existence of any such additional requirement. 

47Accordingly, if the plaintiff had been able to set out in her particulars that a named person watched or downloaded any of these publications, and identified the plaintiff by reason of some reasonably based specific piece of information, that would have been sufficient. Unfortunately, this has not been done. It is necessary to set these apparently conflicting decisions out in some detail because Younan v Nationwide News Pty Ltd was handed down the day after I made rulings in these proceedings. As it happened, the defendants in these proceedings addressed me in accordance with the accepted principles espoused in Younan, as opposed to the additional requirements set out in Maxwell-Smith v Warren. 

48The plaintiff's continued failure to plead and particularise her case in clear and simple language is difficult to comprehend. It is as if she wishes to cloak these particulars in secrecy so that she can elect how to plead identification at the trial. The defendants' legal practitioners have gone out of their way to assist the plaintiff by providing clear submissions and by meeting the requests of the plaintiff for copies of the matters complained of and by meeting her requests for further time to amend, including the request that this latest application be heard in Newcastle to suit the plaintiff's convenience, although defamation proceedings should in fact be case-managed in the Sydney registry. This is not a case where the opposing party should bear any of the blame for the repeated delays in preparation and presentation of the plaintiff's pleadings, which is of significance since the defendants now submit that they plaintiff should not be given a further opportunity to replead identification.

49The plaintiff has explained to me her wish to represent herself, and to plead her case as she sees fit. Having heard her submissions, I am of the view that there is no likelihood that fresh pleadings will cure the defects I have outlined above, for the same reasons as those expressed by McCallum J in Al-Shennag v Woodcock, supra, at [110].

50It was for these reasons that I struck out the first to fourth and seventh to eighth claims in the course of the hearing on 10 October 2013.

51Having set out my findings in relation to these claims, I next consider the issues of form and capacity of the imputations in the remaining four publications, namely the fifth, sixth, ninth and tenth matters complained of.

The fifth and sixth matters complained of: ""Party House Misery"", A Current Affair, 5 March 2013

52The plaintiff is named in the fifth and sixth matters complained of, which consist of the television programme and online publications. No objection to the particulars of identification arise and no extrinsic facts are pleaded.

53The imputations pleaded are as follows:

14A. The plaintiff, as a ""Newcastle"" home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was irresponsible in its letting, in deliberately booking continuous twenty four hour ""Bucks Parties"" every weekend for four long years.

14B. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was inconsiderate in permitting loud music, swearing, screaming, tenant aggression and nudity to take place at her ""Party house"" during the entirety of weekends, every weekend, continuously for 48 hours, for four years, ""terrorising and scaring neighbours,"" especially the 89 year old, Jeanette Climpson, ""who lived all alone"" next door at 13 Bundall Road.

14C. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was selfishly indifferent to the interests of her neighbours, who had become ""prisoners in their own homes"".

14D. The plaintiff circumvented the law in letting her house in ""a very quiet residential / suburban neighbourhood on the Isle of Capri where only families were allowed"".

14E. The plaintiff made false and ridiculous allegations about the neighbours in a Queensland Court (committed Perjury) in malicious retribution for their honest complaints about the plaintiff's house.

14F. The plaintiff was selfishly indifferent to community concerns, and had insulted the exclusive community where parties were not allowed by law.

14G. The plaintiff was callous in that she had little or no regard for local people in the interest of maximising profit from the deliberate letting of her house as a ""Party House"" for ""Bucks Parties"" ""every weekend for four long years"".

14H. The plaintiff was knowingly permitting criminal behaviour to continue in her house, although police were called multiple times.

14I. The plaintiff defied the law by booking ""Bucks Parties"" in her house every weekend, even after new ""noise laws"" were passed by the Queensland Government.

14J. The plaintiff had shown disrespect to elderly neighbours.

14K. The plaintiff was guilty of ""inviting everyone"" to her house, not screening tenants for suitable behaviour.

14L. The plaintiff was ruining and devaluing neighbours houses.

14M. The plaintiff was allowing her tenants to ""trash the homes"" of her neighbours, while the plaintiff falsely accused neighbours of ""trashing her home"" in Court.

14N. The plaintiff had turned a ""quiet and peaceful neighbourhood"" into a ""nonstop party nightmare,"" to ""torment and terrorise neighbours"" with constant full nudity and criminal behaviour in ""full view of neighbours, right in their faces"".

14O. The plaintiff was responsible for sleep deprivation, anger and mental illness to her neighbours.

14P. The plaintiff was inconsiderate to neighbours and circumvented the law in allowing ""near naked women"" and ""drunk men"" ""in full view of the neighbours"" in the pool area and inside her house.

54The same imputations are pleaded (at paragraphs numbered 17A - 17P) for the online publication. For convenience, I will deal with the imputations in groups.

55The principles upon which form and capacity must be determined are set out in Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 as clarified, in relation to the uniform legislation by the NSW Court of Appeal. The test for a capacity argument is a low one, and courts should be reluctant to strike out an imputation other than in a clear case: Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 18. That is particularly the case where the matter complained of is a television broadcast, where the transient nature and fleeting images of the broadcast may be more likely to be conveyed, especially if the subject matter is sensational (such as the depiction of near-naked partygoers).

Imputations 14A, 14C, 14H

56For the reasons I gave in the course of the hearing, I am satisfied that imputations that the plaintiff was irresponsible, as well as selfishly indifferent to the concerns of her neighbours as well as to the community, are conveyed. These imputations will go to the jury.

Imputations 14B, 14G, 14K,14N

57Each of these imputations restates, with little variation, the same material as imputations 14A and/or 14C. Imputations 14B and 14N each suffer from the additional problem that they are ""rolled up"" and convey more than one imputation, namely the contents of imputations 14A and 14C. These imputations are accordingly struck out.

Imputations 14L and 14O

58These imputations are struck out with leave to replead, for reasons of form. Imputation 14L should specify the conduct which amounted to ruining and devaluing neighbours' houses. Imputation 14O should identify the basis upon which the plaintiff's conduct is irresponsible.

Imputations 14D, 14E, 14F, 14I, 14J, 14M

59I have found that each of these imputations is not conveyed.

60Imputation 14D, 14F and 14P suffer from the same defect, namely that the plaintiff circumvented (which the plaintiff told me she intended to mean ""broke"") the law by letting her house at all (14D) and inconsiderately to neighbours let it to near-naked women and drunk men. Imputation 14F specifically states that the plaintiff had insulted ""the exclusive community where parties were not allowed by law"".

61Nothing could be clearer, from the matter complained of, than that the letting of these premises is perfectly legal: ""there's no law stopping these holiday rentals"" (page 2 of Exhibit C). The complaint of the broadcast is that the law should be changed so as to prevent short-term lettings of this kind. In those circumstances, imputations of breaking (or circumventing) the law cannot be conveyed. Similarly, imputation 14I, which asserts that the plaintiff ""defied the law"" by booking these noisy parties every weekend, cannot be conveyed.

62Imputation 14E asserts that the plaintiff committed perjury in malicious retribution against her neighbours' honest complaints. There are two references to a court case in the matter complained. The first refers to the neighbours being ""dragged through court by the owner of this house"" following which the parties ""seemed to die down a bit"". The second refers to the ""Newcastle owner"" ""has fired back, taking many in the street to court"" in ""retaliation to years of neighbour complaints"" (page 4 of Exhibit C). An imputation of perjury and malicious retribution is pitched too high and is therefore not conveyed. For similar reasons, imputation 14M is not conveyed. There is no basis for asserting that the plaintiff was knowingly allowing her tenants to trash the homes of her neighbours.

63Imputation 14J asserts that the plaintiff had shown disrespect to elderly neighbours. The matter complained of describes the drunken tenants as terrorising the neighbours, including the elderly, but does not ascribe this conduct to the plaintiff personally. This imputation is not conveyed.

64The plaintiff has been granted leave to replead accordingly.

65I make the same orders mutatis mutandis for the sixth matter complained of.

The ninth and tenth matters complained of: ""Party House Court"", A Current Affair, 5 June 2013

66The imputations pleaded by the plaintiff are as follows:

26A. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was inconsiderate in permitting loud music, swearing, screaming, tenant aggression and nudity to take place at her ""Party house from hell"" during the entirety of weekends, every weekend, continuously for 48 hours, for many years, ""terrorising"" and scaring neighbours.

26B. The plaintiff was selfishly indifferent to community concerns.

26C. The plaintiff as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was circumventing the law in running a commercial business in a purely residential area, on a very quiet street.

26D. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was irresponsible in its letting.

26E. The plaintiff was callous in that she had little or no regard for local people in the interest of maximising profit from the deliberate and unlawful letting of her house for ""Bucks Parties"" every weekend in a ""Very quiet, residential, suburban neighbourhood where only families were allowed"" but the plaintiff was not advertising or renting out to families.

26F. The plaintiff made false and ridiculous allegations about the neighbours in both Queensland and NSW Courts (committed Perjury) in malicious retribution for their honest complaints about the plaintiff's house.

26G. The plaintiff and the entire legal and court system in Australia were all guilty for letting the innocent victim neighbours be subject to a court trial.

26H. The plaintiff was callous in subjecting neighbours to nonstop loud music, adult behaviour and nudity right in their faces daily and continuously for 24 hours in a nonstop party nightmare.

26I. The plaintiff was a constant, vexatious litigator harassing her law abiding neighbours with multiple identical court cases across different states until she manipulated and forced the verdict she wanted.

26J. The plaintiff was the real criminal, and committed a crime by photographing the third defendant outside the Newcastle Court House, and was charged by two security officers as a criminal and caught on camera by the third defendant as proof.

26K. The plaintiff falsely alleged she was a victim, when the neighbours are the real victims.

26L. The plaintiff was a lunatic, mentally deranged woman, answering the third defendant's honest, fair, unbiased and factual questions with incoherent and irrelevant ""bizarre rants"".

26M. The plaintiff circumvented the law by running a nightclub nextdoor to neighbours in a very quiet, residential street.

26N. The plaintiff was cowardly in ""hiding in court for forty minutes"" to escape commenting on the false allegations she had made about her victim neighbours in Court.

26O. The plaintiff had escalated what should have been a ""backyard battle"" to court action, in an abuse and manipulation of the court system.

26P. The plaintiff's was inconsiderate in not allowing her neighbours to extract a ""pound of flesh"" from the plaintiff's body, in an honest ""backyard battle"" for all the ""abuse"" and false allegations she had put them through.

26Q. The plaintiff was not entitled to justice, law and order or even court action as the plaintiff was a constant vexatious litigator and a lunatic.

26R. The plaintiff was initially telling lies to hide evidence of constant 24 hour ""Bucks Parties"" at her house, but changed her story to a ""bizarre rant"" when confronted with proper video evidence.

26S. The plaintiff was a cruel, evil, selfishly indifferent doctor and human being, callous in the greedy pursuit of profit.

26T. The plaintiff could not be a good doctor, as she was incoherent, and crazy, speaking in ""a bizarre rant"".

26U. The plaintiff had given her house a notoriously bad reputation, by deliberately advertising and letting the house for ""Bucks Parties"" and not for ""families"".

26V. Retail shops and businesses were allowed in the white neighbours houses (in the same zoning) but a holiday rental was not allowed in the black plaintiff's house.

26W. The plaintiff could not be a good doctor, as she was fraudulently using a disabled driver's permit.

26X. The plaintiff was knowingly permitting criminal behaviour to continue in her house, although police were called multiple times.

26Y. The plaintiff was a lunatic, with a ridiculously long list of innocent victim defendants.

26Z. The plaintiff was inconsiderate in not obeying her neighbours commands that her tenants were not allowed to use her pool area semi-naked as in every other pool in Australia, but would have to be fully dressed in the pool area as well as inside the plaintiff's house, as the plaintiff's tenants were not entitled to any privacy, as the neighbours could film them naked inside the house and Channel Nine would show these videos repeatedly on primetime national television, and post them on the world wide web.

67I shall set out these imputations in groups.

Imputations 26B, 26D, 26H, 26I, 26K, 26N, 26R, 26X

68For the reasons given in the course of the hearing before me, these imputations are reasonably capable of being conveyed and will go to the jury. The inverted commas must be deleted from imputation 26N.

Imputations 26C, 26E, 26F, 26G, 26M, 26P, 26Q, 26S, 26T, 26V, 26W, 26Y, 26Z 

69Imputations 26C, 26E, 26M and 26V all refer to the letting of the house as having been done unlawfully. As is the case with the other publications, the matter complained of does not assert that the letting is unlawful; it asserts that the law should be changed. In addition, imputation 26E does not differ in substance from imputation 26B.

70Imputation 26F asserts perjury by the plaintiff in malicious retribution for her neighbours' honest complaints. There is no allegation of perjury. The imputation is that her neighbours are sick and tired of her taking them to court.

71Imputation 26P, that the plaintiff is inconsiderate in not allowing her neighbours to extract a ""pound of flesh"", does not arise because this imputation is not conveyed by the matter complained of. This is one of a series of imputations which the plaintiff claimed could arise from material on the website. I could not find that material but, even if I had been able to, it would not be available to plead in relation to the broadcast. Whether it is available in relation to the online publication will depend upon whether the plaintiff brings a strike-in application to add these comments.

72Imputation 26Q, that the plaintiff was not entitled to justice because she was a constant vexatious litigator and a lunatic, is rolled up, and the imputation that she is a lunatic is not conveyed. The same is the case for imputation 26Y. Imputation 26 T correctly refers to the fact that the matter complained of asserted that the plaintiff made ""a bizarre rant"", but an imputation that she could not be a good doctor is not, without more, conveyed. 

73Imputation 26S and imputation 26Z contain multiple rolled-up meanings. Imputation 26Z is incomprehensible. Both these imputations are accordingly struck out.

The remaining imputations

74Imputations 26A, 26J and 26L are struck out with leave to replead, for the reasons that are set out in the relevant orders set out below. Imputation 26O does not differ in substance from imputation 26I and imputation 26U is struck out as not differing in substance from imputation 26D.

75The same rulings are made mutatis mutandis for the tenth matter complained of, which is the online version of the broadcast. If the plaintiff wishes to rely upon additional imputations being conveyed in the tenth matter complained of by reason of viewer comments, those viewer comments must be the subject of a ""strike in"" application. I have granted her leave to do this in order 7. In addition, for all online publications, the plaintiff must provide the appropriate details of online publication addresses.

Imputations pleaded as 'common to all matters pleaded'


76The plaintiff pleaded the following imputations to as arising from each matter complained of:

3A. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was inconsiderate in permitting loud music, swearing, screaming, tenant aggression and nudity to take place at her ""Party house from hell"" during the entirety of weekends, every weekend, continuously for 48 hours, for many years, ""terrorising"" and scaring neighbours.

3B. The plaintiff was selfishly indifferent to community concerns.

3C. The plaintiff as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was circumventing the law in running a commercial business in a purely residential area, on a very quiet street.

3D. The plaintiff, as a home owner in the business of letting her house for rental, was irresponsible in its letting.

3E. The plaintiff was callous in that she had little or no regard for local people in the interest of maximising profit from the deliberate and unlawful letting of her house for ""Bucks Parties"" every weekend in a ""Very quiet, residential, suburban neighbourhood where only families were allowed"" but the plaintiff was not advertising or renting out to families.

3F. The plaintiff made false and ridiculous allegations about the neighbours in both Queensland and NSW Courts (committed Perjury) in malicious retribution for their honest complaints about the plaintiff's house.

77For the reasons set out at above, and in accordance with the principles set out in Burrows v Knightley, supra, the plaintiff is not entitled to plead an additional set of imputations for each of the matters complained of, or as arising from the whole series of matters complained of. These imputations are struck out.

Application to strike out portions of the pleadings pursuant to UCPR r 14.28

78The draft statement of claim contains material which is irrelevant and/or unrelated to the publication of the matters complained of. I have struck out a series of paragraphs and set out briefly my reasons for doing so below.

(a) The second sentence of paragraph 1: ""The plaintiff's house is repeatedly shown in video footage of an old November 2011 video and referred to as a ""party house and business in a residential area.""""

79All particulars of identification should have been placed in one section, not in different parts of the statement of claim. As I have struck out the claims for which particulars of identification are required, this sentence is now surplusage.

(b) All particulars of identification, including: (a) Particulars on page 1; (b) The particulars of viewers on page 2 from the heading ""specific viewers"" to ""10,000 viewers"" (page 3); (c) Particulars of extrinsic facts on pages 5-7, as well as the ""summary of imputations common to all matters pleaded"" on page 7.

80See [79] above.

(c) The second sentence on page 8, commencing ""the plaintiff's house""

81See [79] above.

(d) The reference to the number of viewers on the A Current Affair website on page 10.

82Particulars of the number of viewers on this website generally are irrelevant to the issue of the number of persons who viewed the matter complained of. Any relevance they have to damages is an issue for the trial, not for inclusion in the statement of claim.

(e) The sentence on page 13 commencing ""the programme stated"" and the reference on page 14 to the number of viewers of A Current Affair.

83See [84] above.

(f) The contents of paragraph 27, which may be repleaded.

84This is one of a series of paragraphs relevant to financial loss. This must be pleaded with specific reference to actual financial loss and should not include references to statements made to the plaintiff in the street, claims for breach of privacy or references to her son.

(g) The reference to the ""unauthorised video of the plaintiff"" from the words ""it includes... disabled driver's permit"", and the similar passages on page 26 of the current version of the statement of claim (and page 20, paragraph 25) and page 26 (paragraph 30).""

85See [86] above.

Defendants' application for costs to be payable forthwith

86Costs of a motion await the final judgment of all issues between the parties: UCPR Pt 42 r 42.7. There is a presumption against the making of an order for costs payable forthwith. Costs issues are generally resolved at the end of the litigation, when the rights of the parties can best be determined: Brasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 571 at [13] per Emmett J (concerning Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3).

87This is also the case in defamation proceedings: Palace Films Pty Ltd v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 962 at [22] - [24] per McCallum J. (See also Gatley on Libel and Slander, 10th edition, at [35.15], citing Ritter v Godfrey [1920] 2 KB 47 at 53 per Lord Sterndale MR). McCallum J identified three factors warranting an order for payment of costs forthwith: the completion of a part of the litigation (in those proceedings, the abandonment of a breach of confidence claim), the conduct of the case, and the fact that there is ""much to come"" in proceedings which will take a long time to be finally disposed of (at [23]).

88These policy considerations and issues have been comprehensively reviewed by the NSW Court of Appeal in Griffith v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (No 2) [2011] NSWCA 142, where a plaintiff who succeeded on a justification defence (but lost the action) was nevertheless refused the substantial costs ($300,000) of successfully defeating the justification defence at the trial. 

89In Bevillesta Pty Ltd v D Tannous No 2 Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 277, the Court of Appeal noted the circumstances in which costs payable forthwith orders were made both before and after the Civil Procedure Act (at [29] - [37]). The court noted that prima facie, such an order was appropriate, and went on to consider whether the trial judge had properly taken into account the relevant discretionary issues. One of those, I note, is the relevance of the financial situation of a party (although in those circumstances the party in parlous circumstances was the party seeking the order), a factor the plaintiff raised with me. Although the Court of Appeal appears to have considered that this was not a relevant factor, it would be reasonable for any court to take into account that an order for costs payable forthwith might stifle the proceedings, and the Court of Appeal does not appear to say anything to the contrary of this.

90In considering whether to make an order for costs to be assessed forthwith, the court should be guided by the principles set out in ss 56 and 58(1) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and in particular:

(a)The costs rules, notably UCPR Pt 42 r 42.7;

(b)The degree of expedition with which the parties have approached the proceedings, including compliance with interlocutory activities (s 58(2)(ii)) and the principles in s 56. Since this matter has a trial date in October, this would include readiness for hearing;

(c)The use that any party has made, or could have made, of any opportunity available in the course of the proceedings (s 58(2)(v)). (A belated application to vary a costs order was refused in Aktas v Westpac Banking Corp Ltd (No 2) (2010) 241 CLR 570; [2010] HCA 47);

(d)The need for finality in litigation: Habib v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 291 at [50].

91The plaintiff could have set out her pleadings in these proceedings in the same clear way that her statement of claim in the Queensland Supreme Court was drafted. She has had many opportunities to redraft her pleadings, and the exemplary consideration shown to her by counsel and the solicitors representing her opponents throughout this litigation should have made this task easy for her. The process of arriving at a pleading in manageable form has been extended and difficult. The plaintiff has placed a burden on the resources of the defendants over a six-month period, Mrs Barnett submits, and the hearing is still a long way off (Palace Films Pty Ltd v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd, supra, at [23]).

92Mrs Barnett's submission that all costs should be payable forthwith would, however, stultify the litigation. However, given the exceptional amount to time that this application has taken, a limited order for costs payable forthwith should be made. Mrs Barnett's ""fall back"" position was for such an order to be made in relation to the costs of the 10 October 2013 hearing in Newcastle, a proposal which I considered fair and reasonable, given the amount of time, preparation and travelling involved.

93Accordingly, the costs order I made on 10 October 2013 was for the costs of the 10 October 2013 hearing, including the preparation costs, to be payable forthwith; the remaining costs of these defendants will await the resolution of these proceedings, which are now returned to the Sydney registry for further case management in the Defamation List on 1 November 2013.

		11 September 2014",2013-10-09 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706039,R v FEW [2013] NSWSC 1486,"Judgment
1FULLERTON J:  On 8 October 2013 the accused was arraigned on a charge that on 1 April 2011 he murdered Child X to which he entered a plea of not guilty.  With the consent of the parties the trial is proceeding before me without a jury.
2It is the Crown case that the deceased child (aged 2½ at the date of her death) died from a head injury comprised of a fracture of the occipital bone at the base of the skull with an associated bilateral subdural haemorrhage and brain swelling.  That is not in contest.  It is also common ground that the nature of the head injury was such that the child would have experienced a significant alteration of consciousness from the moment she sustained the injury because of the associated traumatic injury to the cerebrum, brain stem and cerebellum revealed on post-mortem and disclosed in a CT scan performed whilst the child was alive.  It is for this reason that the evidence leaves no room for doubt that the head injury, whether inflicted deliberately or sustained accidentally, was suffered between 10.01am and 10.21am on 30 March 2011.  At 10.01am the child was seen sitting upright in her pram and capable of responsive movement, and within minutes of 10.21am she was in a severely compromised state of orientation and consciousness when the child's mother attended at the accused's home having been notified by telephone that the child had fallen.
3What is in contest is whether the fatal head injury was deliberately inflicted by the accused or accidentally sustained when, on the accused's case, the child fell from a pram.  As I understand it, the evidence from a number of expert witnesses intended to be called by the Crown and by the accused later in the trial, is to the effect that it is not possible to determine from the appearance of the head injuries whether they were accidentally sustained or deliberately inflicted, although the probabilities, even the strong probabilities, on my reading of the reports, would seem to favour the latter.  For this reason, the circumstances of the injury and, in particular, the postulated but unwitnessed event relied upon by the accused, namely a fall from the pram at a maximum height of 1.5 metres, have been subjected to analysis from a range of perspectives, including biomechanics, neuropathology and radiology.  These investigations were undertaken with a view to the Crown excluding the reasonable possibility that the fatal injury was accidental or, to put it another way, to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the injuries were deliberately inflicted by the accused. 
4The Crown also relies upon multiple sites of significant bruising on various parts of the child's body, identified on post-mortem, in further support of the Crown case that the fatal head injury was not accidental.  As I understand the Crown case, the nature and extent of this bruising, and the number of separate areas of the child's body over which the bruising extended, excludes any reasonable possibility that any of them were sustained accidentally.  For present purposes, the secondary areas of bruising include extensive bruising to the scalp (revealed when the scalp was reflected at autopsy), with maximal involvement of large areas of the forehead anteriorly and the posterior aspect on the left side of the head with only minimal areas of bruising laterally; bilateral bruising to the ears; bruising of both buttocks (predominantly involving the left buttock with the grouping of the bruises resembling a handprint) and an area of bruising on the left thigh posteriorly, which, on dissection, revealed bruising passing to the level of the musculature.
5It is also the Crown case that the weight of the evidence adduced, and to be adduced in the trial, removes any reasonable possibility that these areas of secondary bruising were deliberately inflicted by anyone other than the accused.  
6While the Crown accepts that the bruising cannot be aged, the evidence of the child's mother is to the effect that, at the very least, the injuries to the child's buttocks must have been sustained at some time after 27 March 2011.  She gave evidence that when she bathed the child at the accused's home that day, after which she returned the child to the accused's care and control where the child remained up to and including the time she suffered the head injury on the morning of 30 March 2011, she did not see any on the child's buttocks or her trunk.  She said the only injury she noticed was a bruise on the child's thigh (between the buttock and the knee) in the shape of a 10 or 20 cent piece which she regarded as unexceptional since her daughter was an active and energetic toddler.  Although the child's mother was unable to say with any certainty whether the bruise was on the left or the right thigh, it would appear to be common ground that the cutaneous presentation of that bruise could not account for the deep subcutaneous bruising to the left thigh revealed on autopsy.  I note that the evidence is silent as to whether she washed the child's hair or attended with any particularity to the child's forehead or ears when she bathed her.
7The child's mother also gave evidence that in the week preceding 30 March 2011 she visited the child at the accused's home on a daily, or twice daily basis and, aside from seeing a mark of the child's forehead where she had run into a hall table in the accused's home, she saw no other signs of injury and her daughter did not complain of injury.  She said that she changed the child's nappy six or seven times in that week, and aside from nappy rash which she treated topically, she did not observe anything out of the ordinary on the child's buttocks or trunk. 
8It is the accused's case that he did not deliberately inflict any of the secondary injuries and, to extent that the medical evidence establishes that any of them were deliberately inflicted, they must have been inflicted by the child's mother, or her boyfriend, since they were the only adults who had access to the child in the week preceding her death, when he was not also in their company when they visited the child at his home.  The child's mother gave evidence that she took the child to the playground and to various food outlets with her boyfriend on her return from Brisbane on 23 March 2011 on multiple occasions the following week after which she returned the child to the accused's care and control. 
9In support of this aspect of the accused's case, Ms Yehia, senior counsel for the accused, served a tendency notice under s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995.  The tendency, the subject of the notice, is said to be the tendency of the child's mother to behave in a violent manner with physical violence being directed against herself and others.  That tendency was particularised by reference to a number of documents annexed to the notice in the form of reports to the Department of Family and Community Services under s 29 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998.  The tendency of the child's mother to act in a violent manner was refined by Ms Yehia in the course of argument to be a tendency to display violent behaviour where the mother is frustrated or otherwise feels out of control.  
10The evidence of violent behaviour in the past and sought to be elicited as tendency evidence is as follows:(a)  In July and September 2008 the child's mother disclosed that after heated arguments with the child's father she punched walls and a cupboard door;
(b)  On 30 January 2011 the child's mother lost control and punched her mother to the face causing bruising at a time when her mother was in a wheelchair - the deceased child was reportedly a witness to that incident;
(c)  In February 2011 the child's mother tightened the straps on the child's pram to restrain the child at which time she stated she did not care how tight the straps were or if they bruised the child.  On another occasion, at about the same time, she physically pushed the child back into the pram by holding her face or placing her hand over the child's face and forcefully pushing her backwards into the pram.
11I accept that the identity of the person who inflicted the secondary injuries (or at least those ultimately shown to have been deliberately inflicted in the context of the medical evidence to be led later in the trial) is a fact in issue in the trial given the significance of those injuries to the way the Crown seeks to exclude, as a reasonable possibility, that the fatal injury was sustained accidentally.  
12Ms Yehia submitted that the evidence particularised in the tendency notice reveals, in its terms, that the child's mother has a tendency to act violently in given circumstances (whether out of frustration or where she lacks control in a situation) and that she does so irrespective of the vulnerability of those she treats in that way.  Her mother was wheelchair-bound when she was punched to the face and her daughter was a 2 year old when she was forcibly restrained in her pram by her mother, indifferent to whether the child was hurt in the process.  Ms Yehia submitted that conduct, in a concentrated period of weeks prior to the child's death, bears relevantly upon the fact in issue in the trial (in the sense that it could rationally effect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue) not as providing a link in the process of proving that the child's mother was in fact the person who inflicted the secondary injuries, but because the evidence was capable of undermining (or raising a material doubt) as to that part of the Crown case which seeks to prove that the accused was the person who inflicted the secondary injuries. 
13Ms Yehia submitted that other evidence in the trial would establish that the child was in her mother's exclusive care and control (subject only to the presence of her boyfriend) on multiple occasions after her return from Brisbane and before 30 March 2011, and that injuries, even significant injuries of the kind relied upon the Crown, may well have been inflicted at that time when the child, who the mother described as hyperactive and ""a wild child"", was misbehaving or resisting her mother's attempts at discipline and control.  
14Ms Yehia submitted that the evidence also met the requirement of significant probative value in s 97(1)(b) that being the only prerequisite to admissibility under the Evidence Act where the evidence is tendered by an accused.   
15In that regard she submitted that it was sufficient that I consider that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability that someone other than the accused inflicted the secondary injuries to an significant extent (that is, that the evidence is capable of having that impact) and that I caution myself against making any assessment as to whether the evidence will ultimately have this effect when I come to consider whether the evidence establishes the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.  I also caution myself against engaging in any assessment of the reliability or credibility of the evidence, or making any estimate or assessment of its actual probative value, conscious, as I must be sitting as a jury, that the probative value actually assigned to any item of evidence cannot be finally determined until all the evidence to be led at trial is complete.
16The Crown took no issue with the notice requirement in s 97(1)(a).  The Crown objected to the evidence particularised in the notice being led as tendency evidence.  The Crown submitted that the tendency relied upon in the notice is so broadly expressed, and involved incidents of such a minor measure in the context of the child's mother's dealings with her own mother and her child both separately and together over a period of years, that it failed the primary test of relevance under s 55 of the Evidence Act.  
17In so far as the incident involving the child being restrained in the pram, the Crown submitted that, taken at its highest, there was nothing in that incident which suggested that the child's mother was doing anything more than imposing a strict or firm restraint on her child in an attempt to keep the child in the pram.  While he accepted this might indicate a disposition in the child's mother to impose firm or stern discipline, it was not capable of proving a violent tendency or a tendency to violence in the way contended for by the accused.  The Crown submitted that in these circumstances the evidence lacked the capacity to undermine the evidence in the Crown case that served to identify the accused as the person who inflicted the very significant secondary injuries revealed at post-mortem and, in that way, the evidence did not meet the threshold test of relevance under s 55 of the Evidence Act.  The Crown submitted that even if relevant, the evidence lacked the essential and additional degree of significance (or importance or consequence) in establishing or discounting proof of any fact in issue in the trial such as to justify its admission as tendency evidence under s 97(1)(b).  
18I am satisfied that the evidence does meet the threshold test under s 55 of the Evidence Act.  Taking into account the evidence already adduced in the trial, and what I was invited to anticipate would be the evidence to be led, and making a reasoned evaluation of the likely significance or importance the evidence under consideration would be assigned by me in considering when and at whose hand the secondary injuries were, or might have been sustained, I am also satisfied that the evidence particularised in paragraphs 10(b) and 10(c) above is admissible as tendency evidence. I am not satisfied that the evidence at 10(a) qualifies for admission as tendency evidence under s 97 of the Evidence Act.

		01 November 2013",2013-10-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706060,R v Kevin BENNETT [2013] NSWDC 222,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1I am sentencing a young man whose mother reportedly left him in a bin at the age of two. He was found by the local police officer and spent the next five years in foster families with the Department of Family and Community Services. His mother was a heroin addict. His father was a criminal. He was probably exposed to drugs by his mother and crime by his father. The young man's deprived background reduces his culpability and can mitigate a sentence. 

2On the other hand, this young man has a significant criminal record for a 23 year old. He has been in trouble with the law since his early teenage years and has disturbed the peace of the communities in which he has lived by crimes involving damage to property, assaults (including on police), stealing cars, affrays and now armed robberies. He has been given suspended sentences but has breached the bonds and gone into gaol. 

3A judge sentencing an offender often faces this sort of dilemma. Does the judge acknowledge what is obvious - a young man whose life has been skewed in the wrong direction from the start and for whom further gaol time will point him further in that direction - and mitigate the sentence to give him another chance and less gaol? Or does the judge send the man to gaol for an extended period of time so he is kept out of the community which he threatens by his criminal behaviour? There is no one correct answer and each judge must exercise their own judgment about what to do in the particular case. 

4The dilemma is not new. In 1988 the High Court in a case called Veen v The Queen [No 2] [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 ([13]) said this - 

""The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions.""

5Much more recently in Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; (2013) 87 ALJR 1035, a majority of the High Court at [59] referred to its earlier decision in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 and also to Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 and said that ""the sentencer is called on to reach a single sentence which, in the case of an offence like the one now under discussion, balances many different and conflicting features."" 

6I now need to consider the details of this young man's case. His name is Kevin Bennett. I will first say what the crimes are that I am sentencing him for and what happened. Then I will consider his personal circumstances. I will review the arguments for the prosecution and the defence, and then I will sentence Kevin Bennett. 

7Kevin Bennett was arraigned before me and a jury on 20 August 2013 charged with three armed robberies. About a week later on 26 August the jury found him guilty on all three charges. Being armed robberies, the offences are against s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and each of them carries a maximum of 20 years imprisonment. 

8The three armed robberies all occurred on the same day. Two of them occurred at the same place. The day was 8 October 2012. In the morning of that day, Mr Bennett and some accomplices went to a hotel in The Rocks area of Sydney. They could be seen on CCTV walking around the hotel area before the robbery. Two employees of the hotel were in a room together but before 9.00am. Mr Bennett got into the room and produced a knife and what appeared to be a pistol. He robbed one of the employees of a mobile phone and a laptop computer. From the other employee he stole an iPad. Then, still in the company of his accomplices, he went to the Haymarket end of the city and a few hours later bailed up an employee of a foreign exchange service. There were produced to that employee a Taser, a pistol, a knife and scissors. There was stolen from that employee currency, both Australian and international. 

9Needless to say, the three victims of these armed robberies would have been terrified by the experience of being bailed up in the way that they were. I expect that confronted by the kinds of weapons which were produced to them that they would have felt that their lives were in danger. This is one of the reasons that Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the offence of armed robbery.

HIS HONOUR: I am going to suspend my remarks on sentence to ask Ms Hall a question. Ms Hall, that psychological report, do you have instructions for it to be sent to Corrective Services?
HALL: Yes, I do. Sorry, I should have told your Honour last week.
HIS HONOUR: No, it just occurred to me. I've got a note here in front of me, thank you. I direct my associate to this afternoon or tomorrow email or fax to Corrective Services exhibit S1. I now return to the remarks on sentence.

10Kevin Bennett was arrested a couple of days later on 10 October 2012. He went into custody, bail refused, on these charges. He has been in custody ever since. However, for part of the time between then and now he served a period of 6 months, but for other offences which, according to my calculations, leaves a period of almost 6 months which are attributable to these offences alone. 

11I now need to say something about Kevin Bennett himself. He is 23 years of age. As I said, he has a criminal record. He appeared as a teenager regularly in the Children's Court both in Campbelltown and in regional and country courts such as Walgett and Bathurst. He was aged about 12 or 13 when he first appeared. He was given control orders, which are the equivalent of custody for young offenders. He committed offences involving property, affray and assaults against police. 

12Kevin Bennett turned 18 on 25 August 2008. Since then he has committed further crimes involving assaults, property damage and theft of cars. He has been given the benefit of suspended sentences but, as I have said, he breached the bonds attached to those sentences and, at the age of 19, first went into custody. It seems to me that he has never been on adult parole. 

13The only source of information that I have about Kevin Bennett comes from a detailed psychological report prepared by Laura Durkin dated 30 September 2013. It became exhibit S1 in the proceedings. It sets out a good deal of Kevin Bennett's background. With some reservations, I accept the account given by the psychologist from Mr Bennett, partly because it is consistent with his criminal record. The psychologist noted that Mr Bennett had never worked but ""has supported himself through crime"". He apparently acknowledged to Ms Durkin that ""crime is the only work he has ever known."" He found it easier and more profitable than working. The psychologist also noted that Mr Bennett ""has never undergone detoxification, rehabilitation programming or other forms of drug and alcohol treatment."" I make this observation because the history includes an account of Mr Bennett commencing with cannabis at the age of 10 and alcohol at the age of 14. He commenced hard drugs at the age of 17 including amphetamines, cocaine and heroin and crystal methamphetamine, commonly known as ice.

14Ms Durkin said the following at [40] of her report - 

""Mr Bennett's early development was apparently turbulent and he experienced neglect at least. His parents were reportedly dependent on heroin and his father was involved in crime also. When he was two years of age, Mr Bennett's mother abandoned him in a bin in the town and these early life experiences seem to have affected his attachment. He was placed in foster care by FaCS thereafter and apparently achieved a degree of stability. Although he moved families over the course of his five years in care, further compromising his attachment, Mr Bennett advised that the majority of his carers were good people and provided for him well. When he was seven, he was placed in his paternal grandparents' care and again he believes that he was well cared for. He advised that his grandparents provided him love and affection and made some attempt to set boundaries for him but he often defied their rules and engaged in delinquent conduct as a child. Moreover, he sought out his parents who modelled inappropriate conduct and possibly exposed him to risk.""

15The psychologist thought that Mr Bennett's placement in juvenile detention centres reinforced his delinquent attitudes and she observed that he ""appears to have become increasingly embedded in the antisocial subculture."" 

16During his adolescence, Mr Bennett's grandmother died and Mr Bennett told the psychologist that he ""really went down hill"" after she died. That removed a significant support for him and the psychologist observed that ""Mr Bennett has been largely disconnected from the community since, which has further adversely affected his behaviour."" The psychologist thought that Mr Bennett had little desire to extricate himself from his criminal lifestyle. He had an opportunity when he had a partner for a period of time, but the psychologist noted that Mr Bennett ""terminated this relationship rather than change his behaviour and challenge his attitudes."" Significantly, she observed that Mr Bennett ""does not perceive his conduct as wrong; for the community, himself or others. Indeed, his account suggests he is largely operating at the periphery of society, with little responsibility or connection to others and hence little understanding of how his conduct would affect others or the community."" Understandably, that lack of contact and connection to the community ""renders him increasingly vulnerable to ongoing criminal involvement."" 

17His early experiences and social isolation, together with his drug dependence and permissive attitudes ""render him vulnerable to engage in offences such as those currently before the Court"" observed the psychologist. She thought that he will require significant support in the community and that he would benefit from motivational enhancement therapy and should undertake some drug and alcohol courses whilst in custody and be transferred to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre when he has finished his period in custody. 

18Mr Bennett is an indigenous man. The High Court has recently had occasion to consider the principles relating to sentencing indigenous Australians which were the subject of the decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. The High Court considered these principles in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 87 ALJR 1022. The principal judgment was delivered by French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ. At [37] their Honours said that - 

""An Aboriginal offender's deprived background may mitigate the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate for the offence in the same way that the deprived background of a non-Aboriginal offender may mitigate that offender's sentence.""


At [40] their Honours said the following - 

""The circumstance that an offender has been raised in a community surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may mitigate the sentence because his or her moral culpability is likely to be less than the culpability of an offender whose formative years have not been marred in that way.""

19There is no direct evidence in this case of alcohol abuse or violence, but there is evidence of Mr Bennett being raised in his early years in an environment which involved drug addiction and crime. 

20Their Honours pointed out at [41] that in any case where it is sought ""to rely on an offender's background of deprivation in mitigation of sentence, it is necessary to point to material tending to establish that background."" As I have indicated, I am inclined on balance to accept the account given to the psychologist in this case because it is consistent with Mr Bennett's criminal record. 

21At [43] their Honours said the following - 

""The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things, a background of that kind may compromise the person's capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person's make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending.""

I regard those observations as relevant to this case, where the environment was characterised by crime and drug use at an early stage of Mr Bennett's life. 

22At [44] their Honours went on to say that because ""the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to speak of giving 'full weight' to an offender's deprived background in every sentencing decision."" Their Honours added that giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult. Their Honours proceeded to say that an ""offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender."" 

23Once again, I feel that I can adapt those remarks to Mr Bennett's background and circumstances in this case. 

24I now come to consider the arguments put forward on Mr Bennett's behalf by Ms Hall, counsel who appeared for him, and Mr Rowe of counsel who appeared as the Crown Prosecutor. 

25Ms Hall realistically acknowledged that her client must face a full-time custodial sentence. She pointed out that to the psychologist her client had acknowledged his guilt of the offences. She argued that that showed some prospects of rehabilitation. That is in my opinion of very little value. It is a mere acknowledgement of what he had done rather than a real step towards rehabilitation but it is, as Ms Hall said, a start. 

26The two most important factors are probably Mr Bennett's age, which Ms Hall relied upon, and the factors which have been recently re-emphasised by the High Court in Bugmy. Ms Hall acknowledged that her client lives life on the edge of society. But of course that means that other members of the community are paying for his life on the edge as victims of his crimes. I acknowledge that there was some, but limited, planning in the first offence. I also accept Ms Hall's submission, which was also endorsed by the Crown Prosecutor, that Kevin Bennett is at some risk of institutionalisation given his age and the period of time that he has already spent in prison. That factor also amounts to a special circumstance under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which I will eventually take into account in adjusting the relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of the term. 

27Ms Hall realistically acknowledged that there is some risk to the community from her client. Ms Hall reminded me of the guideline judgment relating to armed robberies delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal. That judgment was R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R 149. Their Honours observed that a range would generally be between 4 or 5 years for certain offences, the common elements of which they listed. In this case many of those elements are present, except that Mr Bennett has a significant previous criminal history and did not plead guilty but was found guilty by a jury. 

28The Crown Prosecutor fairly acknowledged that the first two robberies occurred on the same occasion, but I must bear in mind that there were two victims of that robbery. Both involved threats and would have been frightening for all of the victims and I accept that submission. 

29There is little or no evidence of remorse; indeed I do not accept that there is evidence of remorse. 

30The Crown Prosecutor acknowledge Mr Bennett's own personal history. He also indicated, correctly in my opinion, that Mr Bennett's criminal record pointed to escalating criminal behaviour and that I need to bear in mind the protection of the public. He acknowledged that planning was present in the first offence but was limited. He acknowledged the need for some extended period of time on parole referring to Mr Bennett's age, his drug problems and the risk of institutionalisation. Ms Hall added to that the need for individualised treatment when he is in the community - that submission is based upon the psychologist's report. I bear in mind here that Mr Bennett does not appear to have benefited very much from a period of time, if at all, on parole. 

31I come now to consider the appropriate sentences. What I propose to do is to impose one sentence which will be an aggregate sentence under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, but I need to indicate what the sentences would have been for each of the offences. 

32Although the range indicated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment is 4 to 5 years and although in a case like this I would normally regard an appropriate sentence as being towards the top end of that range - or indeed lengthier than that range because of the criminal record and because of the absence of a plea of guilty - nevertheless I regard an appropriate sentence for each case as being one of 4 years imprisonment. The main factors which I have in mind in fixing that are Mr Bennett's age and also his background, upon which I place significant weight. 

33I would have accumulated the 4 year sentences for the first two offences committed at the hotel in The Rocks by a period of some 3 months, although both offences were committed on the same occasion in one episode of criminal behaviour. I regard it as significant that two individuals were put at risk and had their lives threatened so far as they were concerned. I would regard an appropriate sentence for the armed robbery committed in Haymarket as also being one of 4 years imprisonment. But it was quite a separate crime, at a separate location, with a separate victim. On the other hand, it occurred on the same day over one period of criminal behaviour. Nevertheless, I would regard an appropriate accumulation as being 1 year. The overall effect of the three sentences would be a sentence of 5 years and 3 months imprisonment for the three crimes. In due course I will fix that as the head sentence in respect of all of the crimes. 

34The non-parole period envisaged by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a sentence of 5 years and 3 months is nearly 4 years. The ratio mentioned in that Act is 75 per cent so that 75 per cent of the sentence I have suggested or propose to impose is nearly 4 years imprisonment. However, I propose to reduce that ratio from 75 per cent to 60 per cent. I propose to do that because of the factors that I have already referred to which were mentioned both by Ms Hall and by Mr Rowe which amount to special circumstances for adjusting that ratio. Sixty per cent of a sentence of 5 years and 3 months is about 3 years and 2 months, but I would round that off to a non-parole period of 3 years. That sentence should be backdated by 6 months because of the time that Mr Bennett has already spent in custody solely because of these crimes. I bear in mind again the risk of institutionalisation and I am going to adjust that favourably to him to 9 months, so that I propose to backdate the sentence by 9 months to 8 January this year. So that the sentence which I will impose in a moment will be one of 5 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 8 January 2013.

HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you now, Mr Bennett, if you would stand up.

35I set a non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment which commenced on 8 January 2013 and which will expire on 7 January 2016. The balance of the term is 2 years and 3 months commencing 8 January 2016 and it will expire on 7 April 2018. The first date on which it appears to me that you are eligible for release is 7 January 2016. If you would have a seat now, Mr Bennett.

HIS HONOUR: It is over 3 years so I do not direct release on parole. Would you both please check the figures. Five years and 3 months, 3 years non-parole period dated from 8 January 2013 expiring 7 January 2016 for the non-parole. Overall sentence expires 7 April 2018. Just check the figures so we don't have to come back if I'm wrong. No rush, just tell me when you're ready.
HALL: My maths have never been terribly reliable, your Honour, but that looks right to me.
HIS HONOUR: Thank you.
JAMES: Seems to be right.
HIS HONOUR: Good, thank you both. Kevin Bennett, you have got a sentence of 5 years and 3 months. That's one sentence for all three crimes, do you understand? I would have set each one at 4 years but I would have accumulated them and have some of them served at the same time. Overall effect 5 years and 3 months. I've fixed a non-parole period that you have to stay in gaol as 3 years. You've already done 6 months for these crimes, but I'm giving you an extra 3 months in your favour, so your sentence started back on 8 January. Your non-parole period expires 7 January 2016 so you'll be eligible for release on 7 January 2016. It's up to the Parole Authority to decide whether you're released or not. As you've heard me say, I'm going to send that report, which is very comprehensive, to Corrective Services. That will help them in assessing you for your classification. It gives them lots of very important information about your background and things like that. It's going to be very helpful to them. 
What you do now is in your hands. You've heard plenty of judges and magistrates say that to you. You've heard the things that I've said about you. You are a young man and it's entirely up to you now what you do with the rest of your life. You've got to serve your time for what you did to those three people last year, but what you do in custody with the courses that are available to you, and particularly what you do on parole - and I've given you extra time on parole, more than normal, so that you can use that time in the community to try to sort yourself out. Am I right in thinking you haven't spent time on adult parole? No, that's what I thought. So when you're released they'll try to help you change some of this pattern of behaviour. Do you understand all of that? All right, good luck.

		18 November 2013",2013-10-07 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706073,Patterson v Khalsa (No.3) [2013] NSWSC 1331,"Judgment

1In 2009 the plaintiff, Will Patterson, commenced proceedings by his tutor, Jodie Latter, for damages for negligence against the defendant, Akal Khalsa.

2The proceedings concerned the plaintiff's birth at home on 21 October 2006. The defendant, Ms Khalsa, was engaged as an independent midwife to assist, and to be in attendance at the birth. The plaintiff claims that, as a result of Ms Khalsa's negligence, in recommending the home birth in the first place and, subsequently, in the negligent performance of her duties as a midwife, he suffered hypoxia during birth, and was left with cerebral palsy.

3On 22 March 2013, for the reasons which were then published, the Court ordered that there be judgment for the plaintiff, with damages to be assessed: Patterson v Khalsa [2013] NSWSC 336.

4Directions were given with respect to the process to enable damages to be assessed, and a hearing for the assessment of damages took place on 10 May 2013.

5This judgment deals with the assessment of the plaintiff's damages. 

The Birth

6According to the material tendered, the plaintiff's mother went into labour on the morning of 21 October 2006 at about 41 weeks gestation. 

7When Ms Khalsa arrived at about 12 noon, the labour was strong, she detected foetal heart sounds of between 140 and 158 beats per minute. By 2pm, the plaintiff's mother was fully dilated and the plaintiff's head was high.

8Over the next four and a half hours, the birth was protracted and complex. The plaintiff's head descended slowly and, apparently, in a variety of positions. The plaintiff's head was delivered at 6pm, when thick meconium was noted. There was considerable difficulty releasing the plaintiff's shoulders, and eventually the plaintiff was born at 6.50pm. 

9At birth the plaintiff was flat, and oxygen therapy was commenced. He was slow to breathe. An ambulance was called, and the plaintiff and his mother were transported by air ambulance to the Royal Hospital for Women. 

10The plaintiff was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. He was noted to have a right Erb's palsy. He developed encephalopathy within 24 hours of birth, and upon imaging, changes were reported which were consistent with a diffuse hypoxic brain injury. 

The Plaintiff's Development

11On 3 November 2006, Dr Swapnil Shah, the neonatal Fellow at the Newborn Care Centre at Royal Hospital for Women, reported on the plaintiff.

12He said that, upon admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, the plaintiff was in respiratory distress, which was addressed by intubation. He said that the plaintiff was noted to have ""...tonic posturing, which was followed by refractory generalised tonic clonic seizures"". These seizures were treated by a mixture of drugs for the first three days. 

13On the day after his birth, an electroencephalogram showed that the plaintiff was ""... severely encephalopathic with diffuse cerebral inactivity"". On the following day, a repeat EEG showed ""... burst suppression pattern with electrographic seizures consistent with global encephalopathy"". 

14A later MRI of the plaintiff's brain showed a pattern of diffuse hypoxic injury with cortical and sub-cortical signal abnormalities. Upon discharge in late November, a neurological assessment of the plaintiff showed abnormalities including decreased movements of right upper limb and axial hypotonia. 

15The plaintiff was reviewed by Dr Ian Andrews, a paediatric neurologist, when he was three months old. Dr Andrews' impression was recorded in these terms:

""Will had a pretty rocky start, but has made good progress. I suspect he will face neurologic issues relating to the HIE [hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy] but so far he has done extremely well. ...

The right Erb's palsy has made good progress, and I expect it will continue to progress well and does not need any specific treatment.""

16At six months of age, the plaintiff was a reviewed at the Growth & Development Clinic at Royal Hospital for Women by Dr Lee Sutton. Dr Sutton noted this:

""He is still breastfeeding, and has just started solids. He is managing the solids well. He is having speech therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy at the Spastic Centre at Ryde, and they are pleased with his progress. ... Will has had no fits since the neonatal period. Will has a splint for his right hand.""

17He recorded his impression in these terms:

""Will is progressing with his fine and gross motor skills. It was nice to see him so vocal. He is appropriately placed, receiving therapy at the Spastic Centre.""

18When the plaintiff was about 13 months old, he was again seen by Dr Andrews, the paediatric neurologist. Dr Andrews recorded his observations and conclusions in the following way:

""He is now 13 months old. As you know, he experienced hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy and right Erb's palsy in the perinatal period. The sequelae include cerebral palsy, microcephaly, language delay and residual right arm lower motor problems.

There is a marked asymmetry between the right and left arm. He has antigravity movement at his right elbow, but his hand is largely held fisted with the thumb adducted. He picks up objects with his left hand and will bring them to the midline, but does not do this with his right.

...

Impression: 

Will has a static encephalopathy with microcephaly related to his HIE. It is expected that development will slowly progress, however there will be significant issues, both cognitively and motor, which are expected to continue. ...

In addition, Will has reduced function of his right arm. This is like a combination of both lower and upper motor unit function. ...""

19In 2008, at the Oral Health Services Centre at Westmead, it was noted that the plaintiff presented with low facial muscle tone resulting in drooling due to open mouth posture. It was noted that the plaintiff appeared to have delayed development of his feeding skills, and was showing an emerging pattern of solid food management. It was also noted that he presented with clinical signs that might indicate a poor swallow function and possible aspiration. 

20In April 2008, the plaintiff was reviewed by Dr Waugh, a senior staff specialist in paediatric rehabilitation medicine at The Childrens' Hospital at Westmead. Dr Waugh gave this summary of the plaintiff's development:

""Will has general low tone with mild dystonia of his right arm, and adduction of his right thumb. Will has no dynamic catch and normal joint ranges throughout. We explained that in HIE, difficulties with tone and motor movement control may only present at a later age, and Will needs to be monitored for this. ... Will shows some excellent non-verbal communication, but given his motor difficulties, it would be difficult to formally assess him. At around 4 or 5 years of age, when he has more reliable communication, his cognitive ability will be easier to assess. ... Will needs no specific intervention at this current time apart from the therapy he is receiving, but he does need hip surveillance.""

21The plaintiff also came under the care and supervision of Dr Jayne Antony, a paediatric neurologist.

22In a report of 19 January 2009, Dr Antony recorded this:

""Despite the worrisome microcephaly and other adverse factors to suggest hypoxic damage, he was quite alert, aware and very motivated. It was my impression that he probably had some acute upon chronic hypoxic ischemic brain injury, rather than just an acute hypoxic injury towards to the end of the labour. His MRI scan reports also indicated that it was more likely to involve a chronic hypoxic ischemic injury, rather than just an acute hypoxic brain injury.

...

He had an MRI scan of the head on 20.11.08. That showed atrophy and high signal changes in the parasaggital and occipital regions, as well as both motor cortex regions, more marked on the left. There was mild atrophy of the thalami and wedge-shaped atrophy of the left cerebella hemisphere with subtle changes on the right. The left hemisphere was smaller than the right. The angiogram was normal, showing no evidence of abnormal cerebral circulation. The conclusion was that the scan was consistent with hypoxic injury in the newborn period.""

23Dr Antony saw the plaintiff again on 22 June 2009, and reported on the following day that overall he was progressing well, especially with his communication. He was not able to pull himself up to stand, nor to walk. Dr Antony suspected that the plaintiff's head circumference was not increasing, but noted that it was not decreasing. She observed that he was being well cared for, and his management was appropriate.

The Plaintiff at Present 

24In 2012, the plaintiff, who by then was six years old, was referred by his solicitor to Dr Adam Scheinberg, a paediatric rehabilitation specialist. 

25Dr Scheinberg conducted a physical examination of the plaintiff on 14 November 2012, and obtained a comprehensive history from the plaintiff's mother. 

26From his physical examination, Dr Scheinberg expressed this view:

""Will had evidence of quadriplegic cerebral palsy with mixed tone (dystonia affecting right upper limb and low tone affecting other limbs and trunk). He had full passive range of motion in his upper limbs and lower limbs, other than mild contracture in the muscles of his right hand.

...""

27Dr Scheinberg expressed this diagnosis:

""Will has the diagnosis of:

● mixed tone quadriplegic cerebral palsy, low central tone and dystonia affecting right upper limb;

● microcephaly;

● mobility at gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) level IV;

● upper limb function at manual ability classification system (MACS) level II;

● epilepsy not requiring anti-epileptic medication;

● alternating bilateral squint;

● moderate intellectual disability;

● sialorrhoea (drooling); and

● functional independence significantly below able-bodied peers.""

28Dr Scheinberg went on to discuss the plaintiff's prognosis. He concluded that the plaintiff's musculoskeletal deformity associated with his cerebral palsy would be likely to worsen over time with the result that the plaintiff was at risk of developing hip subluxation and scoliosis. 

29He also considered that the plaintiff was unlikely to obtain any independent mobility skills beyond his current level, and that he would be required to use a wheelchair in most settings. He said that the plaintiff would need physical assistance from one or two people to assist in transfers; he said he thought the plaintiff would be physically capable of operating a power wheelchair.

30With respect to his intellectual capacity, Dr Scheinberg expressed this view:

""In my opinion, Will has moderate intellectual disability. He will therefore require support with his learning throughout his childhood as well as physical assistance due to his cerebral palsy. He is likely to remain in a special school during his childhood, and once he reaches adulthood he may seek some daily vocational activity. Due to the combination of his intellectual disability and physical impairment, in my opinion it is highly unlikely that Will would ever be able to obtain paid employment.""

31Dr Scheinberg concluded that the plaintiff had a 90 per cent chance of surviving to 15 years of age, and that if he did so, then his life expectancy would be in the range of 70 to 80 per cent of that of the general male population. 

32Dr Scheinberg also set out in some detail his opinion as to what future treatment and care requirements the plaintiff would need. It is unnecessary to set them all out here. It is sufficient that I say that I accept entirely the future treatment and care requirements prescribed by Dr Scheinberg.

33Of particular importance, is Dr Scheinberg's opinion that the plaintiff will continue to need the full-time support of an attendant carer who does not require to be a registered nurse, but who should be trained in first aid because of an increased risk of the plaintiff having seizures. 

34Finally, Dr Scheinberg concluded that the plaintiff would not be able to live independently as an adult, but would be required either to live in his parents' home, with any assistance being provided by his parents or attendant carers; to live in a group home sharing costs of care with a small number of similarly disabled adults; or else to live in his own home but with all care provided. Dr Scheinberg did not suggest that for medical reasons any one or other of these should be preferred.

35Dr Scheinberg has provided a short updated report dated 16 April 2013. The question posed for Dr Scheinberg's opinion was whether the plaintiff would be able to manage any funds received by him as a consequence of an award of compensation. 

36Dr Scheinberg expressed this opinion:

""Due to Will's significant intellectual disability, in my opinion he will be unable at any age to manage any significant sum of money that might be available as part of a medico-legal settlement. Any such settlement should in my opinion be managed for him by an appropriate financial institution.

Although Will does have some ability to communicate his needs, those abilities will remain at the level of a young child. I suspect that managing even small amounts of money will always be difficult for Will, and he would be at risk of being taken advantage of by others. Therefore, he will require lifelong support in his daily activities, including managing his finances, paying bills or purchasing equipment or services.""

37A report was also prepared by Ms Castle-Burton, a specialist occupational therapist. 

38Ms Castle-Burton, based upon the detailed assessment made by Dr Scheinberg, expressed the opinion that the appropriate level of attendant care to be provided to the plaintiff, would cost $319,374.35 per annum. This is a sum of about $6,140 per week. 

Defendant's Position

39The defendant has elected not to take any further part in the defence of the plaintiff's claim. It was as a consequence of that decision that her defence was struck out on 23 March 2013, and judgment for the plaintiff was entered with damages to be assessed.

40Accordingly, the assessment of damages has proceeded without any challenge to the plaintiff's evidence on damages, either by cross-examination or the tender of contradictory evidence. 

41Whilst it is not an absolute principle of law that a witness' evidence must be taken to be true if it is not the subject of cross-examination, in my view, in this case, in the absence of cross-examination then I ought accept all of the unchallenged evidence: Fabre v Arenales (1992) 27 NSWLR 437 at 451D per Mahoney JA (Priestley and Sheller JJA agreeing); Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital (1989) 17 NSWLR 553 at 587C-588A per Samuels JA (Meagher JA agreeing); Ali v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 183 at [112] per Tobias and McColl JJA 

42There is nothing about the evidence which I have read which on its face is illogical or inherently inconsistent, nor is there any material in the expert opinions which suggests that the history or assumptions upon which those opinions are based, were incorrect or incomplete. I accept all of the evidence which has been tendered by the plaintiff, and I accept the description provided of the plaintiff's development, and his present condition which I have set out above. The assessment of damages will proceed on that basis.

Assessment of Damages

43Any assessment of damages must occur in accordance with the provisions of Part 2 of the Civil Liability Act 2002. 

Non-Economic Loss

44Section 16 of the Civil Liability Act precludes an award for non-economic loss unless the severity of the non-economic loss ""... is at least 15 per cent of a most extreme case"". As well, the provisions of s 16 cap the maximum amount of damages that may be awarded for non-economic loss. Presently, that amount is $535,000. 

45There are a number of features of the phrase ""a most extreme case"" which merit note. The first is that, as Grove J pointed out in Matthews v Dean [1990] Aust Torts Reports 81-037 at 68, 014, the use of the indefinite article ""a"" avoids any requirement to apply the superlative by imagining ""the"" most extreme case. 

46The second is that in Dell v Dalton [1991] NSWCA 76; (1991) 23 NSWLR 528 at 533, Handley JA equated the word ""most"", in the phrase, with the word ""very"". He said that ""most"" did not mean ""... in the greatest quantity, amount, measure, degree or number"".

47The result of this is that there will be a class of cases that may be described as most extreme cases, even if it is possible to imagine another catastrophic injury which is far worse. Speaking generally, a person suffering from quadriplegia has generally been considered as falling into the class of a most extreme case: Southgate v Waterford (1990) 21 NSWLR 427 at 440.

48The plaintiff's injuries and disabilities in this case, all of which are consequential upon the defendant's negligence, include quadriplegia, cerebral palsy, intellectual disability and epilepsy although this does not presently require medication. 

49I am well satisfied that the plaintiff's injuries and disabilities place him in the category of a most extreme case. Accordingly, I assess his non-economic loss as the maximum amount, and I would award $535,000 for this component of damages.

50As the plaintiff is now only six years old, and will suffer the vast majority of his incapacity, injuries and disabilities in the future, it is inappropriate in my view to award any amount of interest on that sum.

Life Expectancy

51It is necessary to assess the plaintiff's life expectancy. This is necessarily an evaluative exercise which is always characterised by some imprecision.

52As earlier noted, Dr Scheinberg expressed the opinion that, due to his cerebral palsy, the plaintiff has a 90 per cent chance of survival to age 15, and thereafter he might expect to have a 70 to 80 per cent of normal life expectancy.

53In estimating the plaintiff's life expectancy, particularly having regard to his young age, it is appropriate to use the prospective Actuarial Life Tables: see Golden Eagle International Trading Pty Ltd v Jian [2007] HCA 15; (2007) 229 CLR 498. I regard it as highly likely that he will survive to the age of 15, and I find that he will do so.

54It is appropriate to take the mid-point of the life expectancy tables, and on that basis, and without applying any reduction for any injury or disability, a person's life expectancy from age six, is an additional 79.20 years of life. 

55After applying the reduction expressed by Dr Scheinberg, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to find that the plaintiff has a further 59.4 years of life. This calculation is based on the life expectancy tables for a six year old. Since his current age is about six and a half years, then it is appropriate to reduce this marginally, and it is appropriate to calculate damages on the basis that the plaintiff has a further 59 years of life.

Economic Loss

56I accept Dr Scheinberg's opinion that the plaintiff's earning capacity has been totally destroyed.

57The plaintiff initially claimed damages with respect to the loss of his future earning capacity on the basis of average weekly earnings from age 18 to 65 plus statutory long service leave and employer paid superannuation entitlements.

58As the plaintiff was born on 21 October 2006, and will reach 18 years of age in 2024, the plaintiff allows for a three year period of tertiary education and claims, appropriately, that he would have been unlikely to exercise his economic capacity until age 21, namely, in October 2027. He would then have a period of full time employment of 44 years.

59Although he would be entitled to claim the entirety of that period, the plaintiff's claim is for a period of employment of 40 years, from 21 to 61 years of age. 

60The plaintiff claims a sum of $826.16 net per week for 40 years, deferred for 15 years until he is 21 years of age. This approach and these parameters are all appropriate.

61Applying the five per cent multipliers to those parameters, a total sum of representing the plaintiff's future lost earning capacity of $364,599 is arrived at. I allow a sum of $365,000 for lost future earning capacity.

62The plaintiff's calculation of the appropriate allowance having regard to this sum, to be made for the loss of the superannuation, which would have been paid for the benefit of the plaintiff, is $40,105. I accept that sum as being entirely reasonable.

Past and Future Out of Pocket Expenses

63It is clear that the plaintiff's parents have incurred significant expenses on his behalf to date, and will continue to incur significant expenses on his behalf in the future.

64The plaintiff submits that, as the plaintiff's parents propose to meet such expenses, and will not require any repayment from him for such expenses, then he does not wish to press a claim for these expenses. In so doing, the plaintiff notes that the defendant is uninsured. 

65In light of the fact that the plaintiff does not press a claim for these amounts, it would be inappropriate for the Court to make an award of those amounts. 

66However, it is appropriate to note that the plaintiff is entitled to all reasonable past out-of-pocket expenses and a sum to represent his expenditure on future out-of-pocket expenses. With a person suffering from injuries and disabilities of the kind from which the plaintiff suffers, these out-of-pocket expenses can often be significant. 

67Had the plaintiff pressed his claim for these amounts, I would have been prepared to have allowed them in full insofar as they were reasonable, and they were incurred, or else would be incurred, as a consequence of the injuries and disabilities from which the plaintiff suffers. 

Domestic and Attendant Care

68It is clear beyond argument, that the plaintiff requires a full-time attendant carer. 

69To date, that full-time attendant care has been provided by his parents. In accordance with the principles in Griffith v Kerkemeyer [1977] HCA 44, (1997) 139 CLR 161, the plaintiff is entitled to a sum which would reflect the value of the gratuitously provided attendant care services.

70I would have been prepared, had the plaintiff pressed his claim for this, to have awarded an appropriate sum for such services. However, the plaintiff does not press such a claim, in light of the uninsured status of the defendant.

71In dealing with the future costs of domestic and attendant care, the plaintiff claims for the next six years to age twelve, an amount of six hours per day of additional care over and above what would reasonably be required for a child of that age. From age 13 years to 18 years, the plaintiff claims 12 hours per day of care over and above the amount of care that would ordinarily be required of a child of that age. For the balance of his life, that is to say from age 18 until age 61, the plaintiff claims 24 hours per day of care. 

72I regard all of these claims as being entirely reasonable, and I would award the plaintiff the sum for damages which takes account of this entire claim at the rates described by Ms Castle-Burton.

73That sum is $4,247,311.00. I allow it as being a reasonable sum for this aspect of the plaintiff's future needs

Funds Management

74The plaintiff claims the cost of future funds management. Having regard to his injuries and disabilities and, in particular, his moderate intellectual disability, and the opinion of Dr Scheinberg, which I accept, that the plaintiff would be unable to manage large sums of money, I am satisfied that the plaintiff is entitled, in accordance with the principles in the Nominal Defendant v Gardikiotis [1996] HCA 53; (1996) 186 CLR 49, to an appropriate sum for claims management.

75According to the report of Jane Campbell, a fund manager, a fair and reasonable amount to allow for the management of an invested fund of $5M for a period of fifty-five years is $1,419,177. I regard this as an appropriate sum to allow for this head of damage and I allow it in full.

Total Assessed Damages

76I assess a reasonable award for the plaintiff's damages in the following way:





Non-Economic Loss

$535,000.00


Future Economic Loss

$365,000.00


Future Superannuation Entitlement

$40,105.00


Future Domestic and attendant care

$4,247,311.00


Total

$5,187,406.00





Funds Management Cost

$1,419,177.00


Total:

$6,606,583.00

Orders

77I make the following orders:

(1)Judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $6,606,583.00

(2)Defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs.

2706074,Richardson v R [2013] NSWCCA 218,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
Offence and sentence
On 1 November 2011 the appellant was arraigned before McCallum J in the Supreme Court on a charge that between 17 April and 25 April 2010 at a place unknown in the State of NSW, he did murder Kirrilee Nicole Grant (the deceased) contrary to s18(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900.

2The appellant pleaded not guilty and the trial proceeded before her Honour and a jury of twelve. Both manslaughter and murder were left to the jury. On 21 November 2011, the jury retired to consider its verdict. On 23 November 2011 the jury returned a verdict of guilty to the offence of murder.

3On 18 May 2012 the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 21 years, commencing 4 May 2010 and concluding 3 May 2031, with a balance of term of 7 years concluding 3 May 2038.

4The appellant has appealed against his conviction and has sought leave to appeal against his sentence.

5In relation to his conviction, the appellant relies upon a single ground of appeal.

Ground 1: The use of tendency evidence for the non-propensity purpose to establish a motive to kill has resulted in a substantial miscarriage of justice.

6The appellant and the deceased had been in a relationship from time to time since 1997. They had both suffered from depression and had been addicted at times to heroin.

7Between 2007 and 2009 they were living together. In 2009 the deceased lost her job and the relationship between the appellant and the deceased broke down. 

8On 23 October 2009 the deceased attended Maroubra Police Station and complained that the appellant had bound and gagged her, jumped on her and taken her wallet the night before. The appellant was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and Local Court proceedings began. 

9The deceased lived with Mr Phillips, a close friend and ex-partner, for about two months before returning to live at the appellant's Malabar flat in mid April 2010. She was due to give evidence against the appellant in the assault case, which was listed for hearing on 19 April 2010.

10On 12 April 2010 the deceased's car was transferred into the appellant's name. On 16 April 2010 the deceased was locked out of the appellant's unit. She called the police and said that she had been assaulted by the appellant. At the time she was observed to be significantly affected by alcohol and drugs and was so incoherent that when police attended, they took her to hospital. The following day she returned to the appellant's unit.

11On the night of 17 April 2010, the deceased borrowed a mobile phone from a neighbour. When the neighbour came to the door to retrieve the mobile phone, she observed the deceased with a tissue over her mouth and the neighbour said that the deceased told her that the appellant was trying to kill her. In the early hours of 18 April the deceased and the appellant made several telephone calls to the NAB. Those calls were recorded. The purpose of the calls was to order a new credit card for the deceased. At times during the calls, the deceased could be heard crying. During the calls she said that she and her boyfriend were going away on holidays. 

12At approximately 11pm on 18 April, a neighbour heard noises coming from the appellant's unit which sounded like something being moved or packed. She next heard the sound of something heavy being moved down the stairwell. A few minutes later, she observed from her balcony the appellant standing next to a white vehicle holding a trolley. The rear driver's side door was open.

13On Monday, 19 April the deceased failed to appear at Waverley Local Court. Telephone calls on 18 and 19 April by a police officer to the deceased's mobile phone were not answered. On 19 April Mr Phillips reported to the police that the deceased was missing. He had attended the appellant's unit to ask where the deceased was, had observed some of her property there and did not accept the appellant's account that she had left.

14The police attended the appellant's unit a number of times to speak to him about the deceased. The unit was searched on 24 and 25 April 2010. The appellant's car was taken by police on 25 April 2010. 

15On 30 September 2010 the deceased's dismembered body was found by a property owner in Gerringong, on the side of the road under a bush. It was in a number of plastic bags. The body was significantly decomposed.

16A forensic pathologist identified those injuries that could be observed from the remains. These were consistent with having occurred while the deceased was still alive. Due to the degree of decomposition, the dismemberment of the body and because parts of the body were missing, a cause of death could not be determined. The decomposition of the body caused the pathologist more problems in reaching conclusions than the dismemberment. 

17An examination of the appellant's motor vehicle revealed blood in a number of areas including:

(a) On the steering wheel.

(b) On the driver's door armrest.

(c) On the inside boot lining.

(d) On the rear car seat cover.

(e) On the top of the base plate of a removalist's trolley located on the backseat of the vehicle.

(f) On the handle of the shovel found in the boot of the car.

DNA, extracted from swabs taken from the above yielded a profile consistent with that of the deceased. During a search by police of the appellant's premises on 27 April 2010, a Bunnings receipt for the purchase of a shovel and a Coles receipt for Multix Garden Bags were found.

18It was the Crown case that the appellant had used a circular saw and other items found with the body to dismember the body in his apartment, to make it easier to remove without arousing suspicion.

Defence case

19The appellant gave evidence at trial. The effect of his evidence was as follows. He had met the deceased in 1997 and they had commenced a relationship. He became aware that the deceased worked as a prostitute and that she was a user of heroin, cocaine, alcohol and prescription drugs. After some time, the relationship broke up. In 2002 he overcame his heroin addiction. In 2003 he began receiving a disability pension and in 2005 he moved into a Housing Commission unit in Wyee Place, Malabar.

20In 2004 he had a chance meeting with the deceased and in 2007 they resumed their relationship. The deceased moved into his unit. The appellant said that at this time, the deceased had completed a methadone program and was no longer working at Kings Cross. He said that he was working as a labourer and through his contacts, obtained a job for the deceased, working as a strapper with a racehorse trainer in Randwick.

21In early 2009 the deceased lost her job after she was injured. This led to her drinking more and she started using drugs again. The appellant said that he was the holder of the deceased's keycard for the majority of the time because she frequently lost her wallet and because she could never remember her PIN. 

22The appellant gave evidence concerning the assault charges brought against him in relation to the deceased as follows. The deceased had a twin sister who had been murdered. On 22 October 2009 the deceased drank a bottle of Bourbon and took some Zanax tablets. An argument occurred when the appellant refused to take the deceased to Kings Cross to continue drinking. The appellant said that the deceased wanted to end her life and be with her sister. She went to the toolbox in the kitchen, collected some cable ties, a pair of scissors, some tape and a sock. She wanted him to kill her in a way similar to how her sister had been killed.

23The appellant said that he was concerned for the neighbours because the deceased was getting louder and louder, so he put the cable ties on her ankles and wrists and it seemed to calm her down. After about 20 or 30 minutes, he unclipped the ties with scissors and gave her four or five Valium tablets. He took some of the tablets himself and went to sleep. Earlier in the night, he had taken the deceased's wallet to prevent her going to Kings Cross and causing trouble for herself. When she asked for the wallet he refused to give it back because he was fearful of her running off to the Cross and getting into trouble.

24The appellant denied grabbing the deceased by the neck and hauling her to the floor. He admitted that he did take the deceased's wallet and say to her ""you're not getting it back"". He admitted that he also said ""you're not leaving the flat, you're not calling the police. I'm going to teach you something tonight"". He agreed that he probably also said ""I've had enough of you. I've put twelve years into you and you don't respect me. I'm going to teach you a lesson.""

25The appellant denied saying to the deceased that both she and her sister deserved to die. He denied putting a sock in her mouth. He denied striking the deceased that night, or at any time in their relationship. He denied using gaffer tape on her that night. 

26The appellant said that when he woke up, the deceased was gone and he assumed that she had taken off to the Cross. Later he was spoken to by police and charged. He was refused bail and remained in custody for five weeks. When he was released from custody, he returned to the unit and discovered that a lot of his valuables had been stolen or were missing. He went to the police but they told him to deal with it in the Family Court.

27The appellant said that his relationship with the deceased continued to deteriorate because of the deceased's intake of alcohol and tablets. There was a period of time when the deceased was living at two places - his place and that of Mr Phillips. This went on for about two or three weeks. The appellant said that as the hearing date for the assault charges of 19 April came closer, he and the deceased talked about how she had intentionally missed the previous court dates and how she was never going to attend the upcoming one. He said that it was the deceased's belief that because she was never going to attend court, the charges would be dismissed.

28The appellant said that he was aware that the deceased was complaining that she was in a violent relationship with him in the lead up to 19 April. He said that she was trying to make him look bad as a person because for the first time in their relationship, he was putting his foot down and saying no to a lot of her requests and demands in relation to alcohol and prescription drugs. He denied assaulting the deceased on 16 April.

29The appellant said that on 17 April the deceased went to the Cross. When she got home, she took tablets and drank a bottle of alcohol. She rang the NAB to cancel her keycard because she believed that Mr Phillips had the card and was going to withdraw money. The appellant said that the deceased was extremely intoxicated and that her words were slurred. At one stage, the operator could not get much out of the deceased and it was necessary for the appellant to speak on the phone himself.

30The appellant said that after the borrowed mobile phone was returned to the neighbour, the argument between him and the deceased continued. The deceased wanted to go back to the Cross. She was determined to get out of the house and he did not want her to go. She started slapping and hitting him to get past him to the front door. He pushed her hands away to stop her hitting him. He pushed her and they both fell over and the deceased smashed her head on the coffee table in the lounge room. She remained on the floor and did not move. He checked her breathing and touched her on the lips and on the shoulder. He checked her neck for a pulse and that was when he panicked. Her lips had turned a bluey-purple colour and her skin was turning a similar colour, but in blotches.

31The appellant said that he sat on a lounge chair and had two or three cigarettes in a row. He was panicking, thinking that the police were going to think that he had killed her. The appellant said that he thought that because of the recent attention he had been receiving from the police, the allegations that had previously been made against him and the fact that the court case was on the next day. He took the deceased into the bathroom and then came back to the lounge room. He had some marijuana and some more cigarettes and tried to think of what to do.

32He went to the laundry, got a power saw and dismembered the deceased's body. Initially he was going to just dispose of the body but he was fearful of being seen taking the body out of the unit. He put the deceased's body in black garbage bags. The bags were too weak and later that day he bought stronger bags and a shovel. 

33The appellant said that he intended to bury the deceased in bushland. He left at about midnight on Sunday and went to the South Coast. He used the trolley from the storeroom in the unit block. He found a dirt road that he thought might lead to somewhere obscure. He attempted to dig a hole but the ground was rock hard and it was not possible to use the shovel. He wanted to get it over and done with as quickly as possible, so he placed the bags in a lantana bush.

34The appellant said that the next day he went to court. He said that he did not kill the deceased to stop her from going to court. He said that she never had any intention of going to court. He did not mean to kill the deceased, or hurt her. The appellant said that he did not tell the truth about the deceased to Mr Phillips when he saw him a few days later. He did not tell the police the truth about the deceased because he was fearful of being accused of killing her. He did not tell the truth to anybody when they asked about the deceased.

35Under cross-examination the appellant agreed that when police spoke to him on 23 October 2009 he told them that there had been no cable ties tied around any part of the deceased's body. He agreed that he had lied to police when he was spoken to in 2009. He said that what he did in the interview was to try to make himself look better than the deceased. He agreed that he had lied to protect himself.

36The appellant agreed that in October 2009 the motor vehicle was the deceased's and that it was her pride and joy. He said that he was not angry with the deceased because he had been bail refused after she made her complaint against him on 23 October 2009. He was more disappointed than angry. The appellant denied telling a mutual friend that when the court case was finished he was going to ""piss Ms Grant off"". He said that what he in fact told the friend was that they ""were in the process of possibly breaking up"".

37The appellant said that he never once thought that he was going to go back to gaol on 19 April and that he had no fear about that court date. He agreed that he did not want to go back to gaol on that date. He agreed that he was angry when the deceased made a complaint against him and police came to his unit on 16 April 2010.

Conduct of trial

38Before the trial commenced, a number of pre-trial issues were raised with the trial judge. On 24 October 2011 the Crown informed her Honour that although notice had been given pursuant to s97(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act), the Crown did not propose to rely on any aspect of the deceased's prior relationship with the appellant as tendency evidence.

39On 28 October 2011 there was further discussion about the tender of the deceased's statement to police on 23 October 2009 (the statement). Senior counsel for the appellant was asked whether he objected to the admission of the statement. He informed the trial judge that the appellant did not dispute everything that occurred on 23 October and that ""aspects of the complaint made by the deceased as to the accused's conduct on 23 October will not be in contest"" (T.28 October 2011, p32.8). He said that ""the extent to which there may be exaggerations these may be capable of being addressed in evidence"" (T.28.10.2011, p33.23).

40Senior counsel for the appellant's ultimate submission was ""I have to concede that there were relevant aspects of what she says which would animate the non-tendency headings which would make it relevant"" (T.28.10.2011, p32.45). He subsequently added ""I am content on the motive aspect"" (T.28.10.2011, p33.5):

""HER HONOUR: There must be a compelling argument for the Crown to get it in as motive.

TURNBULL: I have never for a moment thought otherwise."" (T.28.10.2011, p33.10)

41Later senior counsel for the appellant said:

""I have to say frankly that I will expect there will be certain matters which ought to come forward, but those could come forward through the police officer who took the statement without going into a statement from her and I would certainly be very much opposed to the statement itself going in in any documentary form. So it is a matter where one has to be careful, but I accept there is relevance for motive."" (T.28.10.2011, p33.23)

42What is apparent from those exchanges is that as at 28 October 2011 (before the trial had commenced) senior counsel for the appellant had conceded that the contents of the statement were relevant as evidence of motive, but was still considering his position as to the best way in which that evidence should be adduced.

43The trial commenced on 1 November 2011. On 2 November 2011 Constable Morgan gave evidence of taking part in a search of the appellant's premises under a search warrant on 27 April 2010 and locating a number of items including the statement. The statement was marked ""MFI 4"" at that time.

44On 3 November 2011 Senior Constable O'Connor gave evidence that she had been working at Maroubra Police Station on Friday, 23 October 2009 when the deceased attended to report the assault. She observed that the deceased had been treated by ambulance officers and had red marks around her wrists and ankles. The deceased told her that the injuries were the result of the appellant tying her up with cable ties. She complained of chest pains, stating that the appellant had jumped on her chest. She provided the police with a bag which had four black cable ties in it, which appeared to have been cut. Senior Constable O'Connor subsequently took the statement from the deceased in the emergency room of the Prince of Wales Hospital. This was the statement MFI 4.

45The Crown sought to tender MFI 4 during the evidence of Senior Constable O'Connor as being relevant to motive. Her Honour then asked Senior counsel for the appellant ""Is it appropriate to admit it for the purpose you understand it was being tendered for?"" and this exchange ensued:

""TURNBULL: No, not if there is an additional matter and can I just say and I think your Honour may be thinking this, it may be that your Honour will need to assist the jury with a compendious direction at the appropriate time. 

HER HONOUR: That was exactly what was going through my mind. Could we defer it because when it is tendered, I need to know precisely the purpose for which it is going in, so that I can explain that to the jury."" (T.3.11.2011, p203.11)

46Senior Constable O'Connor was then cross-examined by senior counsel for the appellant who adduced evidence from her in relation to what happened after the deceased made the statement. Senior Constable O'Connor agreed that the appellant had been charged and refused bail in relation to the deceased's allegation and that police were unable to locate the deceased to give evidence against him on 30 November 2009 which was the first date fixed for the hearing of the assault charge. Senior counsel for the appellant also elicited that the punishment which the appellant faced would have been ""meted out"" in the Local Court. The matter was adjourned to enable the police to locate the deceased and another hearing date of 19 April 2010 was fixed. 

47At the conclusion of the cross-examination of Senior Constable O'Connor, the Crown prosecutor pressed for the tender of the statement. In response senior counsel for the appellant said:

""I cannot resist my learned friend's proposition that the allegation itself and some of the detail of that allegation being serious as it is, is relevant to the question of motive as she seeks to develop it. I cannot resist the suggestion that in relation to the injuries, there may be a motive because of the likelihood of fulltime custody, it being suggested that they are serious and the conduct is serious enough to warrant that."" (T.3.11.2011, 220.7)

48The morning after that evidence was given, her Honour gave the jury the following direction:

""Before we get underway today with any further evidence, I want to explain something to you about some of the evidence you have heard yesterday. 

You heard evidence from a number of witnesses about two separate occasions before April 2010 when Kirralee Grant made allegations that the accused had assaulted her.

The first in time were the allegations she made on 23 October 2009 and you heard from Senior Constable Brooke O'Connor about that. She was the blond Constable from Sawtell, with the kind of suntan you might have if you work in Sawtell. And she had taken a statement from Kirrilee Grant and in due course the accused was charged in October 2009 with the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the strength of what Kirrilee Grant told Constable Brooke O'Connor. 

The second in time was the evidence you heard about the events of the night of 16 and 17 April 2010. And to put that time frame in context, the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm from the October allegations was due to be heard in court on 19 April 2010. ... 

So, there doesn't appear to be any issue about the fact that Kirrilee Grant died and that the accused dealt with her body.

There is, however, very clearly a critical issue about the events before that. So, the evidence of the earlier allegations made by Kirrilee Grant against the accused has been admitted to enable you to assess the events of the weekend in their context. 

The Crown relies upon the evidence because it says that the fact that the accused was due to face that charge in court on the Monday, 19 April 2010, gave him a motive to be rid of Kirrilee Grant. That's the Crown case. 

Importantly, the accused also relies on that very circumstance. His case, as I apprehend it, will be that, of course it would be perceived that he had a motive to be rid of Kirrilee Grant and that is precisely why he took the steps he did in dealing with her body, but that he is not guilty of her murder. That's the accused's case.

Obviously, you are going to hear a great deal more about the way in which the Crown puts her case and, from Mr Turnbull, about the way the accused puts his case. You will be addressed by them in some detail. I'm not purporting to summarise their whole cases at the moment. I am just leading up to the important point I wanted to make to you this morning. 

Particularly important in that context of the accused's case, as I apprehend it will be, is the evidence of 16 and 17 April, that's the Friday night, three days before the accused is due to appear in court, he finds himself facing a further allegation by Kirrilee Grant, with seven police attending his unit. And after they are called no statement is taken from her and no injuries are found, but plainly he would have been acutely aware of those events over the weekend.

Most important is this: The evidence is not relied upon to prove that the accused had a tendency to act in any particular way or to have a particular state of mind. 

You must not use the evidence of the prior assaults to reason that because it is alleged by Kirrilee Grant that he was aggressive towards her on an earlier occasion that therefore he must have been aggressive towards her in events relating to the charge you are to determine of murder. It would be wrong of you to reason in that way. 

That's because the Crown doesn't rely on the evidence for that purpose. The Crown doesn't rely on the evidence to establish that the accused had a tendency to use violence against Kirrilee Grant or to be aggressive towards her and he was the kind of person that acted in that way and, therefore, it is likely he is guilty of murder. It is not put in that way and it would be quite wrong of you to reason in that way.

The evidence has been put before you, as I said has been relied upon, both by the Crown and by the accused, on this question of what would have been in the mind of the accused over the weekend and the events leading up to the relevant circumstances."" (T.4.11.2011 - p229.6)

49MFI 4 was subsequently tendered on 10 November 2011 through the officer-in-charge, Detective Sergeant Stephen Giles, who was the last witness in the Crown case. Consistent with the earlier indication of senior counsel on 4 November 2011 as to his position, there was no objection to its tender and it was marked Exhibit S (T.10.11.2011, p620.58). Senior counsel for the appellant asked that the statement, Exhibit S, be read to the jury.

50Exhibit S is the statement by the deceased to the police, dated 23 October 2009. Relevantly it contained the following:

""4 During our three year relationship, Neal assaulted me on one occasion approximately four months ago where he punched me in the left eye. I never reported this incident to police. We have had several verbal arguments but no other assaults.

5 About 4pm on Thursday, 22nd October 2009 Neal and I went to the Pagewood Hotel for approximately 45 minutes. During this time we had consumed two schooners each of full strength beer. After the pub we went to Coles Supermarket ... where I bought some ingredients to cook dinner that evening. Neal bought a bottle of bourbon as well.

6 Between 6.30pm and 6.45pm we arrived home and I made dinner for us both. After cooking dinner I placed it on the table for Neal, however he didn't eat it. Neal was sitting in the lounge room watching TV. He became very snappy towards me and began arguing with me saying ""You're going to spend all the money on drugs tonight at Kings Cross tonight"". I replied ""No, I'm not. It's for the car. I'm staying home tonight. The next thing I knew, Neal grabbed my wallet which was attached to a chain hooked onto my belt. The chain broke off my belt and Neal took my wallet. I said ""Give me back my wallet"". He said ""You're not getting it back. You're not leaving the flat, you're not calling the police. I'm going to teach you something tonight. I've had enough of you. I've put twelve years into you. You don't respect me. I'm going to teach you a lesson. That's why your sister died 'cause you're both cunts and you both deserve to die. No man could put up with you"".

7 The argument continued in the hallway of the unit when Neal grabbed me around the neck with a tartan tie that I was wearing around my neck. As Neal has pulled the tie I have fallen to the floor on my left side. He has then pushed me on my chest where my back hit the ground. I had difficulty breathing and was in fear of my safety.

8 Neal began to drag me by my leg into the bedroom. I can't remember if it was both legs or just one. I saw Neal grab black cable ties from the floor next to his side of bed. I have never seen these cable ties before. He then tied my hands behind me and then my feet together. The cable ties had sharp edges which were cutting into my skin. While lying on the floor I began crying in fear of my safety. I also noticed a pair of scissors with a red handle lying on the bedroom floor. 

He said: ""Shutup, shutup. Stop your whimpering. I don't want to hear you cry. This will stop you crying.""

I saw Neal grab a black sock and then he took out the dentures from my mouth before pushing the sock down my throat. This restricted my breathing and I began to panic. I saw him pick up black masking tape from the ground, ripping two pieces off placing one over my mouth. I don't know what he did with the other piece.

9 Neal lent over towards me pushing his knees twice into the left side of my chest and stomach area with force. This restricted my breathing and I felt immediate pain to my chest area. As I was trying to catch my breath, Neal removed the masking tape from my face. Whilst ripping it off quickly, I felt a burning sensation to my mouth area. He removed the sock that was in my mouth which helped me breathe again.

10 Neal walked out of the room for a short time before returning to the bedroom where he fell asleep on the bed. This incident went for several hours and I think it was about 4.45am when he eventually went to sleep.

11 I lied on the ground for a while to make sure he was asleep and I could hear him snoring. I got the scissors and tried to cut the cable ties from my hands, however, this didn't seem to work so I grabbed a lighter from the bedroom floor and began to burn the cable ties. I stopped using the lighter as I was burning my wrists. As I still couldn't break the cable ties, I again used the scissors and eventually cut the tie. Once I released my hands, I then cut the cable ties from my legs.

12 I grabbed my two bags from the bedroom and walked out quietly to the lounge room where I picked up my cigarettes before leaving the unit. ...

13 About 8.50am on Friday, 23 October 2009 I attended Maroubra Police Station and spoke to a police officer where I told them what happened. As a result of the pain I am experiencing to my chest area, police contacted ambulance officers who arrived shortly after and treated me.

14 I then attended the Emergency Department of the Prince of Wales Hospital Randwick where I was treated for my injuries. Senior Constable O'Connor and Detective Smith attended the hospital where I made this statement. I gave Senior Constable O'Connor the cable ties and the tartan tie. I gave Detective Smith my house keys and signed a consent form for police to enter my premises. ...""

51When MFI 4 was tendered and became Exhibit S on 10 November 2011, no request for any additional direction was made. No complaint was made by senior counsel for the appellant concerning the adequacy of the direction given by her Honour on 4 November 2011.

52Her Honour's summing up concerning Exhibit S was in the following terms:

""104 The next specific direction that I want to give you relates to the evidence of the incident on 23 October, which is a prior allegation of assault by Kirrilee Grant. In that context I simply want to remind you of the direction I gave you at the time that evidence was led. 

105 The evidence of the events of 23 October 2009 is not relied upon by the Crown to prove that the accused had a tendency to reason in any particular way, or to have a particular state of mind. You mustn't use that evidence to reason that because it is alleged by Kirrilee Grant that she had previously been assaulted by the accused, that he was aggressive towards her in a particular way, that therefore he must have been aggressive towards her on the evening of 17-18 April in relation to the events of the primary charge of murder. It would be wrong for you to reason in that way, and that's because the Crown hasn't relied on that evidence in that way. The Crown is not putting to you that the events of 23 October demonstrate that the accused had a tendency to be an aggressive or violent person. It is put in a very different way and relied upon by both Crown and the accused.

106 The Crown relies on those events as providing a motive for the accused to want to be rid of Kirrilee Grant because he was due to face the assault charge the day after she died. The accused relies on those events as explaining his conduct in disposing of the body. But neither party invites you to pay any attention to that in reasoning whether the accused was a person given to behaving aggressively towards Kirrilee Grant.

...""

53Later in the summing up, her Honour revisited that issue in the following terms:

""111 Looming large in the Crown's circumstantial case is the fact that the death of Kirrilee Grant occurred the day before the accused was due to face court for the hearing of a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, allegedly committed against her. Both the Crown and the accused rely on that circumstance in support of their cases. There is no contest in the evidence that the accused was in fact due in court on the 19 April 2010. The Crown says, when you look at the evidence concerning that offence, you would conclude that the accused had a motive to be rid of Kirrilee Grant. And the accused says, well of course that's the way it would look, and that explains why he took the steps he took in relation to disposing of the body when faced with, on his account, her accidental death in his apartment on the evening of 17-18 April. 

112 So although you must not be distracted from your primary task, which relates to the events of 18 April, the events of 23 October 2009 play an important role in both cases, both the case for the Crown and the case for the accused. Both counsel have invited you in that context to pay close attention to assessing the reliability of what Kirrilee Grant says about that night.""

54In the summing up, her Honour (S/U 51-60, [113] - [155]) set out in detail the evidence on this issue and how both parties relied on it as motive. Her Honour also set out the relevant evidence as to whether the appellant believed that the deceased was actually going to attend court on 19 April and the basis for his belief that she would not attend, which was said to undermine the strength of the Crown's case as to motive (S/U 60-68, [156] - [178]).

The appeal

55The appellant accepted that the evidence was tendered for a non-propensity purpose. He submitted that despite this, the form of the evidence and the details of it were so prejudicially demonstrative of a tendency to be violent that none of the directions or warnings given would have prevented the use of the evidence as showing a tendency. This submission was maintained despite the fact that at trial senior counsel for the appellant made a considered decision not only not to object to the evidence but to rely upon it in the appellant's case as to his motive.

56The submission is misconceived and should be rejected. The Crown did not rely upon the statement, Exhibit S, for tendency purposes but as providing evidence of the appellant's motive for killing the deceased. It was not disputed that Exhibit S was relevant for that purpose. Moreover, no objection was taken by senior counsel for the appellant to its tender. On the contrary senior counsel for the appellant also relied upon Exhibit S as providing an explanation for why the appellant had dismembered the deceased's body.

57It was not submitted by the appellant that senior counsel who conducted the trial was incompetent. Such a submission was expressly eschewed in the appeal. That approach was entirely proper in that the decision not to object to the tender of Exhibit S and to rely upon it in the appellant's case was a careful and considered one made by experienced senior counsel. The reasons for doing so are self-evident when one takes into account the need for the appellant to provide an explanation for the dismemberment of the deceased's body which was consistent with him not being guilty of the offence of murder.

58For the submission to be successful, this Court would have to find that the admission of Exhibit S had brought about a miscarriage of justice so that a new trial was warranted. It is not open to this Court to make such a finding, given the lack of objection on behalf of the appellant at trial and the strong and clear directions against tendency reasoning given on two occasions by the trial judge.

59The appellant submitted that a significant amount of the Crown evidence related to the alleged assault in October 2009 so that it became a central issue in the trial, rather than the murder itself. The appellant submitted that in those circumstances, the alleged assault on the deceased in October 2009 needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt before it could form part of the Crown case. The appellant relied upon ES v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 197 to support the submission.

60ES was a child sexual assault case in which the complainant's sister, K, gave evidence that she had observed the offender engaging in inappropriate sexual contact with the complainant in a bedroom. The Court held that this evidence on its face was tendency evidence and that when objection was taken on behalf of the offender to the evidence, the trial judge made no reference to either s97 or s101 of the Act. The Court rejected the evidence because of the Crown's failure to comply with s97. As such its admission constituted a miscarriage of justice.

61As can be seen, ES does not provide authority for the proposition put by the appellant.

62To the extent that there is authority on this issue, it can be found in KJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 132. The offence in that case was murder. The issue at trial was provocation. There was no issue that the offender killed his wife in their bedroom with a plumber's tool. Some time before the killing, the offender's eldest daughter had left home and accused him of sexually assaulting her over a period of five years. The offender denied the claims and his wife, the deceased, believed him and supported him. 

63It was the offender's case that on the morning of the killing, he and the deceased started arguing during the course of which the deceased said that she had supported him in preference to their daughter. The offender took this to mean that the deceased no longer believed him in relation to the daughter's allegations and that in effect she was accusing him of being a paedophile.

64One of the matters raised on appeal in that matter was whether the Crown needed to establish the fact of the offender having sexually assaulted his daughter beyond reasonable doubt as part of its case. I rejected that proposition (Latham J and Barr AJ agreeing) on the basis that it was never part of the Crown case, either expressly or implicitly, that the sexual assaults had taken place. It was sufficient for the Crown case that the accusation had been made. 

65That is the situation which existed in this case. It was not part of the Crown case that the deceased had in fact been assaulted in October 2009. All that the Crown needed to prove was that the deceased had made the accusation and that the matter was to be dealt with by the courts and that if the deceased gave evidence in accordance with her complaint, there was a strong likelihood of the appellant receiving a substantial gaol sentence.

66This submission by the appellant should be rejected.

67The appellant submitted that a miscarriage of justice occurred because Exhibit S contained information which went beyond that necessary to establish motive in the Crown case. In that regard, the appellant relied on the specific details of the alleged assault on 23 October 2009 and on the reference to an earlier incident in which the deceased alleged that the appellant had punched her in the eye. The appellant submitted that the specific details of the alleged assault, i.e. that the deceased was bound, gagged, tied up, threatened with death and was confronted with disturbing and abusive references to her sister's death, together with an actual assault went beyond what was necessary to establish motive and would inevitably have given rise to tendency reasoning on the part of the jury, regardless of any directions made by the trial judge.

68This submission should not be accepted. The details of the alleged assault on 23 October were relevant to motive. This was because the Crown needed to establish that if the deceased was believed in the Local Court proceedings, there was a strong likelihood that the appellant would receive a substantial gaol sentence. Accordingly, the details of the alleged assault needed to be placed before the jury for that purpose.

69The earlier incident in which the deceased alleged that she was punched in the eye by the appellant, played no part in the trial. Apart from being mentioned in the statement, nothing was said about the incident by either side in the trial. In that regard, it is trite to observe that the effect of this relatively minor incident on the jury would have been swamped by the powerful effect of the dismembering of the deceased's body and the other circumstances relating directly to her death. In any event, this incident was covered by the trial judge's direction to the jury not to engage in tendency reasoning in relation to the matters in Exhibit S.

70The appellant submitted that a miscarriage of justice had occurred because the trial judge gave no appropriate direction or warning to the jury at the time that Exhibit S was tendered and read to the jury. The appellant submitted that a warning not to engage in tendency reasoning should have been given by the judge to the jury at that time. The appellant submitted that because the judge failed to give such a direction at that critical time, there was a real risk of the jury misusing or misapplying Exhibit S.

71This submission should be rejected. In order to understand why, it is necessary to set out briefly the way in which the evidence was adduced at trial.

72The content of Exhibit S was first introduced when Senior Constable O'Connor gave her evidence on 3 November 2011. She was the officer to whom the deceased had complained and who had recorded the statement of the deceased in hospital on 23 October 2009. Once that evidence was given, the trial judge was concerned that an appropriate direction should be given to the jury as soon as possible. 

73Having discussed the matter with counsel, her Honour gave the direction on the morning of 4 November at a time when the evidence was fresh in the minds of the jury members. (The full direction is set out at [48] hereof.) As can be seen, her Honour's warning against the use of that evidence as tendency evidence was comprehensive and explicit. Accordingly, when Exhibit S was formally tendered on 10 November 2011 and read to the jury, the jury were already aware of its content and had already been given an appropriate direction by the trial judge. At that time, there was no request for any additional direction by senior counsel for the appellant. As already indicated, Exhibit S was tendered without objection and it was senior counsel for the appellant who requested that it be read to the jury at that time. In those circumstances, there was no requirement for the trial judge to give any additional direction. Moreover, further clear directions against engaging in tendency reasoning in relation to Exhibit S were given during the summing up, as can be seen at [52] and [53] hereof.

74It should be noted that no complaint was made concerning the content of the directions at trial or concerning a failure to give a direction at trial. For this submission to succeed, the appellant would have to obtain leave pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. No reason has been advanced why such leave should be given. Even if leave were given, for the reasons set out above, the submission should be rejected.

75It follows that the appellant has not made out his appeal against conviction and it should be dismissed.

Application for leave to appeal against sentence

76The appellant relies upon a single ground of appeal against sentence:

Ground 2: The finding by the Court that an aggravating feature of the sentence imposed for murder was the treatment of the corpse, has resulted in a sentence too severe in all the circumstances of the case.

Remarks on sentence

77In her Remarks on Sentence, McCallum J noted that the maximum penalty for the offence of murder is imprisonment for life and that the offence has a standard non-parole period of 20 years. Under s61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the imposition of a life sentence is mandated where the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. Her Honour was not satisfied that this offence fell within the terms of that section. Nevertheless, her Honour noted that the determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed was guided by both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period.

78Having reviewed the facts, her Honour found that by the time the telephone calls were made to the NAB on 17 April, the appellant had formed the intention to kill the deceased and was forcing her to make the calls so that he would have access to her bank account after her death.

79Her Honour was not satisfied that the appellant had dismembered the deceased's body only to facilitate its removal from his unit. Her Honour said:

""52 ... However it does not follow from those events that the offender had no other reason to deal with the body as he did. The object of disposing of the body may have been part of the reason for dismembering it, but other aspects of the autopsy evidence reveal a higher level of criminality.

53 Some parts of the body had been cut into pieces smaller than can sensibly be explained by the need to fit them into garbage bags. One of the deceased's feet had been cut into two pieces. Both hands had been cut off at the wrist. A little finger had been removed from one of the hands. Both nipples had been cut off, probably using a pair of scissors that were found in one of the bags. The front of the skull bore marks indicating that the face had been cut diagonally from right to left and left to right and across the midline of the skull. 

54 Those acts went beyond what was required to conceal the transport of a body. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender's treatment of the body was in part motivated by a desire to remove evidence of injuries inflicted by him. I am further satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that to some extent at least, the offender's treatment of the body was an expression of anger and hatred towards the deceased. I do not accept that this is merely emotive speculation, as submitted on behalf of the offender. The state of the body admits of no other conclusion in my view.

55 As noted by Johnson J in R v Wilkinson (No 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61], whilst care must be taken in examining events after the offence for the purpose of assessing its objective seriousness, circumstances which as a matter of common sense are directly related to the offence are properly regarded as informing that assessment. The offender's treatment of the deceased's body contributes to the overwhelming inference that he intended to kill her. 

56 It was acknowledged on behalf of the offender that his treatment of the body may be taken into account in assessing the seriousness of the offence: R v Yeo [2003] NSWSC 315 at [36]; Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; 164 A Crim R 126 at [28] and [29]. The offender's meticulous and disturbing dissection of his former companion into smaller parts to be dumped unceremoniously in the bush requires that the sentence be increased to some degree.""

80Her Honour noted that ""a further aggravating feature"" of the offence was that the appellant was on conditional liberty at the time the offence was committed, having been granted bail on 30 November 2009 for the alleged assault. Her Honour concluded that the appellant's sustained denial of his guilt removed any basis for a finding of remorse. On the basis of a psychologist's report, her Honour was prepared to find that he had a schizoid and depressive personality which might have impaired his ability to experience or articulate guilt or remorse in the ordinary way. Her Honour was not prepared to find that the appellant had good prospects of rehabilitation. It was against that background that her Honour passed the sentence which she did.

81The appellant submitted that her Honour erred by taking into account his treatment of the corpse after death as a matter of aggravation. The appellant submitted that to the extent that his sentence was increased for that reason, her Honour was in error. The appellant noted that he had not been charged with an offence contrary to s81C of the Crimes Act 1900, i.e. improperly interfering with a human corpse. The appellant noted that the treatment of a corpse after death did not fall within any of the categories of aggravation in s21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

82The appellant submitted that his post offence conduct was given excessive weight, and accordingly his sentence should be reduced. The appellant submitted that her Honour's findings as to the dissection of the corpse were not open to her, given the advanced state of decomposition of the body, to which the forensic pathologist had referred.

83The appellant's submissions on sentence should be rejected. As is clear from her Honour's Remarks on Sentence, a concession was made on behalf of the appellant ""that his treatment of the body may be taken into account in assessing the seriousness of the offence"". It is not open to the appellant to resile from that concession in this appeal.

84The point of distinction which the appellant sought to draw between the treatment of the deceased's corpse after death being a matter of aggravation rather than going to the seriousness of the offence, is a distinction without a difference. Whether it be regarded as an aggravating feature or as a matter going to the seriousness of the offence, it was open to the trial judge to take that matter into account as a factor tending towards an increase in the sentence. This is clear from the cases referred to by her Honour in her Remarks on Sentence.

85In R v Yeo, the offender having shot the deceased, severed his head from his body. The severed head and trunk, which may have been further dismembered, were removed from a home unit and disposed of. In his Remarks on Sentence in that matter, James J said:

""36 Similar submissions to the submissions which have been put to me in these proceedings on sentence were also put to Grove J in the proceedings on sentence after the first trial. In his remarks on sentence Grove J said that the dismemberment of the body and the disposal of the parts of the victim's body, although not ingredients of the crime of murder, were ""pertinent to the overall assessment of its seriousness"". I agree with his Honour that this conduct by Ms Yeo, which I have found occurred, can be taken into account in assessing the seriousness of the offence committed by Ms Yeo. See the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v England (1999) 106 A Crim R 99 at 103 to 109.""

86In Regina v Knight the offender had immediately after the murder meticulously skinned the corpse, dissected the body, arranged the remains in a contemptuous way, cooked the head and other parts and then prepared them in a meal for the deceased's children.

87In an appeal to this Court by the offender, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Latham J and Adams J agreed) said:

""28 The applicant submitted that her mutilation of the deceased's body following his death was not relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence. In my opinion this submission must be rejected. As this Court said in R v Yeo (2003) NSWSC 315 at [36] the offender's treatment of the deceased's body can be taken into account in assessing the seriousness of the offence (see also R v Garforth unreported, NSWCCA, 23 May 1994; DPP v England (1997) 186 A Crim R 99).

29 This was a violent and cruel crime during which the deceased must have suffered extreme trauma. He was stabbed numerous times. The violation of his body reveals an utter contempt for the deceased and for his children.""

88In the same case, Adams J said:

""64 I have already expressed my view about the culpability involved in the murder committed by the applicant. Although at first I was minded to think that too much had been made of her subsequent dealings with Mr Price's body, I have concluded, on reflection, that so extreme was this conduct and so closely linked in time and place was it with the killing that it must be regarded as an integral part of the killing itself. It demonstrates the extraordinary extent of the applicant's brutality and, perhaps of greater significance, her lack of what we might recognize as humane feelings, which were, I think, completely buried in unreasoning and irrational hatred for her victim.""

89As the decisions in Yeo and Knight make clear, the concession made on behalf of the appellant in the sentence proceedings, was appropriate. As a matter of fact, and for the reasons identified by Adams J in Knight, the trial judge was entitled to regard the appellant's treatment of the corpse as an integral part of the killing itself. As such, her Honour did not err in finding that this consideration impacted on the seriousness of the offending.

90Implicit in the appellant's submission that her Honour gave too much weight to this consideration is an acceptance that her Honour's assessment involved an exercise of discretion with which this Court has always been reluctant to interfere. In R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11] Spigelman CJ (with whom Grove and Hidden JJ agreed) said:

""Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge.""

91There have been many statements to similar effect in subsequent cases: Ryan v R [2009] NSWCCA 183 at [33]; Cao v R [2010] NSWCCA 109 at [57]; Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49; 219 A Crim R 550 at [25]; Gebara v R [2012] NSWCCA 107 at [16].

92There is no substance in the challenge to the trial judge's factual finding concerning the extent of the dismemberment as a result of the body's decomposition. The matters particularly referred to by her Honour were identified by the forensic pathologist in his evidence without qualification. Not only were these findings of fact open to her Honour, there was no evidence to the contrary.

93This ground of appeal has not been made out.

94The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) In relation to the conviction appeal, the appeal should be dismissed.

(2) In relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

95LATHAM J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL, both as to the orders he proposes and the reasons for them. I wish to add some comments with respect to the conduct of this appeal by counsel.

96As Hoeben CJ at CL has noted, the appellant was represented at trial by very experienced senior counsel. If I may be permitted to observe, that senior counsel appears regularly in Supreme Court murder trials. His experience is complemented by a thorough appreciation of the criminal law and the law of evidence in particular.

97It is against that background that the grounds of appeal and the application of Rule 4 to those grounds must be appreciated. In ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266, the Chief Justice summarised Rule 4 :-

""147 The effect of the rule was summarised by McHugh J in Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 as follows (at [72]): 

""There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant. Where the evidence was admissible, but the trial judge had a discretion to limit its use, the burden on the appellant is greater: the appeal can succeed only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the discretion would have been exercised in favour of the appellant and that, if it had, it is more likely than not that the appellant would have been acquitted ... "" 

148 Subsequent cases have established that the following matters are important in considering the operation of r 4: 
The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities. The Criminal Appeal Act does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial: R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, 319. See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170]. 

The appellant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21]. 

A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that counsel said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that counsel took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done: Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]-[13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [58]-[61]. 

An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130].""

98Hulme J re-visited this summary in FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 (McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreeing). 

99The failure of senior counsel at trial to object to the reference to the victim being punched in the eye by the appellant, and his failure to seek yet another direction warning the jury against tendency reasoning at the time that he suggested that the statement be read to the jury, are archetypal examples of forensic decisions taken in the atmosphere of the trial, which occasioned no injustice to the appellant. 

100This was, in my view, a completely unmeritorious appeal. Unfortunately, the maintenance of such appeals in this jurisdiction inevitably delays the listing of other conviction appeals with real prospects of success. 

101BEECH-JONES J: I agree with the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL and the orders his Honour proposes.

		27 September 2013",2013-09-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706092,R v Linda Maree Troutman [2013] NSWDC 316,"Judgment
1HER HONOUR: There is a trial before me, a judge alone trial, in which the accused has been arraigned on a charge contrary to s 112(2) that on 30 June 2012 she broke and entered the dwelling house of one Ahmed Camgoz and stole property from him there which included a passport, certificate of citizenship, Medicare card, Centrelink cards and a Nokia mobile phone. It is charged as an aggravated break, enter and steal on the basis of an allegation that she was armed with an offensive weapon at the time.

2Before the trial properly commences there has been a voir dire into the admissibility of certain evidence proposed to be led by the Crown. The Crown is seeking to lead two statements made by the accused to investigating officers at the scene of the offence at the time immediately after her arrest, which the Crown seeks to rely on as admissions. They are objected to on the basis of s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act which requires that in such circumstances any statements alleged to be admissions must be presented to the Court by way of a tape recording made by, in this case, the police officer, unless the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording could not be made.

3As briefly as possible the facts are, I accept, that a number of police officers were called to the premises at 55 Walker Street, Redfern at about 5.30 on Sunday 30 June 2012. One of those was Constable Rullis. He and another officer attended on the victim of this offence who, I accept, had not long beforehand been robbed by a woman inside his house and a number of his belongings taken. When the officer spoke to him he indicated a limited description, particularly referring to a facial feature of the woman and also told police that this same person had done it before. This occurred between 5.30 and 6.45pm.

4Constable Rullis then left and spoke to two other officers who had arrived, and then at about 6.40pm, with one of the other officers, went down to the ground floor to leave the building. He then saw three Aboriginal women walking through the foyer. The description of the perpetrator of the offence given by the victim was that she was an Aboriginal woman. One of those people turned around and the officer observed the same distinctive facial feature. He asked for them all to stop. He recognised one of them as being the accused in this trial and recognised her as a result of previous contact with her.

5He became suspicious of her on the basis of her demeanour. He asked for an ID but she didn't have any. He told her he had reason to believe that she had committed a break and enter shortly beforehand and was going to search her. She remonstrated. He asked her to put the bag down on a nearby bench. This all occurred in the foyer of the block of units near the letterboxes where there was a wooden slatted bench attached to the letterboxes. He asked if she had any sharp implements in her handbag. She said she did and that she would get them out. She then started to search in her bag for sharp items.

6Two other officers arrived on the scene and Constable Rullis asked for a female officer to be present to search the accused. He then claims that the accused turned her body so that she was blocking his view of her, searching in her shoulder bag. He asked her to stop. She didn't initially. Eventually he asked her to sit alongside on the bench and said he would search the bag. She did so, but there had been a short period of time in which his view of the handbag and what she was doing with it was obscured by her body.

7He started to search her bag on the bench and located a number of items in it, which do not appear to be relevant to this charge. The bag was close to the bottom of the mailboxes, one of which had a broken door and the interior was open. He noticed a blue passport sitting on top of what appeared to be other mail in that open letterbox, and also a plastic sleeve which contained what was in fact a certificate of Australian citizenship belonging to the victim. The passport was that of the victim as well. They were two items which he had just reported as having been stolen during the break and enter offence.

8Under each of those two documents, which were sitting at the top of the pile was a white piece of paper, which was a folded bail reporting slip in the name of the accused, indicating that at least somebody in that name had reported on bail at Redfern Police Station on 26 June 2012, that is four days earlier, at 7.42pm.

9He then had a conversation with the accused and asked her what the passport was. She said she did not know, and at that he arrested her for the break and enter. Again she remonstrated and said that she had nothing to do with it. He gave her the traditional caution and she continued to say she had nothing to do with it and that she understood the caution. He then asked two questions which are the subject of this application. He asked,

""How did this bail slip end up in the letterbox under the passport and Australian certificate of citizenship"", and she answered, ""My slip could have come out of the bag when I was looking for the fits"". 

10By that she meant the syringes that she was looking for or getting out of her bag.

11The Crown seeks to rely on this as an admission by her that the bail slip had been in her handbag immediately prior to her being stopped by the police and from that the Crown would ultimately seek an inference to be drawn that she had taken it from her handbag and placed it together with the passports of citizenship in the letterbox in an attempt to avoid being found in possession of them. I imagine the Crown's submission will be that the bail slip was put there by accident but connects her to the possession of the stolen items immediately before she was stopped, in a way that would amount to recent possession and be an important piece of evidence to convict her. Those inferences will no doubt be put and will be available, in any event, in this trial because the evidence of the finding and location of those documents will be in evidence before the Court. It is what is said to be her admission that she had possession of the bail slip in her handbag immediately beforehand - that is the admission the Crown seeks to rely on.

12The second question that was put, according to the statement immediately, thereafter is: 

""Who owns the ticket?"" 

13Referring to a pensioner excursion bus ticket, and the answer, 

""It's mine. Someone gave it to me in the city so I could catch the bus"". 

14This appears to refer to the finding of a pensioner excursion bus ticket together with a Centrelink pension document in the name of the victim in a bin nearby the point at which the accused was being questioned by police. The evidence before me is unclear and somewhat confusing about the timing of this and the detail, but as best I can ascertain the evidence would be that at some stage before Constable Rullis asked the question about the bus ticket some officer or other had found the victim's Centrelink pension document in a nearby bin together with a bus ticket.

15There is no evidence before me on this voir dire to suggest that that bus ticket belonged to the victim, nor why it was that the officer asked the accused who owned the bus ticket. There is no apparent connection between her and the bus ticket. In any event, the Crown seeks to rely on her answer ""It's mine"" as an admission that she was in possession of the bus ticket immediately before her apprehension by police as the basis for an inference that she was also in recent possession of the victim's Centrelink pension document because these two documents were found near each other in a bin; apparently discarded, not far from the accused.

16Neither of these two conversations was recorded by tape recording. There was a notebook recording of the conversations made but that does not overcome the requirements of s 281. In any event, there is some confusion about whether or not the recording of the relevant pieces of conversation was contemporaneous and more probably than not these conversations were not recorded until some two hours or so after they were had. But as I have said, that is beside the point, given that s 281 does not allow that as a substitution for a tape recording.

17So pursuant to s 281(2), evidence of such an admission is not admissible if a tape recording is not available. Therefore, on a prima facie basis, these admissions are not admissible, but may become admissible if the prosecution establishes that there was reasonable excuse as to why the tape recording could not be made.

18""Reasonable excuse"" is defined in s 281(4) as including a mechanical failure or a refusal to have questions electronically recorded. Neither of those applies here. It also includes the lack of availability of recording equipment within a period in which it would be reasonable to detain the person being questioned. As I understand it, that is the basis on which the Crown seeks to establish a reasonable excuse here. 

19I accept that the officer did not have a portable tape recorder. I accept that it is not the practice for officers to be issued with tape recorders in the field and that there is no approved tape recorder issued to officers to carry with them in circumstances like here, where they were responding to a report of a recent offence. I also accept that they did not expect to find the person who they suspected as having committed this offence when they attended. They were attending because of the report of a crime that had just occurred.

20However, I am not satisfied that the Crown has proved that there was a lack of availability of recording equipment within a period in which it would be reasonable to detain the person being questioned. The officer had, in fact, arrested the accused before he had these further conversations with her. He has agreed that Redfern police station, to which he was attached, was about a kilometre away.

21As a result of arresting the accused he was then obliged to take her to a police station as soon as possible and to enter her into custody complying with all the LEPRA provisions. He had already summoned a female police officer to attend to assist with the search of the accused at a time when he had already announced to the accused that he had reason to believe she had committed the break and enter involving the victim and that he was intending to search her in order to locate the stolen property. His request for a female officer was made after that time and it would have been possible for him to request her to attend with a tape recorder. There was no reason why they could not have remained at the scene whilst a tape recorder was obtained.

22Lest it be thought that the application of this section places investigating officers under unreasonable constraints, I accept that the legislative purpose for this provision was to ensure confidence in the administration of justice to overcome what, for a period of time in New South Wales, was seen to be a tendency to rely on alleged verbal admissions by accused and to ensure that there was in place a regime whereby such propositions could not be put to a Court again, to ensure ongoing confidence in the justice system.

23The provisions are strict and are meant to be so. I accept from the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal that they have been referred to as precise and rigorous requirements. That is a decision of the then Chief Justice in the R v Reid [1999] NSWCCA 258.

24The provisions do not seek to deter officers from investigating or in pursing investigations that they might think appropriate and Hulme J in R v White and Ors observed that in Reid's case the then Chief Justice observed that police investigations may proceed with such inquiries as the officers wish to pursue but, when it comes to tendering admissions made in the course of such investigations, precise and rigorous requirements of what was then the equivalent of s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act must be satisfied. In other words the Chief Justice sought to draw a distinction between the investigating role of the police and the reliance by the prosecuting authorities, in due course, on any admissions made during the course of such investigations.

25It has not been suggested in this trial that the officer adopted this course in any way that sought to trick the accused. On the face of it, more probably than not, the officer did not even turn his mind to the fact that the likely answer to the two questions he was asking, if admissions, may not have been admissible in subsequent Court proceedings.

26The fact that the accused elected to exercise her right to silence when taken back to the police station, of course even if he had turned his mind to it, would have made it more difficult because he was not in a position then to have her adopt that which she said. There has been no suggestion on this voir dire that his recollection or written record of what is alleged to have been said was not accurate. The question is whether or not the prosecution has established a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording of these admissions was not made.

27It may be that the outcome in this case would be different if the police were operating in a more remote area, where gaining access to a tape recorder was physically more difficult, but that is not the case here. There are good policy reasons why this particular provision ought be applied strictly and rigorously, and I am not satisfied that the prosecution has established a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording could not be made.

2706094,Singtel Optus v Almad [2013] NSWSC 1427,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Optus (as I shall call the plaintiffs collectively) has provided telecommunications services in Australia for a number of years. The supply of those services requires ""logistics"" support: the transport and warehousing of goods. The second plaintiff (Optus Administration) employed the third defendant (Mr Curtis) from September 1998 to December 2008, initially as ""Logistics Manager"" and, from July 2001, as ""General Manager - Logistics"". In the latter position, Mr Curtis was responsible for, among other things, procuring and managing the supply of transport and warehousing services for Optus' networks business. 

2Optus used brokers to source some logistics services. Initially, so far as the evidence goes, it used a company known as Transcoast Express (Transcoast). Later, it used a company known as MTM Transport and Logistics (MTM). Later still, it used the first defendant (Almad). Mr Philip Davey was the common link: he was (either in his own right or through Almad) a commission sales agent for Transcoast and later MTM, and the principal of Almad. It was Mr Davey who had a connection with Optus which enabled him to procure the brokerage of some of its logistic work for, successively, those companies. 

3From about March 2004, Mr Curtis caused the second defendant (Sumo), a company whose creation he had brought about, and whose business he effectively controlled (although not formally a director) to provide some warehousing services to Optus. This he did through Almad as broker. Mr Curtis did not reveal to his superiors at Optus, let alone seek their approval for, this activity. It is clear that, in acting as he did, Mr Curtis breached various contractual, fiduciary and statutory duties that he owed to one or other or more of the plaintiffs. 

4The third defendant (Mr Hasler) was employed by Optus Administration as Outbound Operations Manager (reporting to Mr Curtis), from May 2001 to March 2005. Mr Hasler assisted, or worked with, Mr Curtis in the creation of Sumo and the establishment of its warehouse business. After Mr Hasler left the employ of Optus, he worked full time for Sumo, effectively managing its day to day operations. 

5The fifth defendant (the parties referred to it by its business name, ""Electrosales"", and I shall do likewise) is a corporate entity controlled entirely by Mr Curtis. He used Electrosales to sell obsolete or surplus stock of Optus to companies in America. The business records created by Mr Curtis in relation to that sale make it clear that the stock that was sold was stock owned by Optus. Mr Curtis says, however, that the stock had been owned by another company known as Megatron, which was in liquidation and which effectively had given the stock to Electrosales to dispose of on its own account and as it saw fit. 

6As might be expected, the matters that I have briefly summarised have given rise to claims by Optus against the various defendants. It should be noted, in addition to what I have said, that: 

(1) Optus says that in all the circumstances, Almad was required to disclose to it, but did not disclose, that Mr Curtis, through Sumo, was on the other end of supply transactions brokered by Almad for Optus, and that Almad's failure to make that disclosure amounts to misleading or deceptive conduct; 

(2) Sumo has failed to account for, and thus should be taken to have converted, some millions of dollars' worth of Optus stock that it had stored; and

(3) there is another claim in conversion against Electrosales, which claim is admitted, in the sum of $15,000.00. 

The real issues in dispute 

7The parties agreed on the real issues in dispute that arose from the ""pleadings"". I set those issues out, with some amendments to delete claims that were dropped, progressively, in the course of the hearing: 

1. Whether the third defendant (Mr Curtis) was in breach of:

a. his fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs (Optus);
b. his statutory duty under either sections 182 or 193 or both of the Corporations Act (2001) (Cth); or 
c. his employment contract with the third plaintiff (Optus Administration),

including by placing himself in a position in which his personal interest were in conflict with the interests of Optus. 

2. If so, whether one or more of the second defendant (Sumo), the fourth defendant (Mr Hasler) and the fifth defendant (Electrosales) was knowingly involved or concerned in the said breach of fiduciary or statutory duty by Mr Curtis. 

3. Whether Almad was in breach of its contract with the first plaintiff (SingTel Optus) by overcharging in respect of the rates charged per pallet. 

4, Whether Almad was liable for misleading and deceptive conduct under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (TPA) for failing to disclose to Optus the conduct of Mr Curtis, Mr Hasler or Sumo when it would have been reasonable for it do so. 

5. If so, whether any one or more of Sumo, Mr Curtis or Mr Hasler is liable pursuant to section 75B of the TPA in relation to the said contravention of the TPA. 

6. In relation to the claims for conversion and bailment, whether:

a. Sumo is liable in respect of the missing stock referred to at FACLS [37];
b. either Sumo or Electrosales or both are liable in respect of the sale of Optus stock to Telecycling LLC. 

7. Whether Optus is entitled to relief and, if so, the appropriate form of relief. 


8Sumo is in liquidation. Optus was given leave to proceed against Sumo. Sumo chose not to defend the claims made against it. 

9For convenience, when I refer hereafter to the represented defendants (Almad, Mr Curtis, Mr Hasler and Electrosales) together, I shall call them simply ""the defendants""; but it should be remembered that this appellation does not include Sumo. 

10For reasons that remain unexplained, the defendants' written closing submissions did not address in terms the issues that had been agreed. Nor was that deficiency rectified, except intermittently and, I think, by chance, in oral closing submissions. That is unfortunate. It may well be that, given the way those submissions were structured, I have not appreciated the relationship between a particular submission and a particular issue. 

11It is not acceptable for parties to ignore the agreed issues. Agreed issues serve a number of purposes. First, they distil the pleadings, reducing them to the real issues for decision. Secondly, they assist the parties and the court in the conduct of the trial (for example, in relation to questions of admissibility of evidence). Thirdly, they provide a guide, or road map, to resolution of the parties' disputes. To conduct a case without referring in terms to the agreed issues is no more sensible then driving in unknown country without referring to a map. It does not seem to me to be consistent with the obligations that parties and their legal representatives owe to the court under s 56 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) for litigation to be conducted in this way. 

The claims for relief 

12In the course of final submissions, Optus prepared a schedule summarising the claims for relief made by the various plaintiffs against the various defendants. I set those out, with some minor changes to reflect obvious and uncontentious errors:

Assessment of credibility 

13Although much of the evidence is documentary, there is, nonetheless, a substantial body of testimonial evidence that requires consideration. Some of that evidence is contentious. It is thus necessary to make an assessment of the credibility of the witnesses whose evidence is contentious, and whose credibility has been called into question. 

14I start by observing that, with one exception, there was no attack on the credibility of the witnesses called by Optus; indeed, some of them were not required for cross-examination (and the affidavit of another, which Optus did not read, was tendered without objection, and thus admitted into evidence, by the defendants). It follows that, so far as it goes, and acknowledging the obvious limitations that attend any attempt to recall events that occurred some years ago, I accept the evidence of those ""unimpeached"" witnesses. 

The evidence of Mrs Grech 

15The exception - the witness of fact called by Optus whose credibility was called into question - is Mrs Brooke Grech. 

16Mrs Grech was a director of MTM from January 2002 (when it came into existence) until September 2009 (when it went into liquidation; it has since been deregistered). She was called principally to give evidence of conversations that, she said, she had had with Mr Davey. One of those conversations (set out in para 7 of her affidavit) could only have been relevant to credibility, and (being objected to) was rejected. 

17In para 8 of her affidavit, Mrs Grech gave evidence of what, according to her, had been said at one of MTM's ""regular monthly management meetings"", held in about January 2004. Mrs Grech said that her husband Mr Darren Grech, Mr Andrew Moyle (another principal of MTM), and Mr Moyle's wife, Mrs Sharon Moyle and sister-in-law, Ms Melinda Woollen, attended the meeting. Mr and Mrs Grech and Mr Moyle, were directors of MTM. None of those people was called.

18Mrs Grech gave what purported to be a verbatim account, in direct speech, of a conversation between her and Mr Davey at the meeting. I return to this evidence at [81] and following below. At present, it is sufficient to note that Mrs Grech's evidence was given more than nine years after the conversation is said to have occurred. 

19There is no suggestion that Mrs Grech had made, let alone refreshed her memory from, a contemporaneous note of the meeting. So far as the evidence goes, she was relying on unaided recollection. 

20Human experience makes it difficult to accept that anyone could give an accurate account of a conversation that had occurred over nine years ago: at least, without relying on some contemporaneous materials to support the recollection. The evidence did not come to light until after the commencement of the hearing. Presumably, it occurred to someone among Optus' legal advisers to contact Mrs Grech and obtain an affidavit from her. There is no reason to think that she had been asked, more recently than late July 2013, to cast her mind back more than nine years to the events recounted in the relevant paragraph of her affidavit. 

21Further, as the cross-examination of Mrs Grech demonstrated, MTM and Mr Davey had parted company on acrimonious terms (Mr Davey's services were provided to MTM through Almad, but nothing turns on this). And, just as Mr Davey had brought the business of Optus and others to MTM when he left Transcoast, so, when he left MTM, he took that business with him. As events showed, the volume of that business was of the order of $18 million over the ensuing 6 years. MTM operated as a broker, charging a 20% markup on services that it procured for Optus. Thus, the broker's share of that lost business was one-sixth, or $3 million. 

22I have little doubt that it was the loss of the business that departed with Mr Davey that led ultimately to the liquidation of MTM. Further, although Mr and Mrs Grech thereafter set up a ""Phoenix"" business, seeking to capitalise on the connections that they had formed while working in MTM's business, that business too failed. 

23In those circumstances, I think that, although Mrs Grech denied it, she harbours considerable ill will towards Mr Davey, and that this was reflected both in her willingness to give evidence effectively against him and, also, in her asserted ability to recall the detail of the conversation.

24Mr Stoljar of Senior Counsel, who appeared with Mr Mackay of Counsel for Optus, submitted that there was significant corroboration for her evidence in an email that Mr Hasler sent to Mr Curtis on 5 July 2004. Since the significance to be attached to that email was itself contentious, I shall return to this aspect of Mrs Grech's evidence when dealing with that email. (see at [92] and following below). 

25For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that I think that there is substance in the challenge directed to Mrs Grech's credibility. I am not prepared to accept, without reservation and at face value, this aspect of her evidence. In reaching this conclusion, I take into account not just the matters already discussed but also what I say at [86] to [90] below. 

The defendants' evidence 

26Not all of the defendants' evidence was contentious. The affidavits of two witnesses, Mr Mark Barber and Mr Kevin Farrington, were read without the deponents being required to attend for cross-examination. It follows that I accept their evidence, so far as it goes. 

27To a greater or lesser extent, the evidence of the remaining witnesses was called into question. Those witnesses were Mr Curtis, Mr Hasler, the latter's son Mr Trent Hasler, Mr Michael Tull and Mr Davey. I shall deal with each of those in sequence. 

Mr Curtis 

28Mr Curtis swore a number of affidavits, one of which was of prodigious length. He was cross-examined in detail over a number of days. 

29I am not prepared to accept Mr Curtis as, in general, a witness on whose evidence I can place any reliance. I say that for a number of reasons. 

30First, in acting as he did to set up Sumo and direct some of Optus' business to it, Mr Curtis acted in a way that, he must have recognised, was in breach of duties to Optus. Further, no doubt in an attempt to rationalise this, Mr Curtis gave an excuse for his actions which I find to be false. He said, in effect, that his superior Mr Ray Badnall had given him a very poor performance and development rating (PDR) - PDR 5 - the lowest possible on the Optus scale. Mr Curtis said, by reference to the fate of another employee who had been similarly rated, that he feared that he would be ""managed out"" (as I understand it, a euphemism for termination of employment). Mr Curtis said that he set up the Sumo business to provide a source of livelihood in the event that he was ""managed out"". 

31However, Mr Badnall said that he thought that Mr Curtis was ""a very capable manager"" and could not ""recall ever giving him a bad review or a poor PDR rating"". Mr Badnall was not cross-examined. 

32Optus tendered what it said were, and appeared to be, printouts of screen dumps of the PDRs performed from year to year on Mr Curtis. In none of those was Mr Curtis assigned a PDR 5 rating. On the contrary, his ratings were generally PDR 2 or PDR 3. Mr Curtis, confronted by these records, sought to suggest that there were other records which contained other, poorer, ratings. Quite why Optus would keep two sets of PDR rating records, one apparently favourable to the employee and one unfavourable, was something that Mr Curtis did not seek to explain. Nor was any attempt made to identify, or require the production of, those other records that, according to Mr Curtis, would have shown the true situation. 

33As I have said, I think that the explanation that he gave, to justify his actions, was false. So too, in my view, was his attempt to explain away the satisfactory PDRs that were proved. 

34In relation to the Electrosales transaction, Mr Curtis created business records, including an invoice from Optus to the purchaser, an American company known as Telecycling, which stated clearly that the stock the subject of the sale was the property of Optus. Mr Curtis admitted to dishonest activity in connection with this sale. That of itself does him no credit, although it may be said that his admission, no doubt when the game was seen to be up, might help to redeem him. But, in relation to the business records showing a sale by Optus of its own stock, Mr Curtis gave an explanation which I find to be false. 

35According to Mr Curtis, it was necessary that Telecycling be assured that the stock was the stock of Optus, since otherwise it might not proceed with the purchase. Yet it was clear, from his and other evidence, that representatives of Telecycling had been shown the stock (which was located in the warehouse then operated by Sumo at Smithfield), and had become aware that, as the pallets of stock were plainly branded, it was apparently stock of Megatron. 

36I find the admitted and proved conduct of Mr Curtis, in relation to the Telecycling sale, to be inconsistent with any reasonable standard of honesty; and I regard his purported rationalisation of that dishonesty as, itself, false and dishonest. 

37In general, I am not prepared to accept the evidence of Mr Curtis on any contentious point unless it is corroborated by other, acceptable, evidence; or unless it accords with the probabilities as, objectively, I see them. 

Mr Hasler 

38For convenience, I shall refer to Mr Hasler Senior as ""Mr Hasler"" and to his son as ""Mr Trent Hasler"".

39Mr Rayment of Queens Counsel, who appeared with Mr Johnson and Ms King of Counsel for the defendants, submitted that I should find that Mr Hasler was a credible witness. I am not prepared to do so. 

40It appeared to me, in the course of Mr Hasler's cross-examination, that he had very little actual recollection of relevant events. That, in my view, may be seen in his repeated professions of non-recollection. 

41There is a further and specific problem with Mr Hasler's evidence. I have referred at [24] to an email that he sent to Mr Curtis on 5 July 2004. That email recorded, among other things, a conversation which Mr Hasler said he had had that very day with Mr Davey. When the substance of the conversation was put to Mr Hasler, he denied it. At first, it was apparent that the denial reflected the fact that he could not recall what was put to him. But it became apparent very shortly that the denial went further. Of course, when the email was then shown to Mr Hasler, he was forced to admit that the conversation had indeed taken place. 

42To my mind, that passage of Mr Hasler's cross-examination provides a striking example of what I perceived to be a propensity on his part to answer in a way that he thought might be suitable to his interests, without paying sufficient attention to the veracity of what he said. 

43Nonetheless, I do not reject Mr Hasler's evidence entirely. On the contrary, as will become apparent in discussing the issues, there were passages of his evidence that I do regard as essentially truthful. 

Mr Trent Hasler

44Mr Trent Hasler impressed me as a witness who had a reasonable recollection of events and who sought to give honest and accurate evidence. Acknowledging the fallibility of human memory, nonetheless I regard Mr Trent Hasler as a reliable and truthful witness.

Mr Tull 

45Mr Tull is another witness who was asked, after the commencement of the proceedings, to cast his mind back some number of years and give evidence of what had happened. He said (and I return to his evidence at [192] and following below) that he had been engaged from about July to December 2005 in moving goods from Sumo's Campbelltown warehouse to its new warehouse premises at Lidcombe. 

46Mr Tull acknowledged, candidly and appropriately, the limitations on his memory, and the possibility of error. Nonetheless, particularly bearing in mind some corroborative material to which he referred (and again, I shall return to this), he struck me as a witness who was seeking to give honest and reliable evidence to the best of his ability. 

47I accept Mr Tull as a witness of truth, and as someone on whose evidence I can place reliance. 

Mr Davey 

48Mr Davey gave evidence in a straightforward way. In general, he impressed me as a careful and capable businessman, with a good recollection of what he perceived to be the relevant events. 

49As I say below, in dealing with the claim against Almad for misleading or deceptive conduct (issue 4), I do not think that Mr Davey was inclined to give close scrutiny to matters of ethical or moral significance in the business practices of those with whom he dealt. But it does not follow that Mr Davey is an unreliable witness, let alone that he is dishonest. 

50Mr Davey was cross-examined about the conversation recounted in the email of 5 July 2004. He said that he could not recollect it. That is not surprising; there is no particular reason why he should have recollected it. Thus, I do not find his non-recollection to be suspicious, even when contrasted with what appeared to be his generally good powers of recollection. I think that Mr Davey focused his attention on his business, that his recollection of what, in his view, was relevant to the business is good, and that his recollection of what to him were likely to have been peripheral matters has faded. 

51On balance, and bearing in mind that Mr Davey has had an obvious and very significant financial interest in the outcome of the proceedings, I conclude that he is a witness who sought to give truthful evidence, and on whose evidence, in general, I can rely. 

History: the early days 

52Before turning to the issues, I shall set out the relevant history. Most of this is non-contentious, although of course the parties were not always of one mind as to the emphasis to be given to, or significance of, particular events. Where there is dispute, I shall deal with it.

53What follows is based substantially on a chronology and summary of facts provided by Mr Stoljar in his final submissions. I have taken that course because, to a large extent, there was no challenge to either the sufficiency or the accuracy of Mr Stoljar's narration of the relevant primary facts. 

54Mr Curtis started working for Optus in about September 1998, initially in the position of Logistics Manager. He signed written undertakings on 9 November 1998, and (on 30 November 1998) a written offer of employment. Those documents made it clear that, among other things, although Mr Curtis was employed by Optus Administration, his duties as an employee were owed not only to that company but also to its related bodies corporate. 

55The contract of employment stipulated that Mr Curtis would not act in conflict with the best interest of Optus Administration, nor compete with it or its related bodies corporate; and that he would comply with all its policies as in force from time to time. I set out the relevant parts:

You [Mr Curtis] must serve the Company faithfully and diligently; act in the best interests of the Company and its Related Bodies Corporate (as defined in the Corporations Law); not act in conflict with the Company's best interests or compete with the Company or its Related Bodies Corporate; and comply with all Company policies and applicable laws in force from time to time. 

56Optus proved a ""Procurement Ethics Policy"" dated 6 June 2000. There is no doubt that this was a ""Company policy"" of the kind that Mr Curtis undertook to obey. Section 2 of that Procurement Ethics Policy dealt with conflict of interest. It reads as follows:

2. Conflict of Interest 

It is essential that Optus employees and non payroll staff do nothing that conflicts with the interests of Optus, or anything that could be construed as being in conflict. 

Contracts and agreements must always be checked to ensure that conflict of interest is not present, and cannot be implied. 

2.1 Business Dealings 

Business dealings which are in conflict with the interests of Optus must be avoided. Business dealings which may result in a conflict of interest include significant ownership of shares in, holding a position or having any interest in or dealings with any of our competitors, suppliers or customers which might, or might appear to, create a conflict of interest, or impair the judgments of an Optus employee. 


2.2 Personal Dealings 

Any personal dealings with third parties outside of the Optus work environment that may possibly affect judgement with regard to work matters, must be reported to the individuals manager. On no account should Optus' business be discussed outside of the work environment. 

57To jump ahead for a moment: when Mr Curtis was involved in the evaluation of a request for tender (RFT) OCT-881, he signed ""Core Evaluation Team Undertakings"". By those undertakings, he agreed among other things that he had read and understood the Procurement Ethics Policy. He also agreed as follows:

2. I have specifically disclosed to Optus (in writing) any conflict of interest I have in the subject matter of the RFT other than as an Optus employee or contractor and any information or circumstances which may affect my ability to evaluate the RFT. If at any time during the evaluation, I come to have any interest of that kind, I undertake to immediately disclose that interest to Optus, in writing. 

58Before Mr Curtis started to work for Optus, he had worked for Nestlé Australia and, before that, for Woolworths. It was in the course of his employment by Woolworths that Mr Curtis met Mr Hasler. 

59About 8 months before Mr Curtis started to work for Optus, he became a director of Electrosales. Electrosales (more precisely, the company PJC 333 Pty Ltd) was a company that had been set up by Mr Curtis' father-in-law, Mr Peter Curtis, to manage the latter's accountancy practice. When Mr Peter Curtis retired and the company ceased to perform any useful function for him, Mr (Leon) Curtis took it over. 

60In late 1999, Mr Curtis became involved in a project known as N559-Insourcing. That project investigated bringing back into the direct control of Optus its warehousing activities (or a substantial part of them). It was contemplated that substantial savings could be effected if this were done. However, in April 2000, Optus decided that the project would not proceed. 

61Mr Curtis said that, as a result of this, he was given a bad PDR rating by his manager Mr Badnall. That, according to Mr Curtis, was what led to the decision to establish Sumo. I have referred to this at [30] to [33] above, in dealing with the question of credibility. 

62Mr Curtis effectively recruited Mr Hasler to work at Optus. In April 2001, Optus Administration made an offer of employment to Mr Hasler, to be its Outbound Operations Manager. Mr Hasler accepted that offer and commenced work, reporting to Mr Curtis, in May 2001. 

63Mr Curtis became General Manager - Logistics on 16 July 2001. He said that this was more a change of title than a change of responsibility. 

64Optus submitted that, in this position, Mr Curtis was a ""senior employee"". Mr Curtis did not accept that characterisation of his importance. Regardless of terminology, it is clear that, as General Manager - Logistics, Mr Curtis had very substantial duties and responsibilities. A ""position description"" prepared by Mr Curtis in January 2004 said that:

The GM Logistics is responsible for the functional control and operation of all materials purchase, planning, storage and movements for SingTel OPTUS network builds and assurance. 

65In that position Mr Curtis had five people reporting to him directly and, on average, about 30 people under his direct or indirect control (the number fluctuated, mainly by diminution, over time). 

66In September 2001, Transcoast became ""the preferred carrier"" for Optus. This appears to have been achieved because Mr Davey had moved from Mayne Nickless to Transcoast, and had taken his connections (including for Optus business) with him. 

67In November 2001, a company known as Optus Stockco Pty Ltd signed an agreement with Megatron Electronic Industries Pty Ltd under which Megatron agreed to take from Optus Stockco and sell, for their mutual benefit, ""obsolete, redundant or surplus electronic products"". 

68The Megatron agreement (as it is convenient to call it) provided that title would pass to Megatron on collection of the goods and on payment of a notional amount of $1 per item (later, I think, changed to $1 per pallet load). It provided, further, that Optus could buy back all or any part of the equipment at its discretion, paying the like fee. 

69In March 2002, Mr Hasler undertook a review of Optus' freight and distribution services. It recommended that MTM be used, in place of Transcoast; and this was done. Again, I think, this happened because Mr Davey moved from Transcoast to MTM, and took his business connections with him. 

70In late November 2002, after a tender process, a company known as Computer Logistics Pty Limited started to provide the bulk of Optus' warehousing and freight requirements. Computer logistics was bought out by United Parcel Service (UPS). 

MTM becomes a supplier

71Although UPS appears to have been the preferred provider of Optus' warehousing and freight needs, MTM submitted quotations to Optus for such work, and provided services to Optus. Those services included the provision of warehouse space by a company known as Cargo and Logistics Management, generally referred to by the acronym CALM. 

72Optus became dissatisfied with the services provided by CALM, in particular because some Optus products stored at CALM's warehouse became coated by a ""black chalky substance"". That substance was carbon black, which CALM apparently stored in bulk and bagged as needed for distribution. Perhaps not surprisingly, some of the carbon black carbon escaped during this process and settled on other goods stored in the warehouse. 

73Optus says that Mr Curtis, if he did not go so far as to manufacture the complaint about CALM's services, nonetheless used it as an excuse to terminate the arrangements with CALM and to insert Sumo as a supplier of warehousing services. The underlying facts are not in dispute. 

Sumo comes into existence

74According to Mr Hasler, he had been thinking from early 2004 about setting up a warehousing business. Mr Hasler said that he had had discussions with Mr Davey about this. Mr Hasler said that he then discussed the proposal with Mr Curtis, on the basis that any services to be supplied by the new venture would have to be better, and no more expensive, than the services provided by CALM. 

75By 12 January 2004, Mr Curtis or Mr Hasler had had meetings with a real estate agent who represented the owner of warehouse premises at Campbelltown. Ultimately and for a time, Sumo conducted its business from those premises. 

76On 16 January 2004, Mr Curtis and Mr Hasler registered Sumo as a business name. Mr Hasler ""would assume"" that by that time, he and Mr Curtis had decided to proceed with their project. 

77On 28 January 2004, Mr Curtis asked Mr Hasler to attend at Campbelltown Council in connection with the development consent for the warehouse. It is not clear if Mr Hasler did so. 

78On 15 March 2004, the Campbelltown warehouse premises were leased to the wives of Mr Curtis and Mr Hasler, for the benefit of Sumo (at that stage, still operating as a partnership between Mr Curtis and Mr Hasler). 

79Sumo (the company) was incorporated on 23 March 2004. Mr Curtis said that, by then, the Sumo warehousing business had been operated in partnership between him and Mr Hasler for some five weeks. 

Sumo becomes a supplier to Optus 

80Returning to CALM: there were meetings in December 2003 and January 2004 between representatives of Optus and representatives of MTM (Mr Alex Harmanis and Mr Farrington for Optus, and Mr Davey and Mr Moyle for MTM). Concerns were expressed at the ""black chalky substance"". 

81On 28 January 2004, Mr Curtis wrote to MTM, identifying Optus' complaints and requiring that they be addressed. That position was reinforced in a further meeting which took place two days later, on 30 January 2004. The minutes of that meeting show that Mr Davey had until 28 February 2004 to address the problems with CALM. However, as the preceding chronology of events might suggest, by then Mr Curtis had made up his mind to terminate the services of CALM. 

82It was at about this time (January 2004) that, according to Mrs Grech, the conversation took place in which she raised, with Mr Davey among others, concerns at the idea that Mr Curtis and Mr Hasler were involved, through their interest in Sumo, with the supply of services to their employer, Optus. Mrs Grech did not suggest that Mr Hasler was present at that meeting. 

83In his affidavit sworn on 13 March 2013, Mr Hasler said at para 44 that he and Mr Curtis met ""personnel from MTM"" at a meeting ""in early 2004"". According to Mr Hasler, the only issue raised by Mrs Grech was that services provided in replacement for those offered by CALM would have to be at a lower rate than charged by CALM. Further, according to Mr Hasler, either he or Mr Curtis asked whether anyone saw a problem and that the (I interpolate, only) reply, ""no"", came from Mr Davey. 

84Mrs Grech gives an account of a very different conversation: one that did not involve Messrs Curtis and Hasler. In para 8 of her affidavit sworn 1 August 2013, Mrs Grech said that there was a conversation at one of MTM's ""regular monthly management meetings"", in which Mr Davey said that the supplier of warehouse services to Optus was to change. According to Mrs Grech, the conversation was to the following effect:

8. In approximately January 2004, MTM held one of its regular monthly management meeting. I recall that Mr Davey, my husband, Mr Moyle, his wife Mrs Sharon Moyle and Ms Melinda Woollen, Mr Moyle's sister in law all attended the meeting. It was our usual practice at these regular monthly management meetings to discuss how business was going, existing clients' needs, supplier issues, customer service and any account issues. At this particular meeting, I recall that Mr Davey brought up changing warehouse providers for Optus. I recall we had a conversation in words to he following effect: 

Davey: At the request of Optus we are going to relocate all the Optus stock from CALM to another warehouse. 

Me: Why would we do that?

Davey: Optus has instructed us to. 

Me: Who is the new supplier?

Davey: Sumo Distribution and Storage. 

Me: Where is it and who operate it?

Davey: Craig Hasler and Leon Curtis will be running it. 

Me: How can Craig and Leon run a warehouse storing Optus stock while they are still working for Optus? Surely that's a conflict of interest? 

Davey: That's got nothing to do with us. 

Me: I am not comfortable with this at all. I don't see how it can be legal and I don't want to get involved. I can't imagine Optus consenting to this arrangement. 

Davey: This is nothing to do with us. They will invoice us and we will invoice Optus and Optus will pay us the same as before.

Me: I don't care. I don't like it and I want to understand more. 

Davey: Leon Curtis and Craig Hasler have set it up as a partnership and got a warehouse. Our invoices will be paid and approved as normal. 

Me: There is no way we can do business with them. It's not an acceptable business arrangement and I am worried about the effect this may have on MTM and its reputation. 

Mr Davey: They will sort it out and make sure that there are no problems. 

85Mrs Grech's affidavit did not deal with the conversation said by Mr Hasler to have occurred at about the same time. It might have been expected (because Mrs Grech's affidavit was sworn more than four months after Mr Hasler's affidavit was sworn) that Mrs Grech would have been asked to deal with this aspect of Mr Hasler's evidence. 

86However, Mrs Grech was cross-examined on the conversation to which Mr Hasler had deposed. Her cross-examination on this evidence is somewhat lengthy. However, it should be set out in full (T235.41-238.9):

Q. Do you recall seeing at the MTM premises in the first half of 2004 Leon Curtis and Craig Hasler?
A. I do remember seeing them, yes. 

Q. I suggest to you what was happening at that meeting was there was an enquiry made by Curtis and Hasler as to whether they set up a new business of warehousing and did it at the same price as CALM had been doing it. First of all, you would put that work to them, do you agree with that?
A. No.
Q. I suggest to you further that at the meeting you were asked whether not only would you put that work to them but could put other warehousing work to them. Do you agree with that?
A. I don't remember that part of the conversation, no.

Q. I suggest that you said that if you were to deal with them they would have to do it at $2.30, being less than the CALM price per pallet?
A. I would say no because I did not negotiate rates, it was not my role.

Q. You had nothing to do with that?
A. I did not get involved normally with that.

Q. You are certain?
A. The only time I would be asked was if it was a cost analysis but I don't remember being the negotiator of the rates. 

Q. Apart from that general recollection would you deny that you said at that meeting that you would have to do it at $2.30 and you said, ""We set the price, not you""?
A. I don't remember.

Q. You are not sure one way or the other?
A. No, I don't remember.

Q. I suggest to you that at the meeting the prospect was held out to Curtis and Hasler that your company might provide other warehousing business to them if they set up?
A. We weren't doing any warehousing at that stage with anybody else. We weren't involved in warehousing. I don't know what other work we would have given them, if that was the suggestion. 

Q. Was it said to them that you had some customers who might have warehousing needs and your company would look at providing that business to them if they started up?
A. I don't believe I said that in any way.

Q. Was it said in your presence?
A. I don't remember that being said any way.

Q. What I suggest to you is that neither you nor anyone else present at the meeting which we have just been discussing asked any questions about any problems that this might pose for Optus or otherwise?
A. Can you repeat that?

Q. You did not say at this meeting that you had with Curtis and Hasler that there was any problem that you saw about dealing between MTM and Sumo?
A. Yes I did.

Q. Did you say that to them?
A. I had very clear conversations with our people within our business.
Q. No, whether you said it to them? You did not say to Curtis or Hasler, ""We have some problem about dealing with you because you are still at Optus""?
A. I believe I did, actually. 

Q. You did?
A. I believe that conversation was had in a meeting with them, yes.

Q. With them?
A. Yes.

Q. That is one you have not referred to in your affidavit, that conversation you have not mentioned in your affidavit?
A. There was more than one meeting and more than one person at any one meeting.

Q. I put it to you that no problem was raised with Curtis or Hasler about dealings between MTM and Sumo?
A. That's incorrect.

HIS HONOUR

Q. Am I to understand that you do remember having a conversation with Mr Curtis and Mr Craig Hasler about the topic of their doing warehousing work for Optus at some time in early 2004? Is that correct?
A. Yes, definitely. 

RAYMENT

Q. Do you say that you said to them, ""We wouldn't deal with you""?
A. I don't remember the exact wording. 

Q. I am asking you did you say to them, ""We wouldn't deal with you""?
A. I don't remember the exact wording, I am sorry.

Q. Did you say to them, ""We will deal with another warehouse but not with you,"" anything like that?
A. No, I said I don't remember the exact wording but I did express concern. 

Q. About dealing with them?
A. Yes.

Q. Did you say that you had concerns about dealing with them?
A. Yes.

Q. And that you wouldn't deal with them?
A. I said I had concerns about dealing with them.

Q. But you didn't say, ""We won't deal with you""?
A. I don't remember those words exactly but I did say I have concerns. 

Q. Did you give them to understand that you would not deal with them?
A. I am sorry?

Q. Did you say anything to indicate to them that you would not deal with them? You didn't, did you?
A. I don't remember the exact wording of the conversation but I did very clearly state that I expressed concerns about dealing with them.

Q. That wasn't sufficient to stop you?
A. I am not the only decision maker of the business. 


87The very strong impression that I get from this passage of Mrs Grech's evidence is that her memory of conversations involving Mr Curtis and Mr Hasler, or involving their business Sumo, is not nearly as clear as the asserted recollection of the particular conversation given in para 8 of her affidavit, on which Optus placed much reliance. The conversation set out in para 8 of the affidavit is not one said to have involved as parties Mr Curtis or Mr Hasler. By contrast, in her cross-examination (in particular from T236.39-237.13), Mrs Grech does assert that there was a conversation with Messrs Curtis and Hasler present, in which she expressed concerned at their being involved, as it were, on both sides of the warehousing transaction. No such conversation had found expression in her affidavit. 

88Considering the evidence of Mrs Grech as a whole, and taking into account, to the extent that it is a help, her demeanour and the way she gave her evidence, I have the very strong impression, that she has, unconsciously and without any subjective intent to deceive, conflated various conversations (more accurately, her present recollection of scraps of them) with her thoughts both at the time and since concerning the relevant events, and that she has reconstructed, in what purports to be a record of a single conversation, an amalgam comprising aspects of those scraps and thoughts. I have little doubt that this process of reconstruction has been influenced, whether intentionally or otherwise, by the matters referred to at [21] and [22] above and by the ill will to which I referred at [23] above. 

89Whilst I have no doubt that, subjectively, Mrs Grech was seeking to be honest in saying that she remembered the particular conversation set out in para 8 of her affidavit, I am not satisfied that her evidence of that conversation should be accepted. Nor am I satisfied that her evidence, tentative and general as it was, of other conversations (not referred to in her affidavit) in which she claimed to have expressed doubts to Messrs Curtis and Hasler as to the propriety of what they were doing, should be accepted. 

90If Mrs Grech had held the view expressed in the conversation to which she deposed at para 8 of her affidavit, one would expect her to have had considerable hesitation in dealing with Sumo. However, as Mr Rayment pointed out, MTM continued to deal with Sumo notwithstanding her alleged reservations (see at [98] to [108] below). It cannot be suggested that this was due purely to Mr Davey's intervention or influence, because some dealings continued well after he left MTM in about February 2005. MTM's apparent willingness to continue to deal with Sumo does not seem to me to be consistent with the reservations that, Mrs Grech said, she both harboured and expressed. 

91As I have noted, Mr Stoljar submitted that Mrs Grech's evidence obtained significant support from the email of 5 July 2004 sent by Mr Hasler to Mr Curtis, reporting on a conversation that Mr Hasler had had with Mr Davey. I deal with that email at [92] to [116] below. It is sufficient to say at this point that I do not regard the email as providing any corroboration sufficient to dispose me, contrary to what I have just said, to accept the aspects of Mrs Grech's evidence to which I have just referred. 

The email of 5 July 2004 

92On 5 July 2004, at about 9:09 pm, Mr Hasler sent an email to Mr Curtis. Omitting formal parts, that email reads as follows (I use, without further comment, Mr Hasler's distinctive mode of expression; and for convenience, I have added the paragraph numbers that appear below): 

Leon, 

(1) Here is the new pallet count with the container pallets in it. 

(2) I was talking to Phil on the way home tonight, he was confirming the trucks for tomorrow. 

(3) He asked me if we were taking up the option on the back part of the warehouse for all these pallets coming from UPS, I said no we are taking the two rooms next door. He then said how are you going to charge for that space, I said by the pallet of course, why? He said as long as we do not increase the bulk area, and just charge by the pallet know one will bat an eye lid, but if we start to double dip people (Brook) will start to ask questions. 

(4) So I said to him and how is Brook these days, he said she has been good and not worrying about us any more as the bills come in on time and nothing looks out of place, I said to him that's the way we want it. 

(5) So maybe we should not ingress the bulk hard stand, I got the feeling they may just wanting for us to want too much we will get more money for pallets anyway.

(6) My be just a pallet up rate will be the better way to go. $2.50 per pallet!

(7) What do you think!!

Craig..................


93In July 2004, Mr Hasler was still working full time for Optus, but was spending his evenings (or some of them) at Sumo's Campbelltown warehouse. 

94Adopting the paragraph numbering I have inserted, the third and fourth paragraphs seen to recount the conversation to which Mr Hasler referred in the second paragraph. The fifth and sixth paragraphs, I think, reflect Mr Hasler's views following that conversation. The seventh paragraph, clearly enough, seeks Mr Curtis' opinion on the matters that Mr Hasler raised for consideration in the fifth and sixth paragraphs. 

95According to Mrs Grech, the meeting at which, she says, she raised with Mr Davey the propriety of what Mr Curtis was doing is said to have occurred in January 2004. Thus, about six months would have elapsed between that supposed conversation (if, contrary to my view, it had occurred) and the email. Over that time, the volume of business done by MTM with Sumo had increased. 

96Perhaps not surprisingly, Mr Stoljar submitted that the email showed some consciousness on the part of Mr Hasler that: 

(1) there was something wrong in Sumo's doing business with Optus, through MTM as an intermediary or broker; and 

(2) that Mrs Grech had pointed this out back in January 2004 or thereafter. 

97Mr Rayment submitted that there was nothing sinister in the email, nor in the conversation to which it referred. 

98A series of emails tendered by the defendants shows that Mrs Grech had been dealing with a number of questions in relation to Sumo. Those questions included insurance and rates. Those emails passed between Mrs Grech for MTM and either Mr Curtis or his wife, Mrs Monica Curtis, for Sumo. Going back to what is noted at [90] above, Mrs Grech does not appear to manifest any disquiet whatsoever, in those emails, at having to deal with Mr or Mrs Curtis, or Sumo. 

99Mrs Grech also appears to have dealt with Sumo's invoices. For example, on 14 April 2004, Mrs Curtis sent to Mrs Grech Sumo's March invoice for Optus, in both PDF and excel formats (the latter ""to enable your rework for customer billing""). Mrs Grech replied: 

Hi Monica, 

Thanks for the invoice, I will let you know if we have any questions or further requirements with it. 

Regards 

Brooke 

100In another email, Mrs Curtis supplied Sumo's Australian Business Number and Tax File Number to Mrs Grech. 

101Quite apart from their relevance as noted at [90] above, those emails show, as one would expect, that Mrs Grech was involving herself in ensuring that Sumo, as a new supplier, did what was needed in the way that was needed; and that Sumo sought to accommodate her requirements. 

102Mr Rayment placed particular reliance on an exchange of emails between Mr Davey and Mrs Grech on 12 May 2004. 

103The first email came from Mr Davey. Leaving out formal parts, it stated: 

Please find attached revised sheets as discussed in relation to the Optus storage charging & costing for March / April 04 in relation to the exit of CALM. There are two sheets for March 04, the first being ""normal"" monthly sheet & the second being the March Reconciliation sheet.

The first ""normal"" sheet now reconcils [sic] with what we charged Optus on Inv 3066. ... 

The second March Reconciliation sheet takes up all the other storage charges & costs. ... 

104The last words that I have quoted were followed by some eight dot points. After those dot points, Mr Davey set out what he saw as the ""[b]ottom line"" as to how the charges should be allocated. 

105Mrs Grech replied about two hours later. She said:

Just quickly - what about SUMO charges for March you said we had not charged these yet and they were to be added into the additional March invoice that was for storage in advance. (other comments as per your point format)

106The ""other comments"" were comments that Mrs Grech had inserted against the various dot points in Mr Davey's email. 

107In short, it seems that what Mr Davey was seeking to do was reconcile the charges that had been levied by Sumo in the course of goods being transferred from CALM's warehouse to Sumo's warehouse. Mrs Grech appears to have been substantially satisfied as to the reconciliation; she noted that one of the matters referred to in one dot point ""was not costed""; and asked for further explanation in relation to another. 

108No doubt because of the way in which the evidence developed, Mrs Grech was not cross-examined as to the email exchange of 12 May 2004. Nor was Mr Davey, because the significance of that exchange does not appear to have occurred to the defendants until some time after Mr Davey had completed his evidence. 

109In short, Mr Rayment submitted that the email exchange of 12 May 2004 showed that Mrs Grech had been concerned to ensure that the charges rendered by MTM to Optus, to the extent that they covered the change over from CALM to Sumo, were properly reconciled. Mr Rayment submitted that it was this concern with Sumo's charges that underlay the conversation between Mr Davey and Mr Hasler recorded in Mr Hasler's email to Mr Curtis of 5 July 2004. 

110The reference to double-dipping does not seem to me to be sinister. One of the complaints that Optus had, concerning the services provided by CALM, related precisely to double-dipping. CALM set aside (or purported to set aside) space for the storage of Optus' stock, and charged Optus for that space on a ""per square metre"" basis. However, CALM also allowed other customers to store their goods within the space dedicated to (and paid for by) Optus, and charged those other customers accordingly. It was indeed double-dipping. 

111From the outset, it was made clear to Sumo that it would have to charge on a ""per pallet per week"" basis, and not on a ""per square metre"" basis, for the storage of Optus' stock. (This was varied, in the case of the cable drum storage and cable cutting equipment, but nothing turns on this.) I think it was the concern to avoid any suggestion of double-dipping that led Mr Davey to caution Mr Hasler that, if Sumo did take additional space on lease and did use it to store Optus' stock, Optus should be charged for the stock stored and not for the space taken. 

112Mr Stoljar submitted that ""[t]he conversation recorded in that email... has a surreptitious air, in the sense that the participants... seem implicitly to recognise that their conduct is underhand"" (written closing submissions, para 63). Mr Stoljar sought to support this proposition by reference to the manner in which Mr Hasler denied the conversation when it was put to him. At the point where he was asked whether he said ""and how is Brooke these days"", Mr Hasler responded negatively; indeed derisively, or in a laughing manner. I do not think that too much can be put on this. Mr Hasler did not impress me as a sophisticated man. I think he was expressing derision, or mirth, at the proposition that he would have been inquiring of Mr Davey after Mrs Grech's health. 

113I have no doubt that Mr Hasler (and Mr Curtis and, for that matter, Mr Davey) would want to keep Mrs Grech in a state where she was ""not worrying about us anymore"". That is because, if the billing arrangements satisfied Mrs Grech and the charges appeared to be proper, she would effectively approve them by passing them on to Optus with MTM's markup. Where the charges appear to be unjustified, or open to question, then, as the email exchange of 12 May 2004 shows, Mrs Grech would question them. This would mean more work for everyone. 

114Mr Stoljar submitted that this interpretation, for which Mr Rayment contended, was unlikely because the conversation took place about seven weeks after the email exchange. That overlooks both the subject of the email and its attachment. The former was ""[p]allet count"" and the second was an excel spreadsheet, ""Sumo pallet count June 04.xls"". 

115In short, Mr Hasler sent Mr Curtis the pallet count for June, so that Sumo's invoices to MTM for that month could be prepared. It is not unlikely, in those circumstances, that the discussion some seven weeks ago, involving reconciliation of the March accounts, was fresh to everyone's mind. 

116Thus, whilst I can understand why the email of 5 July 2004 excited some suspicion in the minds of Optus and its legal advisers, I do not think that it has the sinister significance placed upon it, and I do not regard it as corroborative of Mrs Grech's evidence as to the conversation that, she said, took place in January 2004. 

117I have no doubt that Mrs Grech would have queried anything and everything in Sumo's accounts for storage of Optus' stock, that looked irregular or out of place. I have no doubt that, in doing so, she would have caused a lot of work for everyone in reconciling and explaining. That is precisely what happened in May 2004. It is apparent from Mr Davey's email and its attachments that he had to do a lot of work to sort out the correct position and explain it to Mrs Grech's satisfaction. 

118It follows, in my view, that everyone would have wanted that Mrs Grech had no reason to ""worry"" about Sumo's invoices. And that, it seems to me, is really all the email says.

119In late 2003 or early 2004, Optus embarked on a project that became known as ""Project Harley"" (also known as OCT 881), seeking tenders for the provision of logistics services for the Optus group in Australia. It was apparently thought that, if the whole of the requirements of the Optus group could be put out to tender together (rather than as separate packages for the separate business units), significant savings might be effected. 

120Mr Curtis was a member of the Project Harley evaluation team, and in this capacity signed the undertakings to which I referred at [57] above. 

121Project Harley did not proceed. However, Mr Curtis accepted that the scope of the works to be put out for tender expressly excluded ""EOL and cable facility"", and that it was he who had caused to be done (T550.39-.49). The acronym ""EOL"" is used within Optus to refer to ""end of life"" stock - that is to say, obsolete or obsolescent stock. Optus had substantial quantities of EOL stock, and needed to store it somewhere, as cheaply as possible, until it could be disposed of. 

122The ""cable facility"" referred to is an internal Optus operation whereby cable required for various projects is stored in bulk on drums, and cut to length as needed for particular projects. 

123Ultimately, Sumo came to provide warehouse space to Optus both for the storage of EOL stock and for Optus' cable storage and cutting operations. 

Almad becomes a broker for Optus 

124In about February 2005, Mr Davey left MTM. As ever, his business connections left with him. However, Mr Davey did not move to another broker. Instead, he started his own broking business, through Almad. 

125After Mr Davey left MTM, the Optus business that had been transacted through that company was transacted through Almad. Mr Curtis appears to have ratified this for Optus: on the basis (he said) that ""Phil Davey provided the same broking service to Optus, under a different corporate name"" (affidavit sworn 5 March 2013, para 223). Mr Curtis said that he ""did not think of the business as moving to Almad, but rather staying with Phil Davey"" (para 224). Thus, Mr Curtis said, ""Almad began doing exactly what MTM had done for Optus"" (para 225). Mr Curtis ""did not observe any practical different in the services provided"" (para 226) and thus ""did not... consider that it was necessary to seek any alternative tender or approval to the change"" (para 227). 

126Shortly after Almad became an approved supplier, someone created a ""Waiver of Competition"" (in Optus parlance, ""WOC"") form for Almad. Once waiver of competition was approved, it meant that work done by Almad pursuant to the waiver did not need to be put out to competitive tender. The WOC was not general or unlimited, but said to be for the supply of about ""four thousand customised pallets at a cost of $8,000.00"". It appears to be uncontentious that this was the only WOC, and the only approval other than that referred to at [132] below, ever given to Almad over the ensuing years. It is not contentious that, over time, Almad handled (in round figures) $18 million of business from Optus. 

127Once Almad became an approved supplier, and once the WOC had been authorised, it issued a price list to Optus. That price list was effectively the price quoted by Sumo to MTM with the customary 20% markup. Mr Curtis (who had prepared the Sumo price list) approved Almad's price list on behalf of Optus (affidavit sworn 5 March 2013, para 236). 

128Thereafter, Almad began to invoice Optus for storage services provided by Sumo. The prices charged by Sumo (initially to MTM, before Mr Davey left MTM) had been prepared and authorised, on behalf of Sumo, by Mr Curtis. The same prices, quoted by MTM to Optus with MTM's broker markup of 20%, were approved by Mr Curtis on behalf of Optus. 

129Almad issued invoices to Optus from April 2005 until December 2010. It did so separately for various services: cable storage and cutting, EOL storage, and scrapping. The invoices were generally issued monthly, but sometimes fortnightly. The charges were calculated by taking the amount charged by Sumo to Almad and applying the 20% markup. 

130As a matter of practice, each time Optus received an invoice from Almad, an employee of Optus would create a purchase order (PO). The PO would quote the WOC number and repeat the amount of the Almad invoice. Another employee would then approve the PO, and in due course Optus would make payment to Almad. The POs were prepared by staff reporting to Mr Curtis, and were approved by other staff reporting to Mr Curtis. 

Mr Hasler leaves Optus 

131Mr Hasler stopped working for Optus on about 9 March 2005. Before he did so, he sent an email to colleagues at Optus, including Mr Harmanis and Mr Vito Abata, giving them his contact details at Sumo. Mr Hasler in fact started to work full time for Sumo in April 2005. 

132Shortly after Mr Hasler left Optus, Mr Harmanis completed a ""New Supplier Request Form"", for Almad to become a supplier to Optus in respect of ""customised pallets for shipment of satellite antenna's [sic]"". Mr Curtis authorised that request. In due course, it was approved. 

Corrupt payments 

133I note at this stage that, relatively late in the day, Optus raised as an issue of fact, to which it attributed great significance, payments which Mr Curtis caused Sumo to make to Mr Harmanis or his family. Initially, those payments took the form of wages. Later, they took the form of payments made to Mr Harmanis' wife Mrs Annette Harmanis. Those payments were made initially at the rate of $1,000.00 per month, increased relatively late in time to $2,800.00 per month. 

134Mr Curtis also caused Sumo to make payments to Mrs Dawne Zotz, who was the wife of another Optus employee, Mr Tom Zotz. 

135Further, Mr Curtis caused Electrosales to make some payments to Mr and Mrs Harmanis and to Mrs Zotz, and, it seems, to another member of the Zotz family. 

136In all, payments made to the Harmanis family exceeded $153,000.00, and payments made to the Zotz family totalled almost $104,000.00.

137Perhaps not surprisingly, Optus suggested that these were payments made corruptly, to induce Mr Harmanis and Mr Zotz to ensure that work was directed to Sumo, and that payment of Almad's invoices was approved. Mr Curtis denied this, and said that the payments were made as acts of generosity and benevolence, because the Harmanis and Zotz families faced significant financial problems. 

138I do not accept that evidence. I think that the payments were made corruptly, for the purposes that Optus identified. I note that none of the recipients was called to substantiate this aspect of Mr Curtis' evidence.

139There was a sharp dispute as to whether the evidence as to payments went any further than the question of credit, or whether it was relevant to the issues. I will return to that in dealing with issue 2. I do note, however, that Optus claims to be entitled to recover the amounts of those payments. 

The Mascot facility 

140Optus had a warehouse at St Peters. For some reason, this was invariably referred to as its ""Mascot"" warehouse, or ""facility"". I shall adopt that usage. Mr Jonathan Wilkie, who in 2005 was Optus' Director of Corporate Services, and to whom Mr Curtis reported, instructed Mr Curtis to find alternative sites for storage of equipment, apparently because the Mascot warehouse was running out of space. 

The G&D ""emergency""

141Up until April 2005, a company known as Giesecke and Devrient, generally called G&D, provided warehousing and other logistics services to Optus. As a result of a competitive tender, the contract was awarded to Toll Holdings. When this was announced, G&D said that once its contract with Optus expired, it would put all Optus equipment that it held ""on the street"". 

142Thus, Optus urgently needed to find space to store the equipment that would otherwise go on the street. Mr Curtis appears to have decided to store that equipment in Optus' Mascot facility, and to make room for it by moving the EOL and cable storage and cutting equipment from Mascot to Sumo's warehouse at Campbelltown. 

143Once the cable cutting operation was moved to Campbelltown, two Optus employees, Mr Alan Tee and Mr Joe Camilleri, started working there. Mr Tee is Mr Curtis' brother (Mr Curtis changed his family name, to that of his wife, when they married). Mr Camilleri is Mr Curtis' brother in law. 

Sumo increases its storage rate 

144By July 2005, Sumo was storing some Optus stock on the account of MTM and some on the account of Almad. A decision was apparently made to transfer the former from the account of MTM to the account of Almad. Obviously, this would be detrimental to MTM and beneficial to Almad, because MTM would lose, and Almad would gain, the 20% markup. 

145The transfer, in this accounting sense at least, started from July 2005. As stock was transferred, it was invoiced at a higher rate. At this stage, I should note that much of the stock was stored on pallets. Charges were generally levied on the basis of a charge per pallet per week, or per ""pallet equivalent"" per week. Sumo charged MTM $2.30 per pallet per week. MTM applied its 20% markup. The charge to Optus was expressed as $2.75 per pallet per week. Initially, the same rates were charged respectively by Sumo to Almad and by Almad to Optus.

146However, from July 2005, Sumo began to charge Almad for the storage of Optus stock at the rate of $3.00 per pallet per week. The charge rendered by Almad to Optus was $3.60 per pallet per week. 

Optus' stock is moved to Lidcombe

147The defendants say that the increase occurred as, and because, the stock was physically transferred from the Campbelltown warehouse to a new warehouse at Lidcombe. The defendants say that it had become clear to them that the lessor of the Campbelltown premises would require possession (according to Mr Curtis, the lease had always been seen as short term). Thus, there was, the defendants say, a perceived need for new accommodation. It was for that reason, the defendants say, that Sumo located alternative warehouse facilities at Lidcombe. 

148The defendants say that the increased storage charge was agreed between Sumo (Mr Curtis or Mr Hasler) and Almad (Mr Davey) and that it was justified because the rent for the Lidcombe premises was substantially higher, on a ""per square metre"" basis, than the rent for the Campbelltown premises. As a matter of fact, and leaving aside issues such as rent holiday and the like, this is plainly correct. 

149The defendants say that stock was moved from Campbelltown to Lidcombe progressively over the period July to December 2005. Optus says that the stock was not moved until about November or December, 2005. 

150The defendants rely on the evidence of Mr Curtis, Mr Davey, Mr Hasler, Mr Trent Hasler, and Mr Tull. Optus relies on various contemporaneous documents, including the invoices rendered by Almad to Optus. Those invoices noted that the goods in question were stored at the Campbelltown warehouse, even though the amount charged for storage was $3.60 per pallet per week. 

151The factual dispute is of crucial importance to Optus' case against Almad. The only element of the overcharging case pressed by Optus against Almad relates to the charges levied at the rate of $3.60 per pallet per week between July and December 2005, instead of what Optus contends was the correct price, $2.75 per pallet per week. In essence, there is a conflict between the evidence of the various witnesses on whom the defendants rely, and the evidence of contemporaneous documents and events (and inferences to be drawn from them) on which Optus relies. 

Optus' evidence, and submissions in respect of it

152I start with the matters on which Optus relied. 

153First, there are the invoices sent by Sumo to Almad for the months of July to December 2005. So far as the evidence goes, there are two invoices per month for July, August, September and December; but one only for October and November. Where there are two invoices, one appears to deal with the storage of pallets and related services, and the other with other services. However, each invoice describes the ""Storage Location"" as being the address of the Campbelltown warehouse. 

154The invoices dealing with the storage of pallets suggest that some 88 pallets came to be stored in the week ending 9 July, 280 the following week, 362 the week after and 568 for the week ending 30 July. A similar pattern (of increasing numbers) is observable in the invoices for pallet storage for succeeding months. 

155The invoices also show ""lift from transport"" and ""lift to transport"". As I understand it, those terms describe, respectively, the unloading of pallets delivered for storage and the loading of pallets to be transported elsewhere. At a level of some generality, the numbers of pallets said to be stored from week to week can be reconciled if attention is paid to the figures given for lifts from and to transport. 

156I said that the figures increase from week to week. However, it appears that the number of pallets stored stabilised, at a number said to be 5,651, by the beginning of December 2005. 

157Such of the Almad invoices to Optus as are available for the period July to December 2005 reflect (with the 20% markup) the amounts charged by Sumo to Almad. Almad's invoices to Optus do not indicate the location of storage, but the underlying Sumo invoices do. 

158Mr Stoljar submitted that the Sumo invoices, being business records created contemporaneously with the happening of the events to which they relate, should be treated as accurate. 

159Sumo had run into difficulties with the local council (Campbelltown City Council) in relation to the Campbelltown warehouse. The council asserted that use of the warehouse for storage of goods was not authorised under the existing development consent. (It will be recalled that the development consent was a matter that Mr Curtis had asked Mr Hasler to check with the council.) 

160On 5 October 2005, the council gave Sumo (more accurately, Mrs Curtis and Mrs Hasler, the lessees of the Campbelltown warehouse) notice that the council intended, subject to any representations that might be made, to order Sumo (or again, more accurately, Mrs Curtis and Mrs Hasler as lessees) to stop using the relevant parts of the warehouse premises ""for the storage, warehousing, repair and transport of goods"". 

161Sumo made representations to the council, which Mr Curtis accepted he had drafted. Those representations were dated (depending on where one looks) 16 September or 18 October 2005. They show that, before the representations were made, Mr Curtis had had a telephone conversation with an officer of the council. 

162The written representations noted, among other things, that Sumo was required to vacate the Campbelltown site in any event. It set out what were described as ""Sumo Plans"". Those plans were described as follows:

SUMO have actively engaged a search for alternative sites and have completed the following steps:-

1. Selected two sites and completed 3 proposals for premises in Chullora and Lidcombe. These are being considered by the Landlords at the moment. 

2. Informed all customers of pending changes and obtained permissions to move stock. 

3. Engaged a transport company for additional shuttle vehicles to minimise stock transfer time. 

The following steps and expected timeframes for the tasks remaining to enable a full move are

1. Agreeing lease terms with the prospective landlords 2-3 weeks 

2. Completion of a DA for one of the sites (DA in place for the Chullora Site) 8-12 weeks. 

3. Establish minimum security and OH&S requirements on new site 2 weeks in parallel with DA once confident of approval. 

4. Move stock;

(a) Secure additional forklifts to cover transition 

(b) Hire additional fork lift drivers to expedite movement 

(c) Move stock 3-4 weeks 

(d) Dismantle racking post move - 1 week 

All together with parallel running of activities where possible it will take on average 16 weeks to complete this move, meaning that the most likely best efforts move completion date will be Mid January. 


163The document set out various undertakings, and made further representations. It is not necessary to deal with them. 

164Mr Curtis was cross-examined on this document. He accepted that it could be read as saying that no alternative warehouse premises had been located, and that no goods had been moved from Campbelltown to the new premises, at the time the representations were made. However, Mr Curtis maintained that: the Lidcombe premises had been located; Sumo (in the person of Mr Hasler) had been given the key; those premises had been readied; and pallets were being transported to them. He accepted that, in those circumstances, his letter to council was misleading. He appeared to rely on the doctrine of necessity to justify that conduct. 

165In the ordinary way, I would be slow to conclude that a document prepared by a person for an official purpose was misleading, and intentionally so. However, I regret to say that I think that it entirely in character for Mr Curtis, as I have been able to assess him, to act in a deceptive and dishonest way, in his dealings with the council, if he thought it were to his or to Sumo's advantage to do so. To put it another way: on my assessment of Mr Curtis' standards of honesty, business morality and respect for the truth, I do not find it surprising that he would have drafted an intentionally misleading document for submission to the council, in an attempt to gain time for Sumo to move (or complete moving) pallets stored at Campbelltown. 

166On 22 October 2005, there was what was described as a meeting of the members of Sumo, held at Mr Curtis' house. Mr and Mrs Curtis were there, as were Mr and Mrs Hasler. Item 4 of the business transacted at that meeting is recorded as follows:

4. It has been agreed to relocate warehouse as soon as possible. We agreed that we can maintain a rental of up to $85 per square metre. We will require temporary labour before and during the move, which is expected to take one month and be complete be [sic] the end of February 2006. Trent had suggested his friend Kieran Hall as a suitable temporary employee and Craig was to offer him $20 per hour gross. 

167Mr Stoljar submitted, in reliance on what was stated in Australian Securities and Investments Commissions v Hellicar (2012) 86 ALJR 522 at [7], [72], that the minutes were evidence of the truth of the matters recorded in them. He noted that Mrs Curtis, the author of the minutes, had not been called, and submitted that the court could infer that her evidence would not have assisted the defendants. The same submission was put in respect of Mrs Hasler, who was present at the meeting but was not called. 

168I accept, as the Court said in Hellicar at [7], that the minutes of meetings of a company's board should be regarded as ""a formal record... of what had happened at the meeting"". Their Honours were of course talking of adopted minutes. It is not clear (although see at [176] below) that the minutes of the meeting held on 22 October 2005 had been adopted. Nonetheless, I think, the inference should be drawn that Mrs Curtis sought to record accurately in the draft minutes (as certainly they may be regarded) the business that had been transacted at the meeting. 

169Accepting, particularly in the absence of Mrs Curtis and Mrs Hasler, that the minutes should be regarded as substantially accurate, nonetheless, they leave open the question of what is involved in the relocation of the warehouse. The ""warehouse"" comprised not only the storage space within which stored goods were located, and within which the cable cutting operations were conducted. It comprised also the administrative centre, or office, from which the day to day activities of Sumo's business were run. 

170Of course, the minute notes also that Sumo would require additional labour ""before and during the move, which is expected to take one month"". If the Sumo invoices are to be taken as records of the removal of pallets from Campbelltown to Lidcombe (as Mr Rayment submitted they are), then, by 22 October, almost 4200 pallets had been so moved: that is to say, about three-quarters of the total that had come to reside in the Lidcombe warehouse by December 2005. One would expect the need for ""temporary labour"" to have manifested itself somewhat earlier in the process. 

171I have not overlooked that what was to be moved included not only the pallets and the office or administrative resources at Campbelltown, but also the cable drums and cable cutting equipment. The cable cutting equipment was apparently of a highly specialised nature, and it was necessary for an expert contractor to take it apart, pack it up, supervise the move to Lidcombe and reassemble it at Lidcombe. That was all done over a weekend, at the end of the move, so as not to disrupt those of Optus' activities that required cable to be cut to length. 

172I do not think that the need for ""temporary labour"" arose because of the moving of the cable drums and cable cutting equipment: at least in the case of the latter, that was attended to by outside contractors. 

173The signed lease for the Lidcombe premises commenced on 1 December 2005. It does not appear when the lease was actually signed. It was however stamped on 12 January 2006. The consent of the National Australia Bank, as mortgagee, to the registration of the lease was given on 24 February 2006. 

174The lease contained provision for, among other things, a ""rent holiday"": no rent was payable until 1 January 2006. 

175I note, in passing, that Mr Rayment submitted that Sumo as lessee was required to pay not only rent but also a proportion of outgoings. That does not appear to be correct. Clause 18.01 of the lease required the lessee to pay ""the Lessee's proportion of any Outgoings..."". Clause 18.02 stated that the ""Lessee's proportion"" was as stated in item 7 of the Schedule. Item 7 of the Schedule states ""0%"". 

176It was necessary for Sumo to provide a bank guarantee in respect of its obligations under the lease (see Part 16 of the lease). The amount required was 3 months' rent plus GST (see item 6 of the Schedule): about $175,000.00. A minute of a meeting of the members of Sumo held at the Curtis home on 12 November 2005 records a resolution to open a term deposit with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ - Sumo's and Electrosale's banker) ""for the full amount required as a bank guarantee for the rental bond"" for the Lidcombe premises. I note that, if that were the meeting next after the meeting of 22 October 2005, then one of the items of business at the latter meeting was recorded as a resolution to confirm the minutes of the former meeting. 

177The very strong impression created by these aspects of the evidence is that it was not until late October 2005 that Sumo turned its attention to the move, and that the steps necessary to effect the move were put in place shortly thereafter. It could be inferred that the activity which commenced in late October 2005 was prompted by the threat from the council to issue an order preventing use of the Campbelltown premises as a warehouse. However, regardless of the attitude of the council, it was necessary to move, because the property had been sold and it was apparently understood that the new owner would require vacant possession relatively soon after completion (which occurred in August 2005). 

178If the Sumo invoices to Almad do record, as they suggest, the number of pallets stored at the Campbelltown premises, then they are very hard to reconcile with the submissions that Mr Stoljar put in respect of the documentary evidence. That is because, taken at face value, the Sumo invoices indicate (as I have said) that by the end of November 2005 (to be accurate, by the week ending 25 November 2005), 5651 pallets were stored at Campbelltown. They indicate, further, that the same number remained stored at Campbelltown throughout December 2005. But that cannot be correct. On any view, even that for which Optus contended, the pallets (if not at all, then at least the very great part of them) had been moved from Campbelltown to Lidcombe by the end of December 2005. 

179At one point, I think, it was submitted for Optus that the Sumo invoices for the period July to December 2005 reflected not the physical movement of pallets from one location to another but, rather, a change in the identity of the broker on whose account the pallets were held. But again, if that is correct, it does not explain why 5651 pallets were said to have been held for the last week of November and the whole of December at the Campbelltown warehouse, when on any view, by then, they must have been moved to Lidcombe. 

180When one analyses the Sumo invoices, in the light of such other documentary evidence as there is, and bearing in mind the objective fact that the pallets were housed in Lidcombe by the end of December 2005, the invoices cannot be regarded as accurate in every detail of what is stated. Once that is acknowledged, then the probative force of their recording of the pallets as stored at Campbelltown diminishes. 

181Another matter on which Mr Stoljar relied was that insurance for the Lidcombe warehouse was not effected until 6 December 2005. On that date, an insurance company issued a certificate of currency in relation to the Lidcombe warehouse, stating a period of insurance commencing on 1 December 2005. 

182Mr Stoljar submitted, understandably, that it was inconceivable that Sumo, being on risk for the pallets as a bailee for reward (there were not proved any terms of bailment which limited its liability in that regard), would have left the goods uninsured in the Lidcombe warehouse. One answer to that submission is, I think, that it was Mr Hasler who was responsible for the move; and without being unkind to Mr Hasler, I do not think it entirely surprising that he might have overlooked the matter of insurance. Mr Hasler said (T401.49 - 402.17) that Mr Curtis ""was a bit upset with me, that I actually moved them"". I have little doubt that Mr Curtis would have been upset had he found out that the pallets were sitting, uninsured and entirely at Sumo's risk, in the Lidcombe warehouse. 

The defendants' evidence, and submissions in respect of it

183I turn to the evidence on which the defendants relied. 

184Mr Hasler dealt with the move in his affidavit sworn 31 July 2013. He noted that, after the term of the lease for Campbelltown ended (in March 2005) and Sumo became a monthly tenant, there were negotiations with ""Sam and Dan"" relating to the Lidcombe premises. According to Mr Hasler (para 6) the following happened: 

6. The negotiations in relation to the lease of the Lidcombe premises were conducted by Leon Curtis. I recollect going to a meeting at the offices of the new landlord, being for the Lidcombe premises, with Leon Curtis and the landlord's representatives who I knew as Sam and Dan in about July 2005 just prior to picking up the keys to the Lidcombe premises. It was soon after this meeting that I was able to get the keys and go to the Lidcombe premises to start cleaning it up. I also at this stage started to move pallets from the Campbelltown premises to the Lidcombe premises. 

185Mr Hasler said that, after June 2005, he spent most of his time at Lidcombe cleaning and preparing the premises. He did however go to Campbelltown to assist Mr Trent Hasler in preparing goods to be transported. Mr Hasler said that the process of transporting pallets took some four to five months, ""initially in small numbers and thereafter in larger numbers"" (para 9). I note that, if the Sumo invoices do refer to pallets moved from Campbelltown to Lidcombe and stored at Lidcombe, then this would appear to be correct. 

186Mr Hasler said that he did not complete ""run sheets"" for pallets that were moved from Campbelltown to Lidcombe, because he regarded it as a matter internal to Sumo. He did however say that he made notes of pallet movements on sheets of paper: he thought ""[i]t might have been on the back of the run sheets"" (para 7). In fact, run sheets were produced which, when examined, did have figures on the back of them that Mr Hasler identified as being notes made by him of pallets moved from Campbelltown to Lidcombe. 

187Run sheets are Sumo records prepared to enable pallet movements in and out of a warehouse, on various accounts, to be recorded. They are known formally as ""pallet count sheets"". They provide for the recording of movements of pallets on account of Optus and on account of other companies for whom Sumo stored pallets. Run sheets have been produced for the months of August, September, October and November 2005. There are numbers recorded on the back of some of those run sheets (usually, there was more than one run sheet completed for each month). The only explanation for those numbers is that given by Mr Hasler; nothing emerged in the course of cross-examination to suggest that the numbers might refer to something else altogether. 

188Mr Davey dealt with the topic in his affidavit sworn 30 January 2013, at para 90. I set out that paragraph (except the last sentence, which was not read):

90. I do not understand the allegation that moving costs were charged for moving equipment (said to be pallets and unspecified other equipment). I do not understand exactly what is being referred to, or what dates or invoices the overcharging is alleged to have taken place on. All equipment moved, whether pallets or otherwise. I cannot understand how Optus could not know this. This move took place over a period of about 5-6 months, from about July to December 2005. I oversaw this equipment being move. I saw the equipment removed from one location and replaced in another location, as requested by Leon Curtis, Alex Harmanis and Allen Tee from Optus. 


189Mr Davey said further, at para 91, that ""[t]he move of EOL stock and pallets took place over these months, and I saw it happen"".

190Mr Trent Hasler worked as a storeman at the Campbelltown warehouse during 2005. He said his duties included ""arranging... the safe loading of pallets located at the Campbelltown warehouse for transfer to the new Lidcombe warehouse"" (affidavit sworn 30 July 2013, para 6). This was done, he said, under his father's supervision (para 7). 

191Mr Trent Hasler said (para 12):

Whilst I have no clear recollection of the date when pallets were being transferred, it is to the best of my knowledge and recollection that it took place over a period of three to four months ending in December 2005. The end date was certainly a few weeks before Christmas 2005. 

192Mr Tull is (and in 2005 was) a haulage contractor with his own truck. He said, in his affidavit sworn 7 August 2013, that he had had occasion to go to the Campbelltown warehouse to pick up goods for another customer. While he was there, he had a conversation with Mr Hasler, in the course of which Mr Hasler inquired whether Mr Tull could assist with moving pallets ""from July for as long as it takes"". 

193Thereafter, Mr Tull said (paras 5 to 9): 

5. I recollect that I commenced moving pallets in various configurations as to width, height and weight at the latest, I believe, in the 2nd week of July 2005 and continued to provide the transport services until just prior to Christmas 2005. I transported the pallets from Campbelltown to a warehouse in Nyrang Street at Lidcombe, next to the brewery. I can say that the move commenced in July as I recollect that it was very cold. I also had trouble opening the curtain on my tautliner trailer as they would freeze up in the morning. 

6. At the time I was invoicing for my business and I invoiced EPM for the cost of transport. All of my invoices were paid. 

7. Because of a number of house moves that I have had since 2005 all of the invoicing and banking records have been destroyed. 

8. Most of the time during the period July to December 2005, I was doing daily trips 5 days per week with an occasional weekend. 

9. My truck is able to transport 22 pallets. However, the number of pallets would vary on trips because of size, both width and height and also the weight involved. 

194Mr Curtis, too, dealt with the topic of the move, in an affidavit sworn 31 July 2013. Mr Curtis said that it was his practice to make regular visits to the Campbelltown warehouse on at least one day every weekend. He said that, during one of those weekend visits, he became aware that pallets had been moved (para 11): 

11. I became aware on one of my weekend visits in early August 2005 that Craig Hasler had commenced to move pallets into the Lidcombe premises. The conversation with him in which I said: ""you've got to be joking. We've got no lease and no security. What if the whole thing falls through?"" He said: ""we don't have any other choice"". I said: ""why"". He said: ""we are doing the 3G, lots of stock coming in and we've got no space left."" 

195Those remarks may have caused Mr Hasler to think, as he said (see at [182] above) that ""Leon was a bit upset with me"". I should add at this point that, notwithstanding the reservations I have expressed about Mr Hasler's evidence, I do not think it at all plausible that he would have become aware of this paragraph of Mr Curtis' affidavit, and therefore seized on an opportunity, in the course of cross-examination, to put his own spin on it. Any suggestion of that nature (and no such suggestion was put to Mr Hasler) would impute a degree of sophistication that, I must say, I think Mr Hasler entirely lacks. 

196There is thus a substantial body of testimonial evidence which, if accepted, would support the proposition that the pallets were moved incrementally from about July until December 2005. There is some contemporaneous documentation (the numbers recorded on the reverse of some of the run sheets from August to November 2005) which could be regarded as providing corroboration for that testimonial evidence. Further, the process thus described is consistent with an interpretation of the Sumo invoices which holds that they do (despite the statement of the storage location) record the ever increasing numbers of pallets being stored, from month to month, at Lidcombe. 

197As one might expect, the witnesses were cross-examined closely and at some length (particularly, in the case of Mr Hasler) on their recollections as to the move. It is fair to say that, when pressed, no witness could be precise as to the exact month when particular events happened. In Mr Hasler's case of course, if one were to accept that the numbers recorded on the reverse of some of the run sheets do record transfers from Campbelltown to Lidcombe, then the significance of that uncertainty in the witness box is much diminished. 

198It is not surprising that Mr Trent Hasler and Mr Tull do not have a precise memory of exactly when pallets were moved, and in what quantities. In Mr Tull's case, the loss of his business records for that period leaves him without any independent contemporaneous evidence from which his memory might be refreshed. But the striking feature of the evidence is that, although Mr Trent Hasler and Mr Tull in particular could not swear to precise months, each was insistent, and unshaken, that the move took place over a number of months. 

199I regard the evidence of Mr Tull as being of particular significance. He is completely independent. He impressed me as someone who sought to give honest and accurate evidence. And there is a particular matter that he recollects: that the covering, or ""curtains"", of his truck (which he called a ""tautliner"") were frozen when he arrived at the Campbelltown warehouse early in the morning. 

200In 2005, Mr Tull lived at Ingleburn, which is not far from Campbelltown and, on his evidence, enjoys a similar climate. Mr Tull said that the material that comprises the curtains of his tautliner absorbs moisture and that, when the temperature drops down towards freezing, the moisture freezes and makes the curtains very hard to manipulate. That is a striking and credible aspect of Mr Tull's evidence. It adds substantial probative force to his evidence that, give or take a month, he started to move pallets from Campbelltown to Lidcombe in about July or August 2005. It was not put to him that the phenomenon was consistent with the work's having been done in November and December 2005. 

201Mr Stoljar appeared to accept that, if accepted, this aspect of Mr Tull's evidence would mean that it was likely that the move had started in mid year. He submitted, correctly, that Mr Tull was uncertain as to dates. But no one suggested that the move occurred in any year other than 2005. And Mr Stoljar did not suggest that Mr Tull's evidence, of helping with the move, was completely false. 

202It is apparent from Mr Tull's evidence that he had been to the Campbelltown premises from time to time for other purposes. It is thus, I suppose, possible that his recollection as to the frozen curtains might be a mistaken transposition from one other (earlier or later) occasion to the occasion of the move. 

203Nonetheless, considering the whole of Mr Tull's evidence, and taking into account (to the extent that it is a reliable guide) his demeanour and the manner in which his evidence was given, I conclude that it should be accepted, and thus that it provides powerful support for the defendants' proposition that the move of pallets, from Campbelltown to Lidcombe, did commence in about mid 2005. 

204I also regard Mr Trent Hasler's evidence as having significant probative force. I accept that he is not as remote from the proceedings, nor as independent, as Mr Tull. Nonetheless, Mr Trent Hasler impressed me as an honest witness who sought to give reliable evidence. I do not think that Mr Trent Hasler is someone who would tell untruths for the sake of his father (or for that matter, for the sake of anyone else). Thus, although Mr Trent Hasler accepted that his memory of precise months was unreliable, nonetheless I find the thrust of his evidence - that the move took place over a number of months, and not just at the end of 2005 - is persuasive. 

205Mr Davey, of course, does have a significant interest in this matter. If the move did happen over a period of time, and if the Sumo invoices do show (contrary to their description) charges for pallets stored at Lidcombe, then the remaining part of the overcharge case brought against Almad falls to the ground. But that does not mean that Mr Davey's evidence can be disregarded entirely. 

206Mr Stoljar submitted that there were difficulties with this aspect of Mr Davey's evidence: in particular, with his evidence that the move occurred ""as requested by Leon Curtis, Alex Harmanis and Allen Tee from Optus"" (see the paragraph quoted at [188] above). 

207Mr Stoljar submitted, correctly, that the move from Campbelltown to Lidcombe was undertaken by Sumo for its own purposes, and was not something that Optus had requested. The criticism may be accepted. But it does not seem to me to follow that this aspect of Mr Davey's evidence should be rejected. 

208Mr Stoljar pointed to what he said were absurdities in the defendants' case. Prime among those was the proposition that a prospective landlord would act as Mr Hasler (and others) said had happened: namely, give Sumo the key to the premises, and permit it to move pallets in, before any lease had been signed, before any deposit or bond had been paid and before (so far as the landlord knew) any insurance had been effected. There is great force in that submission. But it does not appear that the proprietor of the Lidcombe premises was acting through an agent, who might have counselled caution. 

209Mr Hasler's evidence is that he and Mr Curtis met with the two individuals who stood behind the landlord, satisfied themselves that the premises were acceptable, and were given the key for the purpose of moving in, well before any lease was signed. While that is clearly unbusinesslike and risky (from the landlord's perspective), it cannot be regarded as so glaringly improbable as to require rejection of this aspect of the evidence. Nor can it be regarded as so glaringly improbable as to require rejection of (for example) Mr Tull's evidence. 

210I accept also, as Mr Stoljar submitted, that the contemporaneous documents, on a fair reading (indeed, on their most plausible reading), are consistent with the move's having occurred (or at least commenced) substantially later than mid 2005. That, too, is a consideration that needs to be balanced with all the available evidence and the inferences from it. Those inferences include, of course, the inference properly available from the unexplained failure to call Mrs Curtis and Mrs Hasler, in relation to the meeting of 22 October 2005. 

211The gradual increase in the number of pallets stored from July to November 2005, and the apparent stabilisation of that number in December 2005, seem to me to be consistent with the proposition that pallets were being shipped into the Lidcombe warehouse for what was in effect long term storage. That would be consistent with the delivery and storage of EOL material, which was not likely to cycle quickly through the warehouse. One of the witnesses (I think, but it does not matter, Mr Davey) described the pallets of EOL stock as ""static"": a term used in the warehousing industry to indicate goods that are stored for relatively lengthy periods of time, and that do not require constant handling. 

212It is Optus that asserts an overcharge. It is thus Optus that bears the burden of proving, on the balance of probabilities, that there was an overcharge. Certainly, if matters went no further then the documentary evidence on which Optus relies, the conclusion for which Optus contends would be well and truly available. But there are countervailing considerations:

(1) what I regard as the honest and substantially (if not in every precise detail) correct evidence given by Mr Tull and by Mr Trent Hasler; 

(2) the evidence given by Mr Davey; 

(3) the correlation between the numbers of pallets shown on the Sumo invoices and the proposition that pallets were delivered incrementally, month by month, from Campbelltown to Lidcombe; and 

(4) the numbers recorded on the reverse of some of the run sheets between August and November 2005. 

213Further, I regard this aspect of Mr Hasler's evidence as important. Notwithstanding my general reservations as to his credibility, I think that his evidence on a matter directly within his control, of the kind under consideration, is likely to be reliable. I do not think that Mr Hasler is a person who could sustain a falsehood; without wishing to be unkind, I simply do not think that he has the degree of intellectual sophistication that such an exercise would require. Thus, I regard Mr Hasler's evidence as of some value; and I do consider that it is corroborated, in its essential respects, by the handwritten figures on the reverse of the run sheets, to which I have referred. 

214I do not take Mr Curtis' evidence into account, notwithstanding what could be seen as corroboration of a part of it by Mr Hasler in cross-examination. 

215Taking all the available evidence into account, I conclude that Optus has not discharged the onus of proving the overcharge relating to pallet numbers. Further, and placing particular weight (as I do) on the evidence of Mr Tull and Mr Trent Hasler, I conclude that it is more likely than not that pallets were moved from Campbelltown to Lidcombe incrementally, from about July 2005 up until November or December 2005. 

The 3G Reconciliation Project 

216I return to the chronological narration. In about August 2005, Optus undertook what was called the ""3G Reconciliation Project"". There was a concern that a large amount of equipment supplied by Nokia to Optus, for the purpose of establishing the 3G telecommunications network, had been lost. It was decided to bring the equipment (or what there was of it) back from the various places where it was located so that a thorough count and reconciliation could be undertaken. 

217Mr Curtis ""negotiated"" with Mr Davey for the provision of storage space at Sumo's Campbelltown warehouse, a rate of $3.00 per square metre. That negotiation was undertaken by Mr Curtis on behalf of Sumo. The storage space for 3G stock, required during the reconciliation project, was thereafter provided by the Campbelltown warehouse. 

Storage of EOL stock 

218At about the same time, Mr Curtis discussed with his superior Mr Wilkie the proposition that Optus might take a lease of a warehouse in its own name where it could store EOL stock. That was apparently necessary because the rates charged by UPS were regarded as ""unrealistic"". 

219Mr Wilkie instructed a Mr Tony Hunter, of Optus' Corporate Property Team, to be involved in the lease negotiations. 

220According to Mr Wilkie (whose evidence I accept), Mr Curtis said that he had found a warehouse at Botany which would be cheaper than paying for external storage. However, early in 2006, Mr Curtis instructed Mr Hunter to stop investigating that lease proposal. Mr Curtis said that this was done for lack of capital. But the proposal was to lease the warehouse, not to buy it. Mr Curtis said that the lack of capital meant that the warehouse could not be fitted out. Mr Wilkie's evidence suggests that the relatively limited capital required to fit out a leased warehouse would not have been a problem. I prefer Mr Wilkie's evidence. 

221Mr Stoljar submitted, in my view correctly, that Mr Curtis had sought to manipulate events to ensure that the benefit of EOL storage went to (or remained with) Sumo. 

The Braintree and Telecycling sales

222In October 2007, Mr Curtis caused Electrosales to sell to a company known as Braintree Communications Pty Ltd stock of Optus valued at $15,000.00. That conversion has been admitted. 

223In about April 2008, Mr Curtis caused Electrosales to sell to Telecycling the ""Megatron"" stock. 

Mr Curtis leaves Optus 

224Mr Curtis ceased working for Optus in December 2008. 

225Mr Curtis was succeeded by a Mr King, who in turn was succeeded by Mr Robert Natale. Under Mr Natale's instructions, audits were carried out of stock said to have been warehoused by Sumo. 

226On 20 December 2010, Optus notified Mr Davey that it no longer wished to use Almad's services. 

227I shall return to these events (including the result of the audits carried out under Mr Natale's instructions) in discussing the claim against Sumo for conversion, and Almad's cross-claim against Optus for unpaid storage charges. 

Other quotations for storage 

228Mr Stoljar placed reliance on quotations for storage given by Sumo to customers other than Almad. One such quotation was given to Bunnings in March 2007. It quoted a rate of $2.70 per pallet per week for the first 1000 pallets, and $2.50 per pallet per week thereafter. That is lower than the charge of $3.00 per week (later increased to $3.60 per week) charged by Sumo to Almad for the storage of Optus' stock. 

229Mr Curtis sought to justify this on a number of bases. One was that the rate charged for Optus pallets included such internal handling as was necessary, whereas for other customers (such as Bunnings) there were additional handling charges imposed. 

230Further, there was some evidence (including, I think, from Mr Davey) to the effect that one might charge a lesser rate per pallet per week to fill completely a warehouse that was partly full than one would charge otherwise. 

231Looking at the range of quotations or rate charts that are in evidence, it does seem to me that there is sufficient variability in the range of services priced to make it difficult to conclude, simply from a variation in the pallet rate, that the rates charged to Optus were excessive. Nonetheless, I think, Mr Curtis regarded Optus as an established, or ""locked in"" customer, and did not trouble to extend to it the benefit of competitive prices that he was prepared to offer to win the business of other customers. 

232I now turn to the issues. 

First issue: the case against Mr Curtis

233Optus alleges breach of the contractual, fiduciary and statutory duties owed by Mr Curtis. As I have said already, the contract of employment was one made between Optus Administration and Mr Curtis. It is clear that Mr Curtis owed the duties alleged (including under ss 182 and 183 of the Corporations Act) to Optus Administration. It is equally clear that he breached them. 

234It is not at all unusual, in the commercial world, for employees of a particular company to perform services not only for that company but also for its related bodies corporate. It is common, where a group of companies carries on business, for one company to be the employer, and for the persons employed by it to provide their services to the operating companies in the group. 

235That is exactly what happened in this case. The operating companies appear to have been the first plaintiff and the second plaintiff (Singtel Optus and Singtel Networks). 

236All plaintiffs claim the benefit of Mr Curtis' duties. It is not entirely clear whether, as the case was run, Mr Curtis disputed this, so far as the contractual and fiduciary duties are concerned. That lack of clarity flows from the failure of the defendants' submissions to address specifically the agreed statement of issues. 

237Going to Mr Curtis' response to the FACLS: the allegation of contractual duties set out in para 10A of the FACLS is admitted. Thus, Mr Curtis admits (as does Electrosales) that, among other things, he was required:

(1) to act in the best interests of Optus Administration and its related bodies corporate; 

(2) not to compete with those bodies;

(3) not to disclose confidential information of those bodies; and

(4) not to use confidential information to cause injury to those bodies. 

238 Mr Curtis' alleged fiduciary obligations are pleaded in FACLS para 11. Those obligations are in substance admitted so far as they concern Optus Administration, but not so far as they concern ""the Optus Group"". 

239I observe, as a matter of curiosity rather than significance, that the fiduciary obligations pleaded include obligations of a prescriptive nature (alleging that Mr Curtis was required to do certain things, or to act in a certain way). That is not consistent with the general nature of fiduciary obligations, which is that they are proscriptive in nature. 

240In principle, it seems to me to be correct to analyse the contractual relationship between Optus (that is to say, the three plaintiffs) and Mr Curtis in the following way:

(1) the contract of employment was made between Optus Administration as employer and Mr Curtis as employee; 

(2) the contract included promises made by Mr Curtis for the benefit not just of Optus Administration but also of the other plaintiffs; 

(3) objectively, Optus Administration and Mr Curtis intended that Optus Administration was to hold the benefit of the contract of employment (that is to say, the benefit of Mr Curtis' promises in the contract of employment) not just on its own behalf but also for the other plaintiffs;

(4) in those circumstances, Optus Administration is a trustee of the benefit of the promises for the other plaintiffs; and 

(5) accordingly, to the extent that Optus Administration itself has suffered damage, it is entitled to enforce the contracts, but it is also entitled to enforce the contracts for the benefit of the other plaintiffs, to the extent that they have suffered damage. 

241This analysis (which Mr Stoljar had propounded) was not challenged in the submissions for Mr Curtis. 

242As has been noted, the contract of employment required that Mr Curtis should act in the best interests, not just of Optus Administration, but also of the other plaintiffs; and should not act in conflict with the interests of those companies. 

243In circumstances where, in effect, Mr Curtis undertook to serve not just Optus Administration but also the other plaintiffs, and where he undertook obligations to act in the best interests of all plaintiffs, it does not seem to me to be at all inconsistent with either principle or commercial practice to conclude that the fiduciary obligations arising from the contract of employment were owed to all three plaintiffs. 

244I am comforted in taking that approach by the way in which the written closing submissions for Mr Curtis (and Electrosales) proceeded. They make it clear that the existence of the duties is not in question; nor is the proposition that they are owed not just to Optus Administration but to the plaintiffs generally. Thus, para 2 states (so far as it is relevant):

Mr Curtis' evidence is replete with admissions of those parts of the conduct complained of in this case, which involve a conflict of interest. He did not suggest that he obtain [sic] fully informed consent to his involvement in Sumo. 

245 Then, in para 3, the submissions continue:

The cases are replete with examples of fiduciaries in a conflict of interest situation who have injured the person to whom such fiduciary obligations are owed. Usually, in the case of a large commercial enterprise, competition will lie at the foundation of the action. ... [a]bsent from this case is any suggestion of acts done in competition with Optus. 

246As the submissions proceed (and the way in which they were developed orally was not materially different) it is crystal clear that their essential point is that although the fiduciary duties were owed to the plaintiffs generally, the plaintiffs suffered no loss by reason of the admitted facts which show breach of those duties. That is clear from paras 6 and 7 of the written outline, where it is said: 

What the plaintiffs apparently find unpalatable... is the conflict of interest alleged against Mr Curtis. They have elected to claim equitable damages for the breach of the fiduciary duty.

...

Thus ... the claim for relief against Mr Curtis comes down to the question whether the markup paid to Almad Pty Limited was a loss suffered by the plaintiffs (my emphasis). 

247Different questions arise in respect of the breaches alleged of the duties imposed by ss 182 and 183 of the Corporations Act. Mr Rayment submitted that those duties could be owed only to Optus Administration, as the employer; that Optus Administration had no entitlement to receive compensation for loss suffered by the other plaintiffs; and that s 1317H, properly understood, confirmed this. 

248It is clear, and Mr Stoljar readily accepted, that Optus, however its case is framed, can recover only the one measure of compensation. It is equally clear that the claim (however framed) is for the same asserted loss. Thus, it is not necessary to resolve the disputes concerning the application of ss 182 and 183 and the claim for compensation under s 1317H. And for the same reason, it is not necessary to resolve the dispute as to who are the beneficiaries of Mr Curtis' contractual duties. 

249The extant claims are for equitable compensation in respect of Almad's markup and the alleged overcharge. For the reasons that I have given, I conclude that Optus has failed to prove the latter aspect of its case. But in any event, if Optus recovers equitable compensation, that will exhaust its remedies. It would not recover more, or on any different basis, under s 1317H. Nor would it recover more for breach of contract. 

250I turn to the remaining aspect of the claim against Mr Curtis. As I have noted, that is a claim for equitable compensation to recover the markup paid to Almad. 

251Mr Stoljar submitted:

(1) the question was what would have happened ""but for"" the breaches of fiduciary duty; and 

(2) the answer is that Optus would have leased a warehouse itself for the storage of EOL stock and the cable cutting operations, would not have needed the Sumo warehouse, and thus would not have needed to pay Almad's markup on Sumo's charges. 

252Mr Rayment's submissions did not address in detail what might be called the ""counter-factual"": what would have happened if, hypothetically, Mr Curtis had made full disclosure, to his superiors, of his involvement; and had not terminated (as Optus submitted he did) the search for a warehouse for Optus to lease. Instead, Mr Rayment's submissions focused on the course of business that had developed between the various brokers and Optus; Mr Davey's integral role in that course of business; and the continuous nature of the services provided by Mr Davey through Almad. 

253In Re Dawson (deceased) [1966] 2 NSWR 211, Street J considered the question of causation, in relation to a claim for compensation for breach of trust. His Honour referred to the authorities and said at 215 that one of them:

... is consistent with the proposition that if a breach has been committed then the trustee is liable to place the trust estate in the same position as it would have been in if no breach had been committed. Considerations of causation, foreseeability and remoteness do not readily enter into the matter. 

254His Honour reviewed further authorities, which he saw as being consistent with that approach. He then stated (again at 215):

The principles embodied in this approach do not appear to involve any inquiry as to whether the loss was caused by or flowed from the breach. Rather the inquiry in each case would appear to be whether the loss would have happened if there had been no such breach. 

255Tadgell J considered the question in Hill v Rose [1990] VR 129 at 143 - 144. His Honour observed that the purpose of equitable compensation was ""evidently... to place the party who suffers following the breach of duty as nearly as possible in the position in which he would have stood had there been no breach."" However, his Honour said, equity's approach differed from that of the common law on the question of causation. His Honour said at 144 that the obligation imposed on trustees and other fiduciaries to make restitution to the beneficiary or the trust estate ""is not limited or influenced by common law principles governing remoteness of damage, foreseeability or causation"". His Honour stated, with evident approval, the approach that Street J had articulated in re Dawson at 215. 

256It is instructive to look at the way in which Tadgell J applied that approach (again at 144). His Honour said that, had the plaintiff been told of the matters that should have been disclosed to him, ""it is inconceivable that the plaintiff would have advanced his money as he did"". In this case, it seems to me, one asks what Optus would have done had it been told what it should have been told. For the reasons that follow, the answer is clear: it would not have stored its EOL stock through Almad with Sumo, nor paid Almad its 20% markup for such storage. 

257If Mr Curtis were to obtain the consent of Optus to what otherwise would have been a clear breach of fiduciary duty (or to obtain exoneration from any past breach of duty), it would have been necessary for him to make full disclosure to Optus of his involvement in Sumo and, thus, on both sides of the transactions in which Sumo participated. To the extent that he was seeking exoneration for past breaches, Mr Curtis would also have been required to disclose the full extent of those breaches, and the benefits received by Sumo. 

258It is inconceivable that, if the requisite disclosures had been made, Optus would have consented to Mr Curtis' continuing in business as a supplier to Optus, for as long as he remained an employee of Optus. I take that from Mr Wilkie's evidence. Further, there is significant corroboration of this from the nature of activities undertaken by Mr Curtis. It is clear that he acted covertly, in the way that he did, so as to conceal from his superiors the fact of his involvement in Sumo as a supplier to Optus. 

259Thus, if Optus had been asked to consider whether it should lease its own warehouse for the storage of EOL goods, or whether it should continue to pay Sumo (knowing of Mr Curtis' involvement) with a markup to Almad, the answer that would have been given is, I think, clear. Optus would not have continued with the arrangements that in fact Mr Curtis put into place. 

260The question is not, as Mr Rayment appeared to suggest, whether generally Optus obtained some benefit from Almad's services. It is whether, but for Mr Curtis' breaches of fiduciary duty, Optus would have stored its EOL stock in the way that was done (with Sumo, and with Almad charging a 20% markup) or whether it would have proceeded with the proposal to lease a warehouse of its own. 

261As I have said, the answer is clear: Optus would have chosen the latter course. 

262Accordingly, I conclude that Optus has made good in principle its claim for equitable compensation, as to the Almad markup. 

263Optus quantifies this aspect of its claim for equitable compensation at an amount of $1,879,333, together with interest. It calculates that amount as follows:

(1) the total amount paid to Almad over the relevant period was about $18,399,000; 

(2) about $7,120,000 was paid for costs other than storage of pallets and related expenses;

(3) the balance to which the calculations should be directed is, therefore, about $11,279,000;

(4) Almad's markup was 20%;

(5) thus, the amount of the markup is one-sixth of the total paid, or about $1,879,333. 

264Mr Rayment's submissions did not address the precise quantification of the sum. Mr Stoljar accepted that, if I were to conclude that Optus should have equitable compensation, it should be left to the parties either to work out the sum involved or to put submissions as to its quantification. 

265As the schedule referred to at [12] above indicates, the claim for equitable compensation is one made by Singtel Optus, because it is that company's EOL stock that was stored by Sumo. 

266Since I have concluded that Optus has not proved its overcharging case, it has no entitlement to equitable compensation for the alleged overcharging. 

Second issue: the knowing involvement of Sumo, Mr Hasler and Electrosales

The claim against Sumo

267There can be no doubt that Sumo was knowingly involved in Mr Curtis' breach of fiduciary duty. It was his creature. He effectively controlled its operations. Mr Stoljar submitted that Mr Curtis was a shadow director, and I agree. Mr Curtis' knowledge was Sumo's knowledge. Sumo was the recipient of the benefits procured by Mr Curtis' breaches of fiduciary duty. 

268On the evidence, the profits that Sumo made (over the years from 2004 to 2010 when it was profitable) were derived substantially, if not entirely, from the business it did for Optus. Such work as was done for other customers was, at its highest, marginal. 

269In principle, therefore, Sumo should be required to account for the total of the profits that it did make for the years that I have identified. And, because those profits were diminished by the corrupt payments made to the Harmanis and Zotz families (which were disguised as payments of wages or salary), the amounts of those payments should be added back.

270Sumo continued to store goods for Optus during the 2011 financial year. That storage ceased in about December 2010 or January 2011, in circumstances to which I shall return. Sumo made a substantial loss for that year, no doubt because of the loss of the Optus business. (This of itself illustrates the proposition that the profits made by Sumo were derived from the business of Optus.) 

271Mr Stoljar submitted that Optus was entitled to an account of profits and was not required to absorb the losses. In principle, I think, that is correct. It is often said that a defaulting fiduciary (or a person liable to account for knowing involvement in the defaults of her fiduciary) may be entitled to some allowance for time and skill. I do not think that this is an appropriate case to make such an allowance. But if it were, the fact is that the profits earned by Sumo are profits net of all proper expenses, so that the effect of making just allowances has been achieved in any event. 

The claim against Electrosales 

272I turn next to the position of Electrosales, because that requires some attention to the authorities on which Optus relied.

273At first, one might wonder why Electrosales was involved. But it, too, was no more than a corporate creature embodying Mr Curtis' mind and will. The evidence showed that Mr Curtis used Electrosales for the purpose of storing some of Optus' stock, and that Electrosales rendered invoices to Almad which were in due course passed on to Optus. 

274Mr Rayment did not address the question, whether (in the event that I were to conclude, as I have, that Mr Curtis had breached his duties) Electrosales should be made liable as an entity knowingly involved in the breach. In the circumstances, I take it from Mr Rayment's silence on the point that, if the principal question is decided against Mr Curtis, then the secondary question, insofar as it involves Electrosales, should be decided against that company. 

275This is not a case where it has been shown that Electrosales obtained some identifiable profit from those of Mr Curtis' breaches of fiduciary duty that were conducted through it, or involving it (compare Warman International v Dwyer (1995) 182 CLR 544 at 560). That, no doubt, is why Optus elected to claim equitable compensation rather than an account of profits. 

276Mr Stoljar relied on the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Grimaldi v Chameleon Mining NL (No.2) (2012) 200 FCR 296. In that case, the Court said at [556] that where the advantage of a fiduciary's wrongdoing accrues to a third party which is the alter ego or nominee of the fiduciary, that third party will be jointly and severally liable with the fiduciary. The remedies claimed may be either an account of profits or compensation to restore the trust property or for loss resulting from the wrongdoing.

277The claim against Electrosales for equitable compensation was made in two distinct ways. First, Singtel Optus claimed equitable compensation, in the full amount claimed against Mr Curtis (that is to say, in respect of both the overcharge case and the Almad markup case). This claim was made on the basis that Electrosales had been knowingly involved in Mr Curtis' breaches of fiduciary duty. 

278Secondly, all three plaintiffs claimed compensation under s 1317H of the Corporations Act. That claim was made on the basis that Electrosales was knowingly involved in Mr Curtis' breaches of ss 182 and 183. The amount was quantified in the same way. Optus made it clear that the amount claimed on this basis was ""less any amounts covered by"" the claim for equitable compensation. 

279For the reasons given at [248] and [249] above, in respect of the primary claims against Mr Curtis, it is not necessary to pursue the alternative way in which Optus put its case against Electrosales. 

280There is no principle that, where it has been shown that an ""assistant"" has been knowingly involved in a breach of duty by a fiduciary, the liabilities of the fiduciary and the assistant must necessarily be the same. It is clear, for example, that one may be called upon to make compensation, and the other to account for profits. And it is equally clear that the measure of loss recoverable from each may differ. So much follows from the observations of the plurality (Gummow ACJ, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Bell JJ) in Michael Wilson and Partners Limited v Nicholls (2011) 86 ALJR 14 at [106]: 

[106] As MWP rightly pointed out, this court has held74 that liability to account as a constructive trustee is imposed directly upon a person who knowingly assists in a breach of fiduciary duty. The reference to the liability of a knowing assistant as an ""accessorial"" liability does no more than recognise that the assistant's liability depends upon establishing, among other things, that there has been a breach of fiduciary duty by another. It follows, as MWP submitted, that the relief that is awarded against a defaulting fiduciary and a knowing assistant will not necessarily coincide in either nature or quantum. So, for example, the claimant may seek compensation from the defaulting fiduciary (who made no profit from the default) and an account of profits from the knowing assistant (who profited from his or her own misconduct). And if an account of profits were to be sought against both the defaulting fiduciary and a knowing assistant, the two accounts would very likely differ.75 It follows that neither the nature nor the extent of any liability of the respondents to MWP for knowingly assisting Mr Emmott in a breach or breaches of his fiduciary obligations depends upon the nature or extent
of the relief that MWP obtained in the arbitration against Mr Emmott.

281As I have mentioned already, the Full Court held in Grimaldi at [556] that where the assistant is the alter ego or nominee of the defaulting fiduciary, their liabilities would be joint and several. But the example their Honours gave (based on Gencorp Limited v Dalby (2002) 2 BCLC 734) was of a fiduciary who diverted unlawful commissions ""into his own creature company"" (para 26). 

282The facts in this case are not at all similar. It is clear that, to a very large extent, it was Sumo that was the beneficiary of Mr Curtis' breaches of fiduciary duty. To the extent that Electrosales also benefited, it appears to have done so on a somewhat random basis. 

283The submissions for Optus did not seek to demonstrate the extent to which Electrosales had benefited from such storage charges as it had claimed and was paid in respect of Optus' goods. Nor did those submissions seek to demonstrate (for example) the ratio between the volume of ""Optus"" storage undertaken by Sumo through Almad and the volume of such storage undertaken by Electrosales through Almad. 

284So far as the evidence goes, it cannot be suggested that Electrosales was knowingly involved in the whole of Mr Curtis' breaches of fiduciary duty. In those circumstances, I have some difficulty in understanding how it can be held liable to pay compensation, jointly and severally, with Mr Curtis, for the consequences of all those breaches. This uncertainty has not been helped by the failure, remarked upon already, of the defendants' submissions to address this point. 

285I accept that the Full Court in Grimaldi raised as a possibility, at [558], that ""when wrongdoers ... entangle their affairs, ... the law as a matter of legal policy might wish to make it their responsibility - and not a claimant's - to untangle them for accountability purposes"". However, this is not such a case (at least, in so far as the involvement of Electrosales is concerned). Perhaps more importantly, their Honours were raising this as an issue for consideration, not stating it as a concluded principle upon which an assessment of compensation could proceed. 

286In all the circumstances, and notwithstanding the failure of the submissions for Electrosales to address the point, I do not consider that Optus has made good a claim for equitable compensation against Electrosales, as an assistant, for the full amount of Mr Curtis' liability, as a defaulting fiduciary. In principle, it seems to me, the measure of compensation should be limited to the measure of the benefit obtained by Electrosales through its knowing involvement in those breaches. 

287Since the evidence does not permit a conclusion as to the amount that would be ordered on this basis, I will leave it to the parties either to address further on how this might be done or to seek a reference out, or some other mechanism, for quantification of Electrosales' liability. 

The claim against Mr Hasler 

288The case made against Mr Hasler is that he was knowingly involved in Mr Curtis' breaches of fiduciary duty because, at the very least, Mr Hasler had knowledge of circumstances which would indicate to an honest and reasonable person that Mr Curtis was acting in breach of his fiduciary duties to Optus (see Farah Constructions Pty Limited v Say-Dee Pty Ltd (2007) 230 CLR 89 at [174] to [177]; and see Grimaldi at [268], [269]). 

289Optus also claims against Mr Hasler for what it says is his knowing involvement in Mr Curtis' breaches of duties under ss 182 and 183 of the Corporations Act. 

290In my view, Optus has shown that Mr Hasler knew of matters or activities (on the part of Mr Curtis) that, to an honest and reasonable person, would speak of breach of duty. Indeed, I think, the conclusion can be expressed more strongly. 

291Mr Hasler was deeply and directly involved in the relevant activities, from the setting up of Sumo, through the diversion of Optus business to it, up to the provision of services, the rendering of invoices and the receipt of payment. Once Mr Hasler left the employ of Optus, he managed the warehouse business on a day to day basis. To my mind, Mr Hasler had actual knowledge of all matters that show breach of fiduciary duty on the part of Mr Curtis. And Mr Hasler, by his actions that I have briefly outlined, was directly involved in those breaches. 

292The submissions that were put for Mr Hasler addressed the matter principally by reference to the pleaded case against him. In relation to the claim for accessory liability, they are aptly summarised at the conclusion of para 36 of the closing submissions: 

The principal allegations made against [Mr Hasler] are those under the second limb of Barnes v Addy and he is not shown to have been aware of any dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of Mr Curtis. The plaintiffs' opening at paragraphs 36-50, like its [sic] pleading, conspicuously does not allege any dishonest or fraudulent design on the part of Mr Curtis, let alone any knowledge of such dishonest or fraudulent design on the part of Mr Hasler. The case against him lacks any substance.

293There are a number of points to be noted about this approach. The first is that it focuses on the pleadings, and not in any detail on the evidence that was given without objection. 

294The second point is that, to the extent that it suggests that subjective knowledge is an ingredient of accessory liability for breach of fiduciary duty, it is wrong. 

295The third point, flowing from the first two, is that whether or not Optus pleaded a dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of Mr Curtis, there is no doubt that it proved facts which could and should be so characterised. 

296The fourth point is that on any view, Mr Hasler knew of the essential facts that show breach of fiduciary duty on the part of Mr Curtis. Mr Hasler knew that: 

(1) Mr Curtis was an employee of Optus Administration, performing his duties for the benefit of the other plaintiffs; 

(2) Mr Curtis' responsibilities included managing Optus' needs for transport and warehousing of its goods;

(3) Mr Curtis had cooperated with Mr Hasler to set up Sumo as a company offering, in particular, warehousing services; 

(4) Mr Curtis had caused, directly or through employees, Sumo to become a supplier of warehousing services to Optus. 

297It may perhaps be (although I doubt it) correct to say, as Mr Rayment submitted, that Mr Hasler did not know that Mr Curtis had not obtained the informed consent of Optus to these activities. (It is certainly correct to say that Mr Hasler did not know that Mr Curtis had obtained such consent.) It may also be, as Mr Rayment submitted, that, subjectively, Mr Hasler saw nothing wrong with these activities. The simple fact is, however, that Mr Hasler knew of the elements of breach of fiduciary duty, and with that knowledge assisted in the execution of the breaches. 

298Whether or not, subjectively, Mr Hasler appreciated that what was going on was dishonest or fraudulent is immaterial. The facts which were known to Mr Hasler, regarded objectively, demonstrate breach of fiduciary duty. And the facts as to Mr Hasler's activities show that he assisted in, or facilitated, or furthered, that breach. 

299There is a question as to the extent of Mr Hasler's knowledge of the payments made to the Harmanis family and the Zotz family. He says that he did not know before January 2009. I accept that aspect of his evidence. Thus, to the extent that the making of those payments is available for Optus to rely on as showing the requisite dishonest and fraudulent design, it does not apply to Mr Hasler before January 2009. And given his lack of involvement in the making of the payments thereafter, I would conclude that it is not relevant to him thereafter. 

300There was a substantial dispute as to whether Optus had pleaded and proved the elements of accessory liability: in particular, the existence of the fraudulent and dishonest design, and the existence of Mr Hasler's knowledge of that design. Mr Rayment submitted that the relevant matters had not been pleaded, and that Optus should be held to the pleaded case. Mr Stoljar did not accept that the case was insufficiently pleaded, but said that, in any event, the court was required to decide the issues on the basis of the way that the parties' cases had been opened, and on the evidence that had been adduced without objection thereafter. 

301Mr Stoljar's second, or alternative, submission is plainly correct. As Dawson J said in Banque Commerciale SA (In Liq) v Akhil Holdings Ltd (1990) 169 CLR 279 at 297, ""[s]pecial procedures apart, cases are determined on the evidence, not the pleadings"". See, in this regard, Ingot Capital Investments Pty Ltd v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets Ltd (2008) 73 NSWLR 653 at [424] where Ipp JA summarised the position as follows:

The following propositions may be extracted from these authorities:

(a) The rule that, in general, relief is confined to that available on the pleadings secures a party's right to a basic requirement of procedural fairness.
(b) Apart from cases where the parties choose to disregard the pleadings and to fight the case on additional issues chosen at the trial, the relief that may be granted to a party must be founded on the pleadings.
(c) It may be that, in a clear case, mere acquiescence by one party in a course adopted by the other will be sufficient to ground an inference that the parties have chosen a different basis to the pleaded issues for the determination of their respective rights and liabilities.
(d) Acquiescence giving rise to a departure from the pleadings may arise from a failure to object to evidence that raises fresh issues - it is in this sense that ""cases are determined on the evidence, not the pleadings"".
(e) While cases are to be decided upon a basis that embraces the ""real controversy"" between the parties, the real controversy has to be determined in accordance with the principles stated.

302The fourth of those five propositions is of particular relevance in this case. 

303Having come to that view, it is unnecessary to express a concluded view about the pleading point. I will however indicate that if Optus had been confined to its pleaded case, it would have had considerable difficulty in persuading me that the ""knowing involvement"" claim against Mr Hasler had been pleaded and particularised with the requisite particularity. 

304The claims pressed against Mr Hasler are: 

(1) by Singtel Optus, for equitable compensation for knowing involvement in Mr Curtis' breaches of fiduciary duty; and 

(2) by all plaintiffs, for compensation under s 1317H of the Corporations Act, for knowing involvement in Mr Curtis' breaches of ss 182 and 183. 

305The compensation sought is the same in each case, and MFI F (see at [12] above) makes it clear that the second claim is pressed only to the extent that full compensation is not awarded under the first.

306As I have said, I think it is clear, at a minimum, that Mr Hasler had actual knowledge of facts that would suggest, to an honest and reasonable person, that Mr Curtis had breached his fiduciary duties to Optus. The evidence shows, further, that Mr Hasler was directly involved in the acts which constituted or effected those breaches of duty. And that is so even if one puts to one side the case based on the corrupt payments made to the Harmanis family and the Zotz family. 

307It must follow, in my view, that Mr Hasler is jointly and severally liable with Mr Curtis to make equitable compensation to Optus for the loss that it has proved: namely, the Almad markup. 

Third issue: the overcharging case against Almad

308The overcharging claim (or so much of it as was pressed in final submissions) was based on terms said to have been implied into the ""contracts for the provision of the transport and logistics management services"" made between Almad and Optus, as constituted or evidenced by Almad's invoices to Optus (FACLS, para 17). Optus said (para 18) that those contracts included implied terms to the following effect: 

(1) that Almad would only charge Optus for services actually provided, and would not overcharge; 

(2) that Almad would act reasonably and in good faith towards Optus in the exercise of its contractual powers, including in respect of charging; and 

(3) that Almad and Optus would cooperate to give each other the benefit of those contracts. 

309Almad did not admit that the first of those terms should be implied, but did admit that the second and third should be. 

310In the result, it is not necessary to express a conclusion on implication. For the reasons I have given at [144] to [215] above, Optus has failed to prove the remaining part of its overcharging case against Almad that was pressed in final submissions. 

Fourth issue: claim against Almad for misleading or deceptive conduct

311Mr Stoljar submitted that Almad, through Mr Davey, was aware during what Optus calls ""the Period"" (defined in FACLS as 1 April 2005 until December 2010) of the following matters: 

1. Curtis while holding a senior position with the Optus Group was preparing and sending Sumo invoices to MTM and, or alternatively, Almad in relation to storage provided to SingTel Optus;

2. Curtis while holding a senior position with the Optus Group was also acting for the benefit of Sumo or persons associated with Sumo;

3. Either Curtis or Hasler or both had, or there was a real risk that they had, used their positions or information acquired by him or them in the course of their employment with the Optus Group for the benefit of Sumo and those associated with it (including Curtis and Hasler) and, or alternatively, otherwise than for the benefit of the Optus Group;

4. during the Period either Curtis or Hasler or both had, or there was a real risk that they had, engaged in conduct by reason of which his or their interests in and, or alternatively, duties to the Optus Group were in conflict with his or their interests in, and or alternatively, duties to Sumo;

5. either Curtis or Hasler or both had, or there was a real risk that they had, failed to obtain the informed consent of the Optus Group to engage in the conduct pleaded in (a) - (d) above; and 

6. Almad was overcharging for the rate for pallet storage for EOL Stock ...

312Mr Stoljar submitted that, in all the circumstances, a party in the position of Optus with whom Almad was dealing would reasonably have expected that Almad would disclose those matters. Thus, he submitted, the failure to disclose was misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive. He relied on well known statements of principle in Demagogue Pty Limited v Ramensky (1992) 39 FCR 31 and Kimberley NZI Finance Ltd v Torero Pty Ltd [1989] ATPR (Digest) 53,193 at 53,195. 

313Mr Stoljar submitted that Almad (or Mr Davey) was a trusted and long-term supplier of services to Optus, and that (as Mr Davey must have understood) Optus reposed a degree of trust and confidence in Almad. In particular, Mr Stoljar submitted, Mr Davey (it is convenient to pierce the corporate veil) must have understood that Optus relied on him to exercise skill and diligence in relation to services provided through his efforts to Optus. 

314Against that background, Mr Stoljar submitted (written closing submissions, para 257):

257. At the same time, however, Almad knew many of the remarkable circumstances arising in this case, including: 

(1) Mr Davey had been told by Ms Grech in no uncertain terms that Mr Curtis and Mr Hasler operating a warehouse storing Optus stock would involve a conflict a conflict of interest. As Mr Grech deposes in her affidavit of 1 August 2013 at [8]: 


Me: How can Craig and Leon run a warehouse storing Optus stock while they are still working for Optus? Surely that's a conflict of interest? 

Davey: That's got nothing to do with us. 

Me: I am not comfortable with this at all. I don't see how it can be legal and I don't want to get involved. I can't imagine Optus consenting to this arrangement.

(2) Mr Davey knew that Mr Curtis was, on the one hand, approving pricelists or setting rates for Sumo and, on the other, approving pricelists or setting rates on behalf of Optus. In other words Davey knew that Mr Curtis was on both sides of the transaction; 


(3) there had been no public tender in respect of the services provided by Almad; 


(4) the very reason for Almad being or continuing to be involved in the Sumo arrangement, let alone receiving a mark up of 20%, is unclear, other than to disguise the involvement of Sumo. Mr Davey must have realised that if Mr Curtis was working legitimately for Optus there was no reason for him to be retaining Almad, and thereby causing Optus to pay increased fees, locating and arranging services that Curtis was in substance providing himself; 


(5) the transfer of stock from MTM to Almad in early 2005 involved an unexplained price increase from $2.30 to $3.00 per pallet per week where they did not seem to have been warranted. 

315In those circumstances, Mr Stoljar submitted, ""Optus could reasonably have expected that Almad would disclose what it knew, and Almad's failure to do so was misleading and deceptive"" (para 259). 

316It is convenient to start with the ""remarkable circumstances"" to which Mr Stoljar referred. Taking them one by one: 

(1) I do not accept the evidence of Mrs Grech that the conversation on which Mr Stoljar relied occurred. 

(2) Mr Davey undoubtedly knew ""that Mr Curtis was on both sides of the transaction."" See his evidence at T282.19-.34:

Q. Then you say ""So I offered Optus a storage solution using Sumo as a replacement for CALM? 
A. Correct. 

Q. Who did you make that offer to? 
A. Alex and Leon. 

Q. Mr Harmanis and Mr Curtis? 
A. Yep. 

Q. Mr Curtis made a presentation to you about Sumo?
A. Correct. 

Q. And you then offered it back to Mr Curtis?
A. Correct. 

(3) this is undoubtedly correct; but the same appears to have been the case in respect of MTM and Transcoast, for the equivalent services that, eventually, Almad provided to Optus. 

(4) Mr Davey knew the underlying facts. That is to say, he knew that Mr Curtis, through Sumo, was providing services to Optus through Almad. He knew that Almad was charging a markup on those services. But it does not follow that Mr Davey must have appreciated that this was done ""to disguise the involvement of Sumo"". So far as Mr Davey knew, Almad was a supplier of services to Optus, just as MTM had been and just as Transcoast had been. What had changed was the identity of the entity by whom those services were provided. But there is no reason to think that Mr Davey knew that Mr Curtis had failed to receive clearance for this in accordance with whatever, to Mr Davey's way of thinking, the relevant procedures of Optus might have required. 

(5) I have found that Optus has failed to prove ""an unexplained price increase from $2.30 to $3.00 per pallet per week"". 

317In reality, the only significant matter of which Mr Davey was aware was the second: that Mr Curtis was in effect speaking for the parties on each side of the transaction. 

318The test, in assessing whether there has been misleading or deceptive conduct by reason of non-disclosure, must be objective: would a reasonable person, in all the circumstances, have expected a disclosure to be made? Thus, to the extent that Mr Davey failed to concern himself with the proprieties of the situation (and I have no doubt that, subjectively, he did not so concern himself), that is no defence. 

319In Hardy v Your Tabs Pty Limited [2000] NSWCA 150, Heydon JA referred to misleading or deceptive conduct by silence, which might occur by reason of failure to disclose when there had been occasions when disclosure would have been appropriate. Of course, his Honour was not intending to define in any comprehensive way the circumstances in which silence might amount to misleading or deceptive conduct. (For that matter, I doubt that any such comprehensive definition is possible.) But it is convenient to take that as a starting point, and to ask: when would it have been appropriate for Mr Davey to make disclosure? 

320The matters that I have taken from Mr Stoljar's submissions point to two occasions at least on which disclosure might have been appropriate: the suggested conversation with Mrs Grech, and the suggested overcharging. It seems to me that if either of those allegations had been made good (and a fortiori if both had been made good), it would have been appropriate for Mr Davey to reflect a little more, and to take up with Optus (other than through Mr Curtis) the fact that Mr Curtis was, as it was put, on both sides of the transaction. But since I have found that neither the conversation nor the overcharging have been proved, those occasions did not arise. 

321On my findings, the case for Optus, on this issue, must depend on the position that awareness of one fact only - that Mr Curtis was on both sides of the transaction - was sufficient to engender in Mr Davey an obligation of disclosure, so that silence (or failure to disclose) amounts to misleading or deceptive conduct. But why should that be so? Why was Mr Davey not entitled to think that whatever internal procedures Optus had in place for regulating conflicts of interest were not satisfied in the present case? 

322Mr Davey said that he thought this ""was a win, win, win for everyone... because I could help to solve Optus' problems of what they required... we managed to keep the price down... we got it [the storage rate] so cheap"" (T282.39 - 283.1). And implicit in this passage of Mr Davey's evidence is that it was a win for Sumo too, because its warehouse at Campbelltown was empty and Sumo needed to derive income: ""[t]hey were taking anything they could"" (T283.2). 

323In my view, the facts that have been proved are not such to engender any reasonable expectation of disclosure. It follows that the conceded non-disclosure cannot amount to misleading or deceptive conduct. 

Fifth issue: accessory liability for Almad's misleading or deceptive conduct

324In view of the conclusion that I have just reached, this issue does not arise. 

Sixth issue: the claims for conversion and bailment 

The claim against Sumo 

325Insofar as this issue relates to Sumo, it concerns EOL stock identified on schedules. The relevant evidence was given by Mr Natale. In substance, he gave evidence of two ""audits"" of ""processed disposals"": that is to say, of Optus stock that had been written off, through the appropriate disposal form (DF) and sent to Sumo for storage pending disposal. 

326The first audit suggested that Optus had disposed of inventory valued at over $10 million, but had located only about $1.2 million worth. That led to the second audit. The second audit was conducted after such Optus stock as Sumo still held was either removed from it or physically counted and verified. The second audit repeated the first audit, but for an earlier period. 

327Based on those two audits, Mr Natale concluded that Sumo had failed to account for a very substantial amount of EOL stock, which was listed on a spreadsheet that he prepared. 

328Optus called evidence from an expert, Mr Stuart Bettington, who has experience in the telecommunications market including in the disposal of EOL stock. He valued the missing stock (according to Mr Natale's spreadsheet) at $5.4 million. Mr Stoljar accepted (T707.23) that it would be appropriate to discount this by a factor of 10 to 20%, to allow for errors in the audit and for the possibility that some of the missing stock might have been in fact lawfully scrapped. (As to this latter point: Optus carried out a search of its own records and found only two instances of instructions to scrap stock listed on a DF.) 

329Sumo accepted the duties of a bailee for reward. At common law, it must therefore show either that it took reasonable care of the goods, or that such failure as there was to take care did not contribute to the loss. Neither of those things has been established. 

330In the circumstances, I conclude that Optus has made good its case against Sumo. Damages should be assessed at the lower end of the range ascertained by discounting Mr Bettington's figure. In round figures, he assessed the value of the stock at $5.4 million. 80% of that is $4.3 million. That, in my view, is the amount which should be awarded. 

The claims against Electrosales

331It is common ground that, as I have noted at [34] and [35] above, Electrosales did sell to Telecycling stock that had come from Optus. It has not been suggested that Optus authorised this sale. The issue was whether the stock was the property of Optus, or of Megatron. 

332I prefer the records created by Mr Curtis at the time to his subsequent, and in my view dishonest, evidence seeking to explain them away. Thus, I find that the stock was, at the time of the sale, the property of Optus. 

333It follows that Electrosales converted the stock the subject of that sale. It appears to be common ground that the stock should be valued at the sale price, $104,492.87, and that this is the amount of Optus' loss. 

334As I have noted already, the second alleged conversion - the sale to Braintree - was admitted and the agreed loss is $15,000.00.

335Optus is entitled to judgment against Electrosales, for conversion, in the sum of $119,492.87, together with interest. 

Seventh issue: relief

336Optus has made good its claims to relief, to the extent set out above. 

337Optus should bring in short minutes of order to reflect what it says are its entitlements as a result of those reasons. If the amount of equitable compensation payable by Electrosales (see at [287] above) cannot be agreed, the short minutes should provide a mechanism for quantifying that entitlement. 

338Clearly, there will be argument on costs. That will have to take place at a later time. 

Almad's cross-claim

339The cross-claim has two components. The first relates to invoices rendered but unpaid. The second refers to ""uninvoiced claims"": that is to say, claims for payment for services rendered that were not the subject of invoices. 

The invoiced claims 

340The only defence to these claims was a defence by way of set-off. Since I have concluded that all Optus' claims against Almad fail, that goes nowhere. 

341It follows that Almad is entitled to judgment for the total of the outstanding invoices, $458,662.84, together with interest. 

342I note that, of this amount, five-sixths is due to Sumo for the services provided by it (the subject of its invoices to Almad). One-sixth is due to Almad, as its markup. Although this was not suggested to give rise to any defence, it may be worth noting that Mr Davey said in substance that: 

(1) Almad had made some payments to Sumo already on account of its share of the total; and 

(2) if Almad recovered judgment, he would ensure that it accounted to Sumo's liquidator for whatever the balance owing might be. 

The uninvoiced claims. 

343Mr Davey's evidence was to the effect that Sumo had also provided storage services after the date of the last of the invoices that had been rendered (the subject of the claim I have just dealt with). Those invoices covered the period 29 October to 17 December 2010. 

344Mr Davey said that, for the following weeks, from 24 December 2010 to 18 February 2011, there were invoices ""drafted... but... not... issued"". Those draft, or unissued, invoices total $138,117.21. 

345Optus submitted that, quite apart from the question of set-off, it had no liability in respect of those invoices. The first reason given was that, as they had never been issued and as the claim was for payment pursuant to a contract (not on some quantum merit basis), there was no proof of any contract for provision of the services in question. 

346As what might be a variant of this reason, Optus submitted that Almad's pleaded position (appearing from its commercial list response) was that its contractual obligation was only to arrange for the storage of stock and equipment as requested from time to time. On that basis, Optus submitted, Almad's maximum claim would be its markup, or about $23,000.00.

347The second principal reason advanced by Optus was that, from 22 December 2010, Sumo had asserted a warehouseman's lien, and had refused to allow Optus to collect its stock. Optus submitted that Sumo should not be entitled to storage charges after the time (22 December 2010) when Optus had demanded the return of its stock, but had been prevented from doing so by the asserted lien. Thus, Optus said, Almad should not have its markup.

348The relevant facts fall within a narrow compass. On 17 December 2010, Mr Natale informed Mr Davey that Optus no longer wished to use Almad's services. That was confirmed by email from Ms Kate Reid of Optus to Mr Davey on 20 December 2010. That email stated, further, that Optus proposed ""to collect our goods"" the following day. 

349Sumo asserted a lien over all the goods for unpaid storage charges. 

350On 21 December 2010, Optus' lawyers, Minter Ellison, wrote to Almad. The letter recited the history and threatened legal action should Almad continue to refuse access to Optus or its agents to collect Optus' stock. 

351The following day, Minter Ellison wrote to Sumo threatening legal action should Sumo not permit Optus to recover its stock. 

352On 22 December 2010, Sumo's lawyers at the time, Baker Ryrie Rickards Titmarsh, wrote to Minter Ellison. The letter was tendered without objection, despite its being headed ""without prejudice except as to costs"". It proposed two alternatives to break the deadlock. One was that Sumo and Almad would release all but about $500,000.00 worth of Optus' goods. The other alternative need not be described. 

353Minter Ellison replied stating among other things:

... our client will accept the proposal set out in your letter to collect and remove our client's goods up to, and leaving in the warehouse goods to the value of $500,000.00, on the following conditions: 

...

(b) our client does not continue to pay ongoing storage charges for the goods so retained; and 

...

354Baker Ryrie Richards Titmarsh replied the following day, stating among other things: 

Our client accepts the variations contained in your [letter] to the proposal previously conveyed by us and has commenced loading this morning. 

355In those circumstances, Mr Stoljar submitted, there was an agreement between the parties, made for good consideration, that Optus would have no liability for storage charges beyond 22 December 2010. 

356In my view, that submission is correct. There was a position where each party was asserting rights against the other. There was a compromise, in which each party gave up some of its asserted rights. The promise of each party to forgo the full extent of its demands provides consideration for the promise of the other. 

357Thus, there was an enforceable agreement between Sumo and Optus containing a term, among other things, that Optus would have no liability for storage charges from 22 December 2010. Almad, as broker, can be in no better position. Specifically, if there were no storage services to manage, and no storage invoices to be vetted and passed on, then Almad can have no claim from 22 December 2010. 

358That leaves the brief period between from 17 to 22 December 2010. The paries' submissions did not address this. However, it is uncontentious that, on 17 December 2010, Optus gave Almad notice of termination of the arrangements that were in place between them. It would seem to follow that there could be no contractual claim after that notice had been given. Since no quantum merit or restitutionary claim was pleaded for this short period, I propose to treat it, as apparently the parties did, by giving it no (further) independent consideration. 

359The result is that Almad's claim for the uninvoiced charges must fail. 

Conclusion on the cross-claim 

360Almad is entitled to judgment on the first cross-claim in the sum of $458,662.84 together with interest. The parties should agree a calculation of interest, and the resultant judgment sum should be included in the draft orders to be prepared. 

361As with Optus' claim, I will hear the parties on costs. 

Conclusion and orders 

362I have reached the following conclusions on Optus' claims for relief (by reference to the claims set out at [12] above) and on Almad's cross-claim: 

(1) Singtel Optus succeeds on its claim against Mr Curtis for equitable compensation for breaches of fiduciary duty, but in the amount of $1,879,333.00 only, together with interest; 

(2) it is not necessary to express a concluded view on the claims by all three plaintiffs for compensation under s 1317H of the Corporations Act, nor the claim by Optus Administration for damages for breach of the employment contract; 

(3) the plaintiffs succeed in their claim against Sumo for an account of profits in respect of its knowing involvement in Mr Curtis' breaches of fiduciary duty, with no deduction for Sumo's losses in the 2011 financial year; and those profits should be augmented by adding back the payments made to the Harmanis and Zotz families; 

(4) it is not necessary to express a concluded view on the claims by all plaintiffs against Sumo for compensation under s 1317H of the Corporations Act;

(5) Singtel Optus succeeds in its claim against Mr Hasler for equitable compensation for knowing involvement in Mr Curtis' breaches of fiduciary duty, but in the amount of $1,879,333.00 together with interest;

(6) it is not necessary to express a concluded view on the claims by all plaintiffs against Mr Hasler for compensation under s 1317H of the Corporations Act;

(7) in principle, Singtel Optus is entitled to succeed in its claim against Electrosales for equitable compensation in respect of that company's knowing involvement in Mr Curtis' breaches of fiduciary duty, but the amount remains to be quantified; 

(8) it is not necessary to express a concluded view on the claims by all plaintiffs to recover compensation from Electrosales under s 1317H of the Corporations Act;

(9) the claims by Singtel Optus against Almad for breach of contract and for misleading or deceptive conduct fail, and thus the claims by Singtel Optus against Sumo, Mr Hasler and Electrosales for knowing involvement in those alleged activities also fail;

(10) Optus Networks succeeds in its claim against Sumo in conversion, but in the amount of $4,320,000.00 together with interest; 

(11) Singtel and Optus Networks succeed in their claims against Electrosales (and, to the extent that it overlaps, against Sumo) in conversion, in respect of the Telecycling sale, in the sum of $104,492.87; 

(12) Optus Networks succeeds in its (admitted) claim in conversion against Mr Curtis and Electrosales, in respect of the Braintree sale, in the sum of $15,000.00; and 

(13) Almad succeeds on its first cross-claim against Singtel Optus, but in respect of the invoiced amounts only, $458,662.84 together with interest. 

363It is likely (perhaps inevitable) that there will be a dispute as to the orders to be made; certainly so as to costs. The appropriate course is to direct the plaintiffs to bring in draft orders, and then to list the matter for directions so that, if necessary, a date for argument can be fixed, with appropriate directions. 

364Accordingly, I make the following orders: 

(1) direct the plaintiffs to serve on the defendants and to deliver to my Associate, by 14 October 2013, draft orders to give effect to these reasons; 

(2) list the matter for directions at 9:30am on 16 October 2013 before me;

(3) reserve costs;

(4) reserve liberty to apply on three days' notice.

		02 October 2013",2013-09-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706106,Attorney General of New South Wales v X and Anor [2013] NSWSC 1392,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: These proceedings raise for urgent determination an issue concerning the relationship between an order of a Judge releasing a person conditionally following a verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness and the powers and functions of the Mental Health Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal"") where such an order is made.

The Summons and Appearances

2By Summons filed 5 September 2013, the Plaintiff, the Attorney General of New South Wales (""Attorney General""), seeks declaratory relief. The First Defendant, X, is a forensic patient for the purposes of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""MHFP Act""). The First Defendant will be referred to in this judgment by use of the pseudonym ""X"" given the restriction on publication of the name of a person before the Tribunal: s.162 Mental Health Act 2007. 

3The Second Defendant, the Tribunal, has filed a submitting appearance in the proceedings in accordance with usual practice.

4X has been served for the purpose of these proceedings. He is presently residing as a patient at Macquarie Hospital. Evidence before the Court establishes that he does not wish to appear to defend the proceedings. A Notice of Appearance has not been filed on his behalf.

5In circumstances where there would otherwise be no contradictor, the Registrar of the Court liaised with the New South Wales Bar Association with the view to nomination of counsel prepared to act as amicus curiae. Mr Scott Fraser of counsel, who had appeared for X on prior occasions, indicated his willingness to perform this role. 

6At the hearing, Mr Fraser made application for leave to be heard as amicus curiae. Mr Kell of counsel, who appeared with Ms Phillips for the Attorney General, supported the application. 

7The hearing of an amicus curiae is entirely in the Court's discretion. The footing on which an amicus curiae is heard is that the person is willing to offer the Court a submission on law or relevant fact which will assist the Court in a way in which the Court would not otherwise have been assisted: Levy v State of Victoria [1997] HCA 31; 189 CLR 579 at 604. The appointment of counsel to act as amicus curiae served to provide a contradictor to the Attorney General's arguments where none otherwise would have appeared: Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Australia v Alinta Limited [2008] HCA 2; 233 CLR 542 at 568 [68]. 

8The present proceedings involve significant issues concerning the proper construction and operation of the MHFP Act. 

9Leave was granted to Mr Fraser to appear as amicus curiae and the Court is grateful to him for his preparedness to perform this role and for his careful written and oral submissions, which have assisted the Court in the resolution of the proceedings.

10For reasons that will shortly become clear, it was necessary that these proceedings be heard and determined urgently given the need for a ruling by the Court before 25 September 2013. 

Factual Background

11On 17 December 2010, X (then aged 19 years) entered a 7-Eleven store at Neutral Bay. He was armed with a pair of scissors. He said to the attendant ""Give me 50 bucks or I'm going to stab you"". The attendant said ""I can't give you 50 bucks"" and when he said he was going to call the police, and did so using an emergency button, X said ""I want you to call the police"" and began cutting his own left arm with the scissors. X was arrested and charged with attempted armed robbery. 

12On 26 September 2011, a trial in relation to that charge took place in the District Court before his Honour Judge Berman SC. His Honour found X, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, not guilty of the offence charged by reason of mental illness for the purpose of s.38 MHFP Act. 

13Having returned a special verdict under s.38, his Honour considered what order ought be made under s.39 MHFP Act. His Honour observed that this was the only occasion on which X had been involved with the criminal law and expressed his satisfaction, on the balance of probabilities, that X's safety and that of members of the public would not be seriously endangered if he was released from custody: s.39(2). 

14Having determined that release was appropriate, his Honour considered whether release ought be unconditional or subject to conditions. The Judge considered conditional release to be appropriate. The Judge turned to a submission on behalf of X that the conditions to be set should apply for a specified period. His Honour accepted this submission, stating that what had persuaded him to accept it was ""the principle that [X] should not be worse off after being found not guilty than he would have been if he had been found guilty"". His Honour continued:

""As Mr Fraser submits, were it the case that [X] pleaded guilty, in view of his age and mental condition and lack of criminal history I would not have sent him to gaol but probably released him on some form of bond. He should not, therefore, be worse off because I found him not guilty"".

15His Honour directed, pursuant to s.39 MHFP Act, that X be released from custody immediately subject to specified conditions for his treatment for a period of two years from that day. His Honour directed that the Registry provide to the Tribunal a copy of the finding, including the conditions attached to X's release, the transcript of the proceedings and a copy of the material tendered in the trial.

16I pause to observe that there is no question that the making of a conditional release order under s.39 MHFP Act rendered X a forensic patient, who thereby came under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal: s.42(a)(i) MHFP Act. 

17On 6 December 2011, the Tribunal conducted its first review of X under s.44 MHFP Act. In a written decision dated 22 February 2012 arising out of that review, the Tribunal determined that it should continue X's release, subject to the usual conditions of release imposed by the Tribunal which provided for a person's active case management in the community. The Tribunal subsequently imposed those conditions by order dated 5 March 2012. Those conditions were different in most respects from those set by the Judge on 26 September 2011. 

18In the course of the written first review decision dated 22 February 2012, the Tribunal addressed the effect of the two-year period included in the Judge's order. The Tribunal disagreed that the Court order could have the effect of time limiting X's conditional release.

19On 16 December 2011, X's matter was relisted before his Honour in the District Court. The Judge indicated that the matter had been relisted because a suggestion had been made to the Court that the order made on 26 September 2011 ""may have an unfortunate consequence"". The Judge explained:

""The suggestion was made that at the end of that two year period, the order that he be released from custody would cease to have effect, with the result that he would be required to enter some form of custody. Accordingly, the matter was listed before me for me to receive submissions as to whether the order that I made, had the effect that I envisaged.""

20His Honour noted that submissions had been made by the Crown and Mr Fraser which expressed the common view that the order which had been made would have the effect that the Court intended. According to the transcript of 16 December 2011, the Judge enquired of both counsel:

""Are you both confident that the effect of my order is that at the end of two years [X] will certainly not be taken into any form of custody and the effect of the order will be that he is no longer supervised"".

It appears that both counsel agreed with this statement. The Judge declined to make any amendment to the order made on 26 September 2011.

21Since the first review decision of 22 February 2012, X has been periodically reviewed by the Tribunal. It is not necessary, for the purpose of this judgment, to set out in detail events which have occurred since then. It is sufficient to observe that, on 19 December 2012, following a series of events which included X experiencing an acute dissociative episode, and admitting to his treating team that he had been using drugs and had no intention of returning to a drug and alcohol addiction treatment program in which he had been a participant, the Tribunal ordered a variation to its conditions. These conditions included a condition that X reside at Macquarie Hospital, with all leave privileges to be exercised at the discretion of the medical superintendent.

22The most recent Tribunal review of X occurred on 25 June 2013. The Tribunal published its decision in relation to that review on 30 July 2013. At those review proceedings, legal representatives appeared for X and for the Attorney General and made submissions, both orally and in writing, concerning the effect of the District Court order of 26 September 2011, and its relationship with the Tribunal's functions concerning the continued treatment of X. 

23After considering those submissions, the Tribunal (President Daniel Howard SC, Dr John Basson and Mr Stephen Woods) maintained the view taken by the Tribunal in the first review decision of 22 February 2012, namely that the Tribunal had the power to impose its own conditions for X's release, which included the power to vary or remove any time limit upon X's conditional release imposed under the District Court order.

24In the seventh review decision of 30 July 2013, the Tribunal stated that given the psychiatric report and risk assessment it had received concerning X, the Tribunal was satisfied that further stabilisation of X's condition was necessary. The Tribunal determined that X should continue to remain in his current placement at Macquarie Hospital until his mental state and behaviour stabilised. The Tribunal noted that the terms of the conditional release order of 19 December 2012 would continue to apply to X, and that the Tribunal proposed to hold a further review with respect to him in six months' time. 

25Accordingly, it is clear that the Tribunal contemplated that these conditions would continue to bind X, and require him to reside at Macquarie Hospital, beyond 25 September 2013, being the final day of the two-year period specified in the District Court order.

26In these circumstances, as I have observed, the present Summons was brought before the Court for urgent hearing and determination. 

Relief Claimed in the Summons

27The Attorney General seeks declaratory relief in the following terms:

(a) A declaration that the decision by the Tribunal dated 30 July 2013, made following a forensic review of X on 25 June 2013 under s.46(1) MHFP Act, is valid.

(b) A declaration that the order for variation to conditional release made by the Tribunal under the MHFP Act in relation to X on 19 December 2012, the continued application of which was noted in the decision of 30 July 2013, has, and will continue after 25 September 2013 to have, full force and effect according to its tenor, subject only to any further order made by the Tribunal or the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

(c) A declaration that the District Court order under s.39 MHFP Act made on 26 September 2011 does not limit the time period during which the conditional release order of 19 December 2012, or any further order made by the Tribunal varying or substituting that order, has or will have operative effect.

(d) A declaration that the District Court order of 26 September 2011 does not have the effect that, after 25 September 2013, X will cease to be a forensic patient under the MHFP Act.

Relevant Provisions of the MHFP Act

28It will be necessary to say something concerning the legislative history of the provisions falling for consideration, before turning to the resolution of the matters in controversy in these proceedings. Before doing so, however, it is appropriate to set out some key provisions of the MHFP Act. 

29Part 4 MHFP Act (ss.37-39) is entitled ""Defence of mental illness"". Part 4 relates to persons tried on indictment. Provision is made elsewhere in the MHFP Act (Part 3 - ss.31-36) concerning summary proceedings relating to persons affected by mental disorders. Sections 37-39 provide:

""37 Explanation to jury

If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, a question is raised as to whether the person was, at the time of commission of the offence, mentally ill as referred to in section 38, the Court must explain to the jury the findings which may be made on the trial and the legal and practical consequences of those findings and must include in its explanation:

(a) a reference to the existence and composition of the Tribunal, and

(b) a reference to the relevant functions of the Tribunal with respect to forensic patients, including a reference to the requirements of this Act that the Tribunal may make an order for the release of a person detained in accordance with section 39 only if the Tribunal is satisfied, on the evidence available to it, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release.

38 Special verdict

(1) If, in an indictment or information, an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.

(2) If a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness is returned at the trial of a person for an offence, the Court may remand the person in custody until the making of an order under section 39 in respect of the person.

39 Effect of finding and declaration of mental illness

(1) If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, the jury returns a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, the Court may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law or may make such other order (including an order releasing the person from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions) as the Court considers appropriate.

(2) The Court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release.

(3) As soon as practicable after the making of an order under this section, the Registrar of the Court is to notify the Minister for Health and the Tribunal of the terms of the order.""

30Where the defence of mental illness is raised, a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness may be returned by the jury (or the Judge at a Judge-alone trial) under s.38(1). The Judge must direct the jury in accordance with s.37 at such a trial: R v Rodriguez [2010] NSWSC 198 at [56]-[57]. The Court may remand the person in custody under s.38(2) until the making of an order under s.39, but there is no power to grant bail during this period. The terms of s.39 arise directly for consideration in these proceedings.

31Part 5 MHFP Act (ss.40-76K) is entitled ""Forensic patients and correctional patients"". This part governs the powers, duties and functions of the Tribunal. 

32The objects of Part 5, as contained in s.40, are important:

""40 Objects

The objects of this Part are as follows:

(a) to protect the safety of members of the public,

(b) to provide for the care, treatment and control of persons subject to criminal proceedings who are suffering from a mental illness or mental condition,

(c) to facilitate the care, treatment and control of any of those persons in correctional centres through community treatment orders,

(d) to facilitate the provision of hospital care or care in the community through community treatment orders for any of those persons who require involuntary treatment,

(e) to give an opportunity for those persons to have access to appropriate care.

Note. Section 68 of the Mental Health Act 2007 sets out general principles with respect to the treatment of all people with a mental illness or mental disorder.""

33The functions of the Tribunal under the MHFP Act are to be exercised by the Forensic Division of the Tribunal, a specialist body constituted under s.73 MHFP Act. Section 74 specifies matters for consideration by the Tribunal when determining what order to make under Part 5:

""74 Matters for consideration

Without limiting any other matters the Tribunal may consider, the Tribunal must have regard to the following matters when determining what order to make about a person under this Part:

(a) whether the person is suffering from a mental illness or other mental condition,

(b) whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that care, treatment or control of the person is necessary for the person's own protection from serious harm or the protection of others from serious harm,

(c) the continuing condition of the person, including any likely deterioration in the person's condition, and the likely effects of any such deterioration,

(d) in the case of a proposed release, a report by a forensic psychiatrist or other person of a class prescribed by the regulations, who is not currently involved in treating the person, as to the condition of the person and whether the safety of the person or any member of the public will be seriously endangered by the person's release,

(e) in the case of the proposed release of a forensic patient subject to a limiting term, whether or not the patient has spent sufficient time in custody.""

34Section 42 is in the following terms:

""42 Forensic patients

For the purposes of this Act, the following persons are forensic patients:

(a) a person who is detained in a mental health facility, correctional centre or other place, or released from custody subject to conditions, pursuant to an order under:

(i) section 14, 17 (3), 24, 25, 27 or 39, or

(ii) section 7 (4) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (including that subsection as applied by section 5AA (5) of that Act),

(b) a person who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section.""

35It will be seen that a person released unconditionally under s.39 does not become a forensic patient by operation of s.42. However, a person who is detained or released subject to conditions under s.39 does become a forensic patient. 

36Once a person has become a forensic patient, the Tribunal is bound to conduct an initial review under s.44, which provides:

""44 Persons found not guilty by reason of mental illness - initial review

(1) The Tribunal must review a person's case as soon as practicable after the person is found not guilty of an offence by reason of mental illness, after a special hearing, a trial or on an appeal, and ordered to be detained in a mental health facility or other place or to be released from custody subject to conditions.

Note. Relevant orders may be made under this Act (including sections 25 and 39) and under section 7 (4) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (including that subsection as applied by section 5AA (5) of that Act).

(2) The Tribunal must, after reviewing a person's case, make an order:

(a) as to the person's care, detention or treatment, or

(b) as to the person's release (either unconditionally or subject to conditions).

(3) This section does not apply if a person ceases to be a forensic patient.""

37It will be observed from s.44(1) (and the note to that subsection) that the obligation of the Tribunal to conduct an initial review arises (relevantly, for present purposes) as soon as practicable after a person is found not guilty of an offence by reason of mental illness after a special hearing (under ss.19-24), after trial on indictment (under ss.37-39) or on appeal (where the Court of Criminal Appeal substitutes a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness and proceeds to make an order of detention or conditional release under s.7(4) Criminal Appeal Act 1912).

38Following the initial review, the Tribunal must make an order under s.44(2) MHFP Act.

39The criteria that must be considered by the Tribunal before releasing a forensic patient are contained in s.43:

""43 Criteria for release and matters to be considered by Tribunal

The Tribunal must not make an order for the release of a forensic patient unless it is satisfied, on the evidence available to it, that:

(a) the safety of the patient or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the patient's release, and

(b) other care of a less restrictive kind, that is consistent with safe and effective care, is appropriate and reasonably available to the patient or that the patient does not require care.""

40Section 46 requires the Tribunal to carry out further reviews of forensic patients periodically. Section 46 states:

""46 Further reviews by Tribunal of forensic patients

(1) The Tribunal must review the case of each forensic patient every 6 months but may review the case of any forensic patient at any time.

(2) The Tribunal must review the case of a forensic patient if requested to do so by the Minister for Health, the Attorney General, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Juvenile Justice, the Director-General or the medical superintendent of the mental health facility in which the patient is detained.

(3) The Tribunal must review the case of each forensic patient who is subject to a community treatment order, and who is detained in a correctional centre, every 3 months.

(4) The period within which a particular review under this section must be held may, on the motion of the Tribunal or on the application of the patient or the primary carer of the patient, be extended by the Tribunal to a maximum of 12 months.

(5) The Tribunal may grant an application to extend the review period if it is satisfied that:

(a) there are reasonable grounds to grant the application, or

(b) an earlier review is not required because:

(i) there has been no change since the last review in the patient's condition, and

(ii) there is no apparent need for any change in existing orders relating to the patient, and

(iii) an earlier review may be detrimental to the condition of the patient.""

41After undertaking a s.46 review, the Tribunal may make orders and recommendations under s.47, which provides:

""47 Orders and recommendations on further Tribunal reviews

(1) The Tribunal may, after reviewing the case of a forensic patient under section 46, make an order as to:

(a) the patient's continued detention, care or treatment in a mental health facility, correctional centre or other place, or

(b) the patient's release (either unconditionally or subject to conditions).

(2) The Tribunal must not make an order as to the release of a forensic patient if the patient is a person who has been remanded in custody pending the person's return to court but may make a recommendation to the court as to the person's release.

(3) An order for release under this section may be made despite any other provision of this Act or any order of a court under this Act.

(4) On reviewing under section 46 the case of a forensic patient who is subject to a finding that the person is unfit to be tried for an offence, the Tribunal must make a recommendation as to the fitness of the patient to be tried for an offence.

(5) The Tribunal must notify the court that made the finding of unfitness and the Director of Public Prosecutions if, on a review, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the person:

(a) has become fit to be tried for an offence, or

(b) has not become fit to be tried for an offence and will not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness by the court, become fit to be tried for the offence.""

42Sections 51 and 52 concern the circumstances in which classification as a forensic patient is terminated. The terms of s.51, in particular, were addressed in submissions and will require further consideration. Sections 51 and 52 provide:

""51 Termination of classification as forensic patient on unconditional release

(1) A forensic patient ceases to be a forensic patient if any of the following events occurs:

(a) the person is released unconditionally in accordance with an order by the Tribunal under this Part or by order of a court,

(b) if the person has been released in accordance with such an order subject to conditions - the time specified in the conditions as being a time during which those conditions, or any of them, are to be complied with expires.

(2) This section applies in addition to any other provision of this Subdivision.

52 Additional circumstances for termination of classification as forensic patient

(1) Verdict of not guilty or no limiting term after special hearing

A person who has been found to be unfit to be tried for an offence ceases to be a forensic patient if following a special hearing:

(a) the person is found not guilty of the offence concerned, or

(b) the person is found on the limited evidence available to have committed the offence but a limiting term is not imposed on the person.

(2) Detention after special hearing

A person who has been detained in a mental health facility, correctional centre or other place following a special hearing ceases to be a forensic patient if any of the following events occurs:

(a) the limiting term (where that term is less than life) imposed in respect of the person expires,

(b) the person is classified as an involuntary patient under section 53.

(3) Person found unfit to be tried by court

A person who has been found by a court to be unfit to be tried for an offence ceases to be a forensic patient if the Tribunal notifies the court and the Director of Public Prosecutions that it is of the opinion that the person has become fit to be tried for an offence (whether or not a special hearing has been conducted in respect of the offence) and a finding is made, at a further inquiry by the court as to the person's unfitness, that the person is fit to be tried for an offence.

Note. A person subject to a finding that the person is unfit to be tried for an offence, and who is released from detention under section 20 or 29, ceases to be a forensic patient by operation of section 51 (1).

(4) Dismissal of charges or no further proceedings
A person ceases to be a forensic patient if:

(a) the relevant charges against the person are dismissed, or

(b) the Director of Public Prosecutions notifies the court that the person will not be further proceeded against in respect of the relevant charges.

(5) Other circumstances

The regulations may make provision with respect to other circumstances in which the Tribunal may make an order terminating a person's status as a forensic patient.""

43Elaborate provision is made in s.77A for appeal to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal from determinations of the Tribunal:

""77A Appeals against Tribunal decisions

(1) A forensic patient or correctional patient who is a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal under this Act may appeal to the Supreme Court from any determination of the Tribunal in that proceeding, by leave of the Supreme Court:

(15) The Tribunal or any member of the Tribunal is not liable for any costs relating to a determination of the Tribunal, or the failure or refusal of the Tribunal to make a determination, in respect of which an appeal is made under this Act, or of the appeal.""

Legislative Background and History

44The written submissions on behalf of the Attorney General contained a comprehensive summary of the complex history of the MHFP Act, and amendments to that Act, in support of a submission (which I accept) that the legislative history and context assists the proper construction of the provisions in question in these proceedings. An understanding of the legislative history of provisions in the MHFP Act (and its predecessors), including s.39 and provisions concerning the powers and functions of the Tribunal, will assist in construing the legislation in its present form: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Dick [2007] NSWCA 190; 226 FLR 388 at 393 [26].

The 1990 Legislation

45The MHFP Act, as originally enacted, was named the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. The Act was renamed the MHFP Act by 2008 amending legislation which commenced on 1 March 2009. 

46In the original 1990 Act, s.39 provided that, upon the return of a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness, ""The Court must order that the person be detained in strict custody in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law"". 

47Chapter 5 of the Mental Health Act 1990 made provision for the treatment and control of persons the subject of a s.39 order, with such persons being forensic patients under the Mental Health Act 1990. That Act required the Tribunal to review a person's case as soon as practicable after the Court had made an order under s.39, and to conduct regular reviews of the person, with the Tribunal's function being to make recommendations to the Minister for Health as to the forensic patient's detention, care or treatment or release, either unconditionally or subject to conditions: ss.81-82 Mental Health Act 1990. 

48Recommendations by the Tribunal were ultimately referred to and acted upon by the ""prescribed authority"" (the Governor) who had power to make orders of conditional or unconditional release or, if release was not recommended, orders for care, treatment or detention: ss.84-85 Mental Health Act 1990.

49Section 101 Mental Health Act 1990 provided originally that a person who was a forensic patient, after having been found not guilty by reason of mental illness and being subject to a s.39 order, ceased to be a forensic patient: 

(a) on unconditional release by order of the prescribed authority (the Governor); or

(b) if the person had been released by order of the prescribed authority (the Governor) subject to conditions - on the expiry of any times specified in the conditions as being a time during which those conditions, or any of them, were to be complied with, 

whichever first occurred.

50It appears from s.101 Mental Health Act 1990 (and s.127 Mental Health Act 1983 which preceded that provision), that the legislature contemplated that the Governor could impose time-limited conditional release orders upon forensic patients, at the expiration of which such persons would cease to be forensic patients.

51On 16 November 2007, the Mental Health Act 1990 was repealed and replaced by the Mental Health Act 2007. The provisions relating to the review, detention, care and treatment of forensic patients previously contained in Chapter 5 of the Mental Health Act 1990 were substantially reinserted into Part 5 Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990.

The 2008 Amendments - The Tribunal Becomes the Decision Maker Subject to Appellate Review by Superior Courts

52From 1 March 2009, the Mental Health Legislation Amendment (Forensic Provisions) Act 2008 commenced, introducing a new regime for the management of forensic patients into Part 5 of the renamed MHFP Act. 

53The amendments gave effect to a number of recommendations made by the Hon GR James QC in his report entitled ""Review of the New South Wales Forensic Mental Health Legislation"", August 2007. 

54Amongst other things, the amendments abolished the system of executive discretion to determine the release of forensic patients, and vested that decision-making function in the Forensic Division of the Tribunal. Provision was made for appeals to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal from decisions of the Forensic Division of the Tribunal under s.77A MHFP Act: A by his Tutor Brett Anthony Collins v Mental Health Review Tribunal and Anor [2010] NSWSC 1363 at [29]ff (an appeal from that decision confined to the issue of costs was dismissed by the Court of Appeal: Collins v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 208). 

Legislative History of s.39 Since 1990

55As mentioned earlier, s.39, as originally enacted in 1990, required the Court to order in all cases where a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness was returned, that the person must be detained in strict custody until release by due process of law. The process which governed the release of such persons involved the exercise of executive discretion by the Governor, as the prescribed authority, upon recommendation of the Tribunal.

56Section 39 was amended in 1997 to remove the words ""in strict custody"" so as to provide courts with greater flexibility to order a person to be held in a hospital, rather than a prison (second reading speech, Mental Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, Legislative Council, Hansard, 20 May 1997). 


57In 2003, s.39 was further amended so that courts were no longer obliged to order the detention of persons in respect of whom a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness had been returned, but could also order the conditional or unconditional release of such persons. According to the second reading speech (Legislative Council, Hansard, 25 June 2003), the purpose of this amendment was to override the decision of Levine J in R v Stephens [1999] NSWSC 811 so as to give the Court an alternative to ordering detention in a hospital or in custody, allowing a Court to make orders, in effect, pending the review to be undertaken by the Tribunal and the Governor, in light of the Tribunal's recommendations. 

58I accept the submission of the Attorney General that the 2003 amendment to s.39 was not introduced to allow a court to make a time-limited order of the type made by the Judge in the present case.

59In 2004, amendments were made to provisions then contained in the Mental Health Act 1990, which extended the definition of a ""forensic patient"" to include persons found not guilty by reason of mental illness and ordered under s.39 to be released from custody subject to conditions. The purpose of these amendments was said to be to clarify that the Tribunal had the same powers in relation to persons released conditionally under s.39 as it had for other forensic patients detained under that provision (second reading speech, Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, Legislative Assembly, Hansard, 27 February 2004). 

60It was submitted on behalf of the Attorney General, correctly in my view, that a by product of this amendment was that persons who were released unconditionally by a court under s.39 would never become forensic patients by reason of that order, and would not fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. 

61In 2006, ss.39(2) and 39(3) were inserted into the MHFP Act. The purpose of s.39(2) was said to be to provide ""an extra layer of comfort to the community"" by specifically requiring courts to take public safety into account before making an order for a person's release under s.39(1) (second reading speech, Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Amendment Bill 2005, Legislative Assembly, Hansard, 8 November 2005).

Some Conclusions to be Drawn from Legislative History

62I accept the submission of the Attorney General that the drafting history outlined above with respect to s.39 MHFP Act, does not disclose any intention on the part of the legislature that an order made by a court conditionally releasing a person under s.39 would impinge upon, or otherwise regulate, the ongoing care and control of such persons by the Tribunal and (before 2009) the Governor acting after consideration of the Tribunal's recommendation. 

63To the contrary, I accept that the history of amendments to s.39 reflects that, in facilitating the making of conditional release orders under that provision, Parliament intended only to establish an additional mechanism, and a less oppressive mechanism than that which had previously applied, for referring persons in respect of whom a special verdict had been returned for the ongoing jurisdiction of the Tribunal with respect to forensic patients. 

Provisions in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912

64During the course of the hearing in this Court, consideration was given to provisions in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which provide for appeal under that Act from an order under s.39 MHFP Act. Brief reference should be made to those provisions. 

65An order under s.39 MHFP Act is included within the definition of ""Sentence"" in s.2(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

66On an appeal under s.5(1) against ""sentence"" by way of an order under s.39 MHFP Act, the Court of Criminal Appeal may make any finding, verdict, order or determination which could have been made in relation to the proceedings before the court of trial: s.6A(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

67Section 6A was introduced by the Criminal Appeal (Mental Illness) Amendment Act 1986, which applied (amongst other things) to an order under s.428ZB Crimes Act 1900 (the predecessor to s.39). The amendments to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (ss.6A and 7(4)) were intended to clarify that appeals could be made against specified orders or findings in relation to fitness to plead or mental illness, and to empower the Court of Criminal Appeal to make any necessary finding, verdict, order or determination in relation to those appeals (second reading speech, Criminal Appeal (Mental Illness) Amendment Bill 1986, Legislative Council, Hansard, 24 April 1986).

68Subject to one issue concerning the exercise of discretion to grant declaratory relief (see [118]-[121] below), I do not consider that the appeal provisions in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 bear upon any issue to be determined in these proceedings.

Submissions of Counsel

69Detailed and helpful written submissions were made by counsel for the Attorney General and by Mr Fraser and it is not necessary to set them out in detail in this judgment. A brief statement of the principal submissions of counsel is appropriate.

Submissions of Attorney General

70The Attorney General has not sought to challenge in these proceedings the validity of the District Court order, including the two-year limiting period. Rather, the Attorney General asks the Court to clarify the operation and effect of the District Court order, and particularly the time limit stipulated in it on the assumption that that order was validly made. 

71Mr Kell submitted that the apparent conflict between the District Court order and the Tribunal's position ought be reconciled on the basis that, notwithstanding his Honour's stated intention as to the effect the order would have, on a proper construction of the MHFP Act, a conditional release order made by a court under s.39 serves as an interim measure only. Accordingly, it was submitted that the District Court order, including the time limit within which it was expressed to apply, has been effectively superseded by subsequent orders made by the Tribunal in relation to X under Part 5 MHFP Act.

72It was submitted that resolution of the interaction between s.39 and provisions contained in Part 5 MHFP Act required consideration to be given to the relevant statutory language, viewed in context, including the general purpose and policy of the legislation and the mischief sought to be remedied.

73In the Attorney General's submission, the construction advanced at [71] above reflected the purpose of the s.39 conditional release power as being to bring a person found not guilty by reason of mental illness, and conditionally released by a court, within the jurisdiction and control of the Tribunal, but not to enable a court to bind the Tribunal to any particular course or period of care or treatment for that person.

74Specific submissions were made in support of this construction based upon a number of features, including:

(a) the interim nature of a court's order for conditional release under s.39(1) is reinforced by ss.39(3) and 44 MHFP Act;

(b) the absence of any provision within s.39 for setting a limiting period as part of an order for conditional release is to be contrasted with the specific power to fix a limiting term under ss.23-24 MHFP Act, where an accused person has been found, after a special hearing, to have committed the offence charged;

(c) the statutory scheme which involves a person in the position of X being a forensic patient under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, with the Tribunal to exercise its powers and functions over a period of time upon the basis of (no doubt) changing material, with the need for different conditions to be fixed by a specialist body;

(d) the fact that a s.39 order is not made by way of punishment so that any principles of sentencing, including proportionality, did not bear upon the decision.

75In addition, the Attorney General submitted that s.51, properly construed, did not support a contrary conclusion as contended by Mr Fraser.

76Mr Kell submitted that there was a live controversy so that declaratory relief should be granted to provide certainty concerning X's position after 25 September 2013.

Submissions of Amicus Curiae

77Mr Fraser submitted that it was open to the Judge to set the time period included in the order under s.39. He submitted that the concept of proportionality did bear upon the nature of the decision to be made. Considerations of the type taken into account by the Judge were, it was submitted, relevant and open to the Court. 

78Mr Fraser submitted that the continued status of a person such as X as a forensic patient carried with it a significant stigma. He submitted that, unless the two-year period specified by the Judge had effect, X was at risk of a potentially lengthy period as a forensic patient, with the Tribunal exercising significant powers and controls over his liberty. To the extent that X may have ongoing psychiatric issues, Mr Fraser submitted that these difficulties may be accommodated through the process of civil treatment, care and detention under the Mental Health Act 2007. 

79Mr Fraser pointed to the fact that a person who has been the subject of a limiting term following a special hearing, ceases to be a forensic patient on the expiration of the limiting term: s.52(2) MHFP Act. He contrasted this time-limited status as a forensic patient which operates where a person had not been acquitted, but had been found to have committed the offence in the limited way available at a special hearing. He submitted that, on the Attorney General's construction, a person such as X is worse off than a person who has been the subject of a limiting term following a special hearing. Mr Fraser submitted that X was worse off, in a practical sense, than he would have been had he pleaded guilty to the charge in the District Court and been sentenced, as the Judge mentioned, to a period of conditional liberty by way of a bond. 

80Counsel submitted that the legislative history of the relevant provisions represented a gradual passing of power from the Executive to both the Tribunal and the Courts, so that the construction he advanced was consistent with the legislative history.

81Mr Fraser submitted that s.51 MHFP Act ought be construed as terminating the status of a person as a forensic patient if the person was released subject to conditions under s.39 and the time specified in the conditions had expired: s.51(1)(b) MHFP Act. 

82To the extent that the Attorney General sought to rely upon the statutory scheme which saw the decision-making function in the Tribunal under Part 5 MHFP Act, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal under s.77A, Mr Fraser submitted that a more significant appeal avenue was that which appears to have been available to the Crown if it wished to contend error in the s.39 order, being a Crown appeal against sentence under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912, given the definition of ""Sentence"" in s.2(1) of that Act as including a s.39 order. It was submitted that the Crown could have appealed against the order of 26 September 2011, but instead effectively agreed with it when the matter was relisted in the District Court on 16 December 2011.

Decision

83The issue before the Court is one of statutory construction. The construction of s.39 commences with a consideration of the text itself, with regard to context, including the general purpose and policy of the provision and the mischief it is seeking to remedy: Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Limited v Commissioner of Territory Revenue [2009] HCA 41; 239 CLR 27 at 46-47 [47]. Context is to be understood in its widest sense, including the statutory scheme governing the Forensic Division of the Tribunal in Part 5 MHFP Act and the provision for appellate review contained in s.77A: CIC Insurance Limited v Bankstown Football Club Limited [1997] HCA 2; 187 CLR 384 at 408; Network Ten Pty Limited v TCN Channel Nine Pty Limited [2004] HCA 14; 218 CLR 273 at 280-281 [11]-[13]. As mentioned above (at [44]), an understanding of legislative history will also assist the process of construction.

84There is no express provision in s.39 for a court to place a time limit for the operation of conditional release. This is significant, given that elsewhere in the same Act, there lies an express limiting term power under ss.23-24 MHFP Act following a special hearing. 

85The textual analysis of s.39 does not support a construction that would see a court being entitled to set a binding final period as part of any conditional release. Indeed, although the Attorney General did not contend that there was an absence of power to fix a time at all, the better view may be that this is the case. Given the statutory requirement under s.44 for an early review by the Tribunal of a forensic patient, such as X, no real purpose would be served by the setting of a time by the Court beyond a form of recommendation or suggestion.

86However, as a submission to this effect was not advanced before me, it is not appropriate to express any concluded view on this issue. It is sufficient to note the absence of such a provision in s.39 and the presence elsewhere in the same Act of a time-fixing power in ss.23-24. This is an important factor in the construction of s.39.

87Section 39 arises for consideration following acquittal. Legally, the person is not to blame for his or her actions and is not to be punished for them: R v SE [2009] NSWSC 785 at [67] (Hoeben J).

88The purpose of the imposition of conditions of release under s.39 contains no element of punishment, with the aim of the exercise being the protection of others and the community generally, together with the welfare of the person concerned: R v Line [2004] NSWSC 1148 at [17] (Simpson J); R v Shan Shan Xu [No. 2] [2005] NSWSC 70 at [53] (Kirby J). 

89The rationale underlying s.39 was described by Penfold J, in the course of a helpful examination of relevant statutory schemes in the Australian Capital Territory and other Australian jurisdictions, in R v Steurer [2009] ACTSC 150; 30 ACTLR 272 at 296 [98]-[99]:

""[98] ... The focus is not on blame or punishment (actual or estimated) (see Hoeben J in R v SE, quoted at [31] above), but on ensuring the safety of the community and the accused. The requirements for ensuring community safety are not seen as bearing any necessary relationship to the gravity of the accused's actions, let alone to the gravity of those actions in the hypothetical case of the actions having taken place in the absence of mental illness.

[99] The logic of the NSW approach seems to be that a person who continues to be a serious danger to him or herself or to the community may need to be detained for longer than would be justified by the offence if committed by a person who is not mentally impaired. The NSW arrangements give full discretion in how long such a person is detained to the Mental Health Review Tribunal; the requirement that the Tribunal must be headed for that purpose by a Judge or former Judge of the NSW Supreme Court presumably reflects a view that the requirements of justice must be observed in administering the person's detention. If the detention is related to the need for community safety (or the person's own safety), then the fact that the NSW approach may mean that a person is detained for longer than would be justified by the nature of his or her 'offending' behaviour is beside the point. Indeed, it is possible that such a person might have been compulsorily detained under mental health arrangements even where there had been no offending behaviour.

90The general tenor of her Honour's observations are apt to the resolution of the present proceedings, particularly with respect to the irrelevance of any concept of proportionality.

91I do not consider that the sentencing principle of proportionality has any role to play in the making of an order under s.39 MHFP Act. The power to make an order under s.39 is effectively protective and not punitive, so that this factor ought play no part: cf State of New South Wales v Tillman [2008] NSWSC 1293 at [57]-[61]. 

92To construe the general terms of s.39 as accommodating considerations external to that provision, such as sentencing factors (including proportionality), would be inconsistent with principles of statutory interpretation that when the legislature explicitly gives a power by a particular provision which prescribes the mode in which it shall be exercised, it excludes the operation of general expressions in the same statute which might otherwise have been relied upon for the same power: Pearce and Geddes, ""Statutory Interpretation in Australia"", 7th edn, 2011, LexisNexis Butterworths, paragraph [4.34].

93It is clear, and not in dispute, that X became a forensic patient when the conditional release order was made on 26 September 2011. Of necessity, any conditions set by the Judge on 26 September 2011 would relate to the state of affairs as it then existed which, of course, was capable of change. To adopt a construction which would see the Tribunal having clear and full power to impose an entirely new set of conditions, based upon the material before the Tribunal, but with a fixed temporal outer limit determined by the Judge, would not promote the purpose or object of s.39 and Part 5 MHFP Act: s.33 Interpretation Act 1987.

94As Simpson J observed in R v Line at [18]:

""Of course, the nature of her condition is such that the insight she has at present may, temporarily or otherwise, be lost. It is for that reason that the legislature has provided that persons in her position are subject to the overriding supervision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. I understand that the conditions proposed are essentially drawn from those commonly used by that Tribunal. They are comprehensive and detailed and, I am satisfied, adequate for their purpose.""

95It is significant that the MHFP Act entrusts the care and treatment of forensic patients to the Forensic Division of the Tribunal, a specialist statutory body charged with important responsibilities in this respect. The attributes of the Tribunal as a specialist statutory body were considered and emphasised in A by his Tutor Brett Anthony Collins v Mental Health Review Tribunal at [56]-[59]. 

96Importantly, since 2009, there are provisions for appeal against decisions of the Tribunal under s.77A MHFP Act which permit a forensic patient (as well as the Minister for Health or the Attorney General in certain cases) to challenge a decision of the Tribunal. 

97The contemporary statutory scheme, which sets out the functions and powers of the Tribunal, subject to statutory appeal to this Court or the Court of Appeal, is far removed from the past position which saw a person found not guilty by reason of mental illness being detained, subject to the exercise of executive power by the Governor, with the Tribunal playing a recommendation-making role only. 

98To construe s.39 as permitting a court, based upon such limited material as may then be available, to fix a legally binding period as an outer limit for the Tribunal to exercise its functions under Part 5, does not sit comfortably with the statutory scheme and would, to my mind, operate adversely to it.

99The strongest argument in favour of a time-limiting power of the Court under s.39 emerges from s.51 MHFP Act. That provision is not worded ideally. Section 51 was referred to during the short argument which took place in the District Court on 26 September 2011 in support of the power to set a time limit. In the seventh review decision of the Tribunal of 30 July 2013, a different construction of s.51 was adopted by the Tribunal. 

100The heading to s.51 states ""Termination of Classification as Forensic Patient on Unconditional Release"". Although not forming part of the MHFP Act, the heading of a section is available extrinsic material which may assist in ascertaining the meaning of the provision: s.35(2), (5) Interpretation Act 1987; Pelechowski v Registrar, Court of Appeal [1999] HCA 19; 198 CLR 435 at 448-449 [40]; Aoun Investments Pty Limited v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue [2006] NSWSC 1394; 65 ATR 301 at [26]-[27].

101It must be borne in mind that if a person is released unconditionally under s.39 by order of the Court, the person does not become a forensic patient in the first place: s.42(1) MHFP Act. Accordingly, s.51 must be taken to operate in other circumstances. 

102In its decision of 30 July 2013, the Tribunal expressed the view that s.51(1)(b) is aimed at a situation where, having determined to unconditionally release someone, a court or the Tribunal nevertheless imposed a condition precedent to that unconditional release coming into effect, such as arrangements for repatriation or deportation to be completed in the case of a forensic patient who is a foreign national. Such a construction would give effect to the section. One can understand this scenario as a possible example of a situation where the provision could operate in this way. However, I do not construe s.51 as being confined to such a situation.

103I accept the submission of the Attorney General that s.51(1) is predicated on the person being a forensic patient before the court order releasing the person is made. The language of the section only accommodates orders by a court with respect to persons who are already forensic patients. It does not accommodate time-limited orders by a court under s.39 conditionally releasing a person, where it was that order that made the person a forensic patient in the first place. An ordinary reading of the syntax of s.51(1)(b) is such that the order which makes a person a forensic patient, and the order that unconditionally releases the person after the expiration of a prescribed time period, will be temporally distinct. Even if there is scope for an unconditional release order under s.39 to engage s.51(1)(a) (which I do not accept), s.51(1)(b) does not accommodate a time-limited conditional release order made under s.39 where the person only became a forensic patient by reason of that order.

104I am satisfied that a construction that would see s.51(1)(b) permitting a time-limited order of the type made in the District Court would not be consistent with the object and purpose of the MHFP Act. 

105I accept the submission of the Attorney General that the appropriate construction is to construe the words ""order of a court"" in s.51(1)(a) as being a reference to an order made under s.77A(9)(a) MHFP Act, and not s.39(1). Such an interpretation is consistent with the 2008 amendments to the legislation, which inserted that phrase into s.51(1)(a), having simultaneously inserted the appeal provision contained in s.77A into the MHFP Act, but not having otherwise amended s.39. 

106That interpretation is also reflected in the sequence in s.51(1)(a), with an order of the court being secondary or subsequent to an order of the Tribunal, keeping in mind that a s.39 order precedes any order by the Tribunal under Part 5 MHFP Act.

107I accept the submission of the Attorney General that this construction, which allows s.51(1) to apply to a court order under s.77A(9)(a) but not under s.39, promotes the underlying purpose or object of Part 5, in particular, that a forensic patient not be released until the Tribunal (or the Supreme Court on appeal) is satisfied that the safety of the patient, or any member of the public, will not be seriously endangered by the patient's release. 

108For these reasons, I accept the construction and operation of s.39 advanced by the Attorney General referred to at [63], [71] and [73] above. 

109I acknowledge that policy arguments exist, as advanced by Mr Fraser and referred to at [78]-[79] above. However, it is a matter for the legislature to determine the powers and functions of the courts and the Tribunal in the areas to which the MHFP Act applies. The Attorney General drew to the Court's attention Report 138 of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, ""People With Cognitive and Mental Health Impairments in the Criminal Justice System - Criminal Responsibility and Consequences"", (May 2013). 

110It is, of course, a matter for government to determine whether amendments ought be made to the MHFP Act, no doubt having considered Report 138 and the recommendations contained in it. 

111The task of the Court is to construe the MHFP Act in accordance with relevant principles of statutory construction. Having undertaken that task, I am satisfied that the Attorney General has demonstrated a prima facie entitlement to declarations as sought in the Summons.

Declaratory Relief

112The Court has jurisdiction to make binding declarations of right in proceedings before it, whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed: s.75 Supreme Court Act 1970.

113The Court has a broad jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief: Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Limited [1972] HCA 61;127 CLR 421 at 435.

114Appropriately, Mr Kell referred the Court to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Higginson [2011] NSWCA 151, where statements were made which may be seen to operate against the grant of declaratory relief in this case. Young JA, at [87]ff, observed that generally speaking, courts do not, as a matter of discretion, make a declaration which conflicts with the determination of inferior courts, particularly in criminal matters. Young JA observed, at [90], that, although there is no utility in granting a declaration as to the sentence of a court as such a declaration cannot affect the binding effect of the sentence as pronounced, it is a different matter if there is some doubt as to the applicability of legislation which, for example, provided for remission of sentence on the original sentence. In my view, the present case is analogous to the class of case where there is utility in granting declaratory relief.

115There is some analogy with the use of declaratory relief to determine a question of statutory construction, the resolution of which affected the date when a prisoner should be released from gaol: Cheetham v McGeechan [1971] 2 NSWLR 222 at 224.

116I accept that there is utility in the declaratory relief sought in the Summons and that a concrete issue is raised that is currently of real practical importance: Edwards v Santos Limited [2011] HCA 8; 242 CLR 421 at 436 [38].

117I accept the submission of the Attorney General that, given the divergent approaches evidenced by the District Court and the Tribunal, it is appropriate that the status of X be clarified by a superior court. It is equally appropriate and desirable that there be no continuing uncertainty as to whether or not the Tribunal will have jurisdiction in relation to X after 25 September 2013. 

118I have taken into account, in the exercise of discretion, the fact that the Crown authorities considered it appropriate to approach the Judge on 6 December 2011, but then accepted the terms and effect of the s.39 order made on 26 September 2011. Further, the Crown did not appeal against the s.39 order to the Court of Criminal Appeal, despite the apparent ability to do so, assuming that a Crown appeal could have been brought under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

119Rather, at a time close to 25 September 2013, the Attorney General has approached this Court for relief. 

120I have no doubt that the matters referred to in the preceding paragraphs are relevant to the exercise of discretion whether to grant declaratory relief. I bear in mind, however, that it did not become clear until recently that X would be subject to Tribunal conditions and remain a forensic patient after 25 September 2013. It was possible until then that any proceedings would have been academic. 

121I have reached a clear view concerning the proper construction and operation of the MHFP Act and that view is entirely inconsistent with a legal conclusion that would see the Tribunal's power with respect to X ceasing on 25 September 2013. I have had regard, as well, to the detailed material before the Court arising from the regular reviews undertaken by the Tribunal, utilising its expertise, with respect to the necessary care and treatment of X. I have in mind, as well, that it remains open to X, in the future, to exercise his appellate rights under s.77A MHFP Act if he sees fit.

122In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that it is appropriate, in the exercise of discretion, to grant the relief sought by the Attorney General. 

Orders

123I make the following orders:

(a) the Court:

(i) declares that the decision of the Mental Health Review Tribunal (""the Tribunal"") dated 30 July 2013, made following a forensic review of X on 25 June 2013 under s.46(1) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act"") is valid,

(ii) declares that the order for variation to conditional release made by the Tribunal under the Act in relation to X on 19 December 2012, the continued application of which was noted in the Tribunal decision of 30 July 2013, has, and will continue after 25 September 2013 to have, full force and effect according to its tenor,

(iii) declares that the order made on 26 September 2011 by the District Court of New South Wales under s.39 of the Act (""the District Court order"") does not limit the time period during which the conditional release order of 19 December 2012, or any further order made by the Tribunal varying or substituting that order, has or will have operative effect,

(iv) declares that the District Court order does not have the effect that, after 25 September 2013, X will cease to be a forensic patient under the Act.

(b) I make no order as to costs.

		20 September 2013",2013-09-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706108,R v Abbas [2013] NSWSC 1379,"Judgment on sentence
1On 23 July 2013 the offender, Khaldoun Abbas, was arraigned in this Court on an indictment that contained three counts.  He pleaded guilty to all three charges. The first count charged him with the manslaughter of Hassan Saleh on 6 August 2011. The second count charged him with assaulting Jui Wei Huang (""Huang"") on 6 August 2011 while in company and occasioning him actual bodily harm contrary to s 59(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.  The third count charged him with possessing a prohibited pistol on 6 August 2011 without a licence or permit contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996.
2The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years (Crimes Act, s 24).  The maximum penalty for the offence under s 59(2) of the Crimes Act is seven years imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for the firearms offence is fourteen years imprisonment.
3Of these offences only the firearms offence carries a standard non parole period prescribed by s 54A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the ""Sentencing Act""), being three years.   In sentencing Mr Abbas for that offence, I am required to be mindful of the two legislative guideposts constituted by the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period (Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]).
4However, the Sentencing Act does not require me to undertake that exercise by treating the non-parole period as the necessary starting point or the only important end point in fixing the sentence (Muldrock at [17]). Nor am I required to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period in this case (Muldrock at [25]). Instead, I am required to bear in mind those two legislative guideposts. I am required to identify all the factors relevant to the sentence, discuss their significance and then assess the appropriate sentence (Muldrock at [26], citing McHugh J in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [51]).  As I will explain, in this case one matter that significantly affects the punishment imposed for the firearms offence is the need to avoid double punishment for the elements of that offence that are common to the other two offences on the indictment.  This consideration significantly reduces the significance of the non-parole period in this case.
5In addition to the three charges on the indictment, Mr Abbas has requested that in sentencing him for the offence of manslaughter the Court take into account a Form 1 offence in the manner provided for in s 33(1) of the Sentencing Act, namely an offence of possessing ammunition without being the holder of an appropriate licence or permit, or being authorised to possess it, contrary to s 65(3) of the Firearms Act.
6The manner in which Form 1 offences are to be taken into account was discussed in Re Attorney General's Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 and Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115.  A Form 1 offence can be taken into account as part of the process of instinctive synthesis by demonstrating a greater need for personal deterrence and retribution for the principal offence (Abbas at [22] to [23] per Bathurst CJ).
The agreed facts
7The circumstances surrounding the offences were set out in an agreed statement of facts. The agreed statement was the outcome of discussions between the very experienced counsel who appeared on behalf of the Crown and the offender.  The following is taken from those facts.
8The victim of the second count, Huang, was a drug dealer and drug addict. Sometime prior to 6 August 2011 he purchased drugs from the offender.  He owed the offender $500 from that purchase. He avoided contact with the offender who was seeking recovery of the amount owing.
9On 6 August 2011, Erin Cincotta (""Cincotta"") contacted Huang and told him that she was able to pay  him  some money she owed.  Huang arranged to go to her home in Rockdale later that day to collect the money.  At around 10:00am that day the offender visited Cincotta at her home looking for Huang.  She told him that she was due to meet Huang.  The offender asked her to let him know when she saw Huang.
10Later that afternoon, Cincotta again spoke to the offender.  She told him that Huang was coming to her house later that day.  The agreed facts describe the offender as being angry that Huang had not paid him.  He said words to the effect of:  ""I'm going to slap him over the head when I see him"".  He motioned with his hand as he said this, indicating a slapping gesture.
11Some time in the afternoon the offender made contact with his friend Aydin Taycan Dogan (""Dogan"").  The offender told Dogan that Huang owed him $500 and that they were going to collect this money.  They looked for Huang in the Rockdale area. 
12The deceased, Hassan Saleh, was a friend of the offender, Dogan and Cincotta.  Shortly before 4:00pm, he arrived at Cincotta's home. Although it was not expressly stated in the agreed facts, the inference is overwhelming that the offender had contacted the deceased and he was looking for Huang.  He stayed for a short period and left. The offender also visited Cincotta's home that afternoon enquiring as to the whereabouts of Huang. He left when he was told that Huang was not there but would be arriving later.
13At around 6:30pm Huang was walking towards Cincotta's house.  As he approached, he telephoned the offender and told him that he was obtaining some money.  He offered to pay part of what he owed immediately and the rest later.  He arranged to meet the offender at the home of Huang's ex-girlfriend in an hour.  Huang arrived at Cincotta's home at about 6.50pm.  He was carrying some packages of drugs and a set of scales.  Cincotta let Huang into the house through the front door and then locked it.  Huang sat down on the couch in the lounge.
14A short time later, the deceased arrived at the back door of the house. Cincotta answered the door.  The deceased asked her if Huang was inside.  Cincotta said he was and let the deceased into the house.  The deceased went into the lounge room and sat to the right of Huang on a separate chair.  Huang did not know the deceased.  He assumed that he was a friend of Cincotta who had come to pay her a visit.  About five minutes later Dogan arrived at the house.  He went into the lounge room as well.
15Soon after, the offender arrived at the house and went to the lounge  room. Huang got up to shake his hand but, before he could do so, Dogan grabbed him around the neck and the deceased grabbed him around the feet.  They put him down onto the floor on his back.  As he was lying on the floor, Huang was restrained by Dogan, who was behind him with his arm held tightly around Huang's neck, and by the deceased, who was holding him down by his feet.  The offender asked Huang if he had the money.  Huang replied:  ""No"".
16The offender then started hitting Huang on his face using his left and right hands.  He then pulled out a pouch from the pocket of his clothing and started to hit Huang with the pouch.  The pouch contained some form of hard object which I infer was the pistol the subject of the third count.  As a result of this assault, Huang sustained a large bruise and significant swelling to his head and facial area.  The outer layer of skin on his forehead was broken.  Huang suffered redness and swelling around the area of his left eye.
17The offender then reached into the pouch and pulled out a pistol.  He pointed it in the direction of Huang's legs while Huang was lying on the floor.  He told Huang to get up.  Dogan then released his grip on Huang's neck. The deceased was trying to help Huang get up.  At this time, the deceased was facing Huang and lifting him up with his hands on Huang's hips.  The offender then walked behind Huang and the gun discharged.  Huang did not see how the gun discharged.  Dogan's evidence at the committal hearing was that he did not see the gun discharge on the first occasion and that he did not see the gun at all until it discharged for a second time on the ground.  Huang was standing facing the deceased when the gun discharged.
18The bullet passed through the deceased's left cheek and lodged in his brain.  The deceased fell down.  The offender dropped the gun onto the floor.  When he went to pick it up it discharged again. The agreed facts record that the police crime scene officer located a bullet hole in the skirting board and the bullet from the second discharge which had ricocheted off the skirting board into the carpet.  It appeared that this second shot had travelled parallel to the floor into the skirting board, consistent with a misfire at the time the offender was retrieving the gun from the floor.
19The offender left the scene, taking the pistol with him. The pistol has never been recovered.  One fired cartridge case was recovered in the area where the deceased fell down.  An analysis of that cartridge case indicates that the pistol was a semi-automatic firearm (ie it did not require manual ejection of the spent cartridge and manual reloading for it to fire for a second time).  Both bullets were later recovered and it was determined that they were .22 calibre ammunition.  The description of the firearm and the  offender's plea to the third count establishes that the gun was a prohibited pistol.  The offender  did not have a licence or permit to keep or possess any type of firearm, pistol or ammunition.
20The deceased was taken from the scene by ambulance officers to the St George Hospital.  He was maintained on a ventilator until he was declared dead at 3:00pm on 7 August 2011.
21An autopsy confirmed the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.  As stated, the entry point of the gunshot wound was the deceased's left cheek.  No burning of the skin or soot on the surface of the skin was identified, however it was noted that there was a ""faint stippling of the skin of the cheek"" near the entry wound.  ""Stippling"" refers to marks left on the skin by small fragments of metal coming out of the weapon when it is fired.  This indicates that the gun discharged at close range to the deceased's face.
22In the opinion of the doctor who performed the autopsy, the gun discharged somewhere between a matter of a few inches to one or two feet from the deceased's face.  The angle of the bullet was approximately 45 degrees to the transverse plane.
The offences
23The agreed basis for the entry of a plea of guilty to manslaughter was the commission by the offender of an unlawful and dangerous act causing death, namely the act of brandishing a firearm in a dangerous and threatening manner at close range to the persons present at the scene.  The offender is not being sentenced on the basis that he intentionally discharged a firearm or that he intended to cause death or inflict grievous bodily harm via the use of a pistol on anyone present at the scene.  If that had been established then the offender would have been guilty of murder, even if the person he intended to harm or kill was Huang and not the deceased.  As I understand the position, it was the inability of the Crown to prove the intentional discharge of the pistol that led to it accepting the plea to manslaughter.
24As noted by Senior Counsel for the offender, Mr Stratton SC, the accidental discharge of the gun is supported by the fact that the victim was the offender's friend.  The Crown Prosecutor fairly conceded that the angle of discharge of the pistol does not support any suggestion that the victim found himself in the path of a shot fired intentionally by the offender at Huang.  The accidental nature of the discharge is also supported by the gun discharging when the offender sought to retrieve it from the floor.
25The offender did not give evidence before me and therefore there is no direct evidence as to the precise manner of the discharge of the weapon. However a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Olav Nielssen, that was tendered on his behalf records the following:
""[The offender] confirmed that he and [the deceased] were attempting to collect money owed to them by [Huang].  He said that he was holding the gun pointing towards [Huang's] leg, and slapping him with the other hand. He said there was a struggle, and his coaccused Dogan bumped him over and as he was falling the gun went off.""
26Ordinarily I would afford little weight to such hearsay in resolving contested matters of fact.  However this version is entirely consistent with the agreed facts.  It neither lessens nor increases the seriousness of the offender's conduct.  I accept this description of how the gun discharged.
27A more controversial aspect of the history as recorded in Dr Nielssen's report was the following:
""[The offender] said that it was a 'tiny gun', which he confirmed was a .22 calibre pistol, and he did not know if it had a safety catch.  He said 'I didn't even know that it was loaded'.  He said 'when we took it we used to take turns ... I never really held it  with me much'."" (emphasis added)
28The Crown took issue with the assertions in this account that the offender did not know that the pistol was loaded (or had a safety catch).  It submitted that the admission by the offender of the offence of possessing ammunition as listed on the ""Form 1"" was inconsistent with this assertion. The definitions of ""possession"" found in ss 4 and 4A of the Firearms Act only relate to firearms and not ammunition, so that the common law concept of possession is apposite.  It requires knowledge of the presence of the item by the possessor (He Kaw Teh v R [1985] HCA 43; 157 CLR 523).
29The agreed facts are silent on whether the offender knew the gun was loaded.  They do not identify what precise acts constitute the offence listed on the Form 1, so that it is not clear whether the ammunition the subject of that offence was that contained in the pistol or was on the offender's person.  In the absence of that being made clear, I will not proceed on the basis that it has been established that he knew the pistol was loaded, but equally I will not accept the positive assertion of an absence of knowledge either. Further, I will not proceed upon an acceptance of the other matters suggested by the above extract from the psychiatrist's report, namely that the pistol was something passed around between the offender and others or that the offender did not carry it with him often.
30For the purposes of characterising the seriousness of this manslaughter, these matters are of little moment.  Irrespective of them, and while I would not place this offence into the worst category, it is undoubtedly a very serious example of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. Of all crimes, manslaughter is said to ""thro[w] up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability"" (R v Blacklidge, Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, 12 December 1995, unreported).  Even within the categories of manslaughter, such as unlawful and dangerous act or excessive self defence, the range of circumstances is ""notoriously wide"" and an offence in one category is not necessarily better or worse than one in another (Berrier v R [2009] NSWCCA 40 at [25]).  Nevertheless the starting point is that manslaughter involves the unlawful taking of a human life and there must be an assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the offence (Blacklidge id).  In this case, the offender recruited two associates, including the deceased, to help him severely beat someone to recover a drug debt. While doing so he brandished a pistol to induce the victim of the beating to believe he would or might be shot.  If it is sensible to speak of a range of manslaughters, then this offence is at the high end of that range.
31The second count on the indictment concerns the beating administered to Huang by the offender in company with Dogan and the deceased.  The offender was the organiser of the beating and the one who administered the blows.  He used his fist and a weapon, namely the pistol.  Again this was a very serious form of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and falls in the upper end of the range of objective seriousness encompassed by this offence.  It was premeditated.  It was undertaken for the purpose of recovering a drug debt.  The bruising suffered by Huang to his face was substantial and must have involved significant pain.
32Similarly the circumstances surrounding the firearms offence place it in the higher range of objective seriousness for this category of offence.  To possess and take a prohibited pistol to an organised beating to recover a drug debt is very serious criminal conduct.  The social evil of possessing a prohibited pistol is recognised by the offence created by s 7(1) of the Firearms Act and is reinforced by the prescription of a substantial standard non-parole period for the offence.  As explained below, a heavily reduced sentence for this offence is warranted in this case, but only in order to avoid the offender being doubly punished.  This consequence does not flow from any assessment that the firearms offence was not serious.
Victim impact 
33At the time of his death Hassan Saleh was eighteen years of age.  He was the youngest in a family of eight children.  Victim impact statements were provided to the Court by a number of his siblings, including Jihad, Mohammad, Ibtisam, Houda, Zeinab and Saleh.  With the consent of the offender, a statement was also provided by Hassan's niece, Mariam Saleh. She is close to him in age.  Both Zeinab and Saleh Saleh read their victim impact statements. Their impact was powerful and their emotions were raw.
34All of the statements speak fondly of a young man for whom family appears to have been everything and who, as a consequence, had much to live for.  His niece described him as great fun.  Saleh Saleh described his younger brother as a hard worker. Some of the authors express regret that they did not do something that would have prevented him being where he was on the evening of 6 August 2011.  Such regrets are understandable but of course the fault for his death does not lie with them but with the offender.
35In his statement Jihad Saleh explains that he invited all his brothers and sisters to his house on the evening of 6 August 2011 for a feast for Ramadan and to celebrate his son's birthday.  Instead the evening ended with the siblings assembling at St George Hospital with their brother on life support.  To them fell the task of telephoning their parents, who were overseas in Lebanon on holidays.  They flew home urgently.  If their return journey was not enough of an ordeal, on their arrival what must they have felt when they saw their son at the hospital and discussed his fate with the doctors?
36All of the statements reveal the ongoing regret, grief and anxiety suffered by the family. Hassan's brother, Saleh Saleh, did not strike me as a particularly emotional man, yet his ongoing pain was evident when he delivered his statement.  Many of Hassan's siblings now have families of their own.  It is clear that whenever this large but close family assembles their thoughts will soon turn to the brother who is missing, the son who never had a family of his own.
37The significance of victim impact statements was discussed in MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226 at [61] to [63] per Grove J, with Hidden and Kirby JJ agreeing.  I am not to treat them as evidence which I can act on, or material which operates in aggravation of the offence, or as otherwise adverse to the offender. Nevertheless, the Court acknowledges the profound loss to Hassan Saleh's family caused by his death at the hands of the offender.
Offender's personal history
38The offender was born in September 1992.  As at the date of the offence he was eighteen years of age.  He is now twenty-one.
39Tendered on the offender's behalf was a statement from his mother, Naziha Arab.  The offender is the second oldest of her four children.  She explained that she left the offender's father when he was three years old to escape domestic violence.  She struggled to raise her children while working in part time jobs.  She said that the offender had difficulties at school and left at the end of year 9.  He tried to find work as a labourer but was unsuccessful.
40Since 2009 the offender has been in a relationship with Ms Elle Xippas.  She describes herself and the offender as married in the Muslim faith and says they will formalise their marriage ""at law"" when he is released from gaol. She states that the offender has never been violent or aggressive towards her.  The offender and Ms Xippas have a daughter who is now aged nineteen months.  She was born after the offender was taken into custody.
41Ms Xippas records that after she and the offender had been seeing each other for a few months she learnt about the offender's ""drug problem"".  His mother states that she did not become aware of it until after he was arrested.  The offender's drug usage was addressed in Dr Nielssen's report.  Dr Nielssen reports the offender stating that he commenced smoking cannabis at age fourteen and methylamphetamines from age sixteen. He also recorded him as having taken ecstasy, heroin and benzodiazepine medication.  Dr Nielssen reported him as having been drug free since he was incarcerated.  Dr Nielssen diagnosed the offender as having ""substance use disorder"", based on his past drug usage and disrupted personal history.  This was said to be in remission.  He also diagnosed him as having ""dysthymic disorder"" which is said to be based on his ""history of chronic low grade depressive illness"" that was not so severe that he was unable to perform ""usual social roles or [meant that he was] brought ... to the attention of mental health services in prison"".
42At this point I note the following concerning the offender's personal circumstances.
43First, prior to these offences the only previous convictions of the offender were in July 2010 for producing a licence altered in a manner calculated to deceive (ie a ""fake I.D.""), and possession of a prohibited drug.  He received small fines for these offences.  Ordinarily this record would result in him being sentenced on the basis that he was a person of prior good character.  That said, the circumstances of this offence suggest that little significance can be attached to that record.  They do not suggest his presence at the scene on 6 August 2011 was accidental or out of character. To the contrary, the offender orchestrated a beating designed to obtain repayment of a drug debt.  One incident has been recorded on his prison record since he was arrested, but otherwise his behaviour in prison is a matter in his favour.
44Second, the offender's reported history of drug usage casts little light on the circumstances surrounding the offences. I accept the evidence that I have summarised concerning the offender's drug habit and his drug free status since he was arrested. There is a  brief comment in Dr Nielssen's report that the offender may have been mildly affected by drugs on 6 August 2011, but I attach little weight to that statement.  Even if I had accepted it, it would not be a mitigating circumstance (R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [206]).  In any event, the offender's conduct as revealed by the agreed facts relates to his status as a drug dealer, not as a drug user, albeit most likely on a small scale. Nevertheless his continuing drug free status is a matter that warrants greater confidence in his prospects of rehabilitation.
45Third, Dr Nielssen's description of him suffering a low grade depressive illness is not particularly surprising given that he is facing a significant period in custody.  It is also consistent with his ongoing grief over his role in his friend's death, a matter I will address.
46Fourth, one matter to note is the impact of the offender's incarceration on his daughter and his partner.  I am bound by authority to only take into account the hardship occasioned to them from his incarceration if exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated (see R v Macleod [2013] NSWCCA 108 at [43]).  The enforced separation of a father from a young mother and their daughter is a circumstance of significant hardship, but it does not rise to the level of exceptional circumstances.  His daughter has never known a father who is out of gaol.  The offender will miss out on some important years of her development, however he will be released in time to still play a significant role in her upbringing.  Leaving aside hardship, his ongoing connection to his partner and daughter is a factor that operates in his favour in assessing his prospects of rehabilitation.
47Fifth, I assess the offender as having good prospects of rehabilitation. I have already described the seriousness of the offences.  However it must be remembered that he was eighteen at the time they were committed.  It has led to him being incarcerated for the first time and for what will be a relatively lengthy period.  As discussed next, I accept that his grief and remorse are genuine.  He embarked upon an escapade of gangsterism and ended up killing his friend.  He will watch his daughter grow up without him.  I expect that these matters more than anything else will give him insight.
Plea and remorse
48The offence was committed on 6 August 2011.  The offender was arrested on 15 August 2011.  He was not committed for trial until 11 October 2012.  It was agreed that, by a letter to the prosecution dated 6 December 2011, his solicitor stated that he was prepared to plead guilty to manslaughter.  Thus this offer was made four months after he was arrested and over nine months before he was committed for trial. The offer to plead guilty to the offence of manslaughter was initially rejected by the Crown and that rejection was maintained until just prior to his entry of a plea on 23 July 2013.
49Allowing for a proper opportunity to review the Crown brief and obtaining considered legal advice, in my view this represents the proffer of a plea at the earliest opportunity that was reasonably available.  I consider that it warrants a discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea of 25% (R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383).
50It is appropriate at this point to address the evidence of the offender's remorse.  Dr Nielssen's report records the offender's desire to ""try to apologise"" to the deceased' s family.  Tendered at the hearing was a letter addressed to the Court written by the offender.  In his letter he described his feelings of pain and depression ""at losing my childhood best friend Hassan Saleh"". He states that he ""can[not] imagine what his family are going through"". He states that he has tried to make contact with the deceased's family through his own family and friends, but he has not been successful.  He also states that he has made attempts to apologise to Huang ""as [I am] sure my actions have caused him a lifetime of painful memories which [I am] sure will [affect] him as they are [affecting] me"".  Also tendered on behalf of the offender were various prison records that contained observations made by prison staff that he was experiencing significant grief at the loss of his friend.  Both the offender's mother and Ms Xippas testify to the offender's grief and remorse at the loss of his friend as a result of his conduct.
51I accept that the offender grieves for the loss of his friend and is remorseful over his role in his death. There is no doubt that they were friends. The discharge of the gun was accidental and every circumstance of the offence overwhelmingly points against him wishing the deceased any harm.  However, I am not convinced that he feels any remorse towards Huang. He planned to beat him to extract a drug debt and carried through with his intention.  His reflections on the offence and his conduct towards Huang are most likely coloured by the knowledge that his actions resulted in the death of his friend rather than their adverse effect upon Huang. 
Aggravating and mitigating factors
52Sub-section 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act lists a series of aggravating factors that the Court is to take into account in determining the appropriate sentence.  These factors cannot be considered as aggravating the offence if they are elements of the offence.  Sub-section 21A(3) lists a series of mitigating factors.
53The Crown Prosecutor submitted that a number of aggravating factors were present. The first was that the manslaughter and assault offences involved the use of a weapon (s 21(2)(c)).  I accept that this is so.  Both the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Stratton SC accepted that the preferable approach was to identify the use of the weapon as an aggravating factor, but then ensure that double punishment was not imposed in relation to the firearms offence.  I address below the potential for overlap between the reliance on this aggravating factor and the imposition of a separate sentence for the firearms offence.
54Second, it was submitted that the offence(s) were committed in the home of the ""victim or any other person"", presumably being Cincotta (s 21(2)(eb)). I accept that this is so although I afford this factor little weight.  The agreed facts do not state that Cincotta was unaware that her home was to be used as a location to extort money from Mr Huang by force.  To the contrary, some of the matters stated in the agreed facts suggest that she may have been aware.
55A number of mitigating factors are also present which I have already discussed, namely the absence of any significant record of previous convictions and his character (ss 21(3)(e) and (f)), the offender's likelihood of re-offending and prospects of rehabilitation (ss 21(3)(g) and (h)), his remorse over the death of the deceased which has been established by evidence and acknowledgement of the loss he has caused (s 21(3)(i)), and his plea of guilty (s 21(3)(k)).
Concurrency and accumulation
56It is apparent from the above analysis of the three offences that there is a significant potential for overlap between the facts and circumstances surrounding each of the three offences. 
57The starting point for the imposition of an appropriate sentence is the necessity to ""fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as totality"" (Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [45]).  However, the decision in Pearce illustrates that, even at the first stage of considering the appropriate penalty for each individual offence, care must be taken to ensure that an offender is not subject to double punishment for some element common to two or more offences and that is not overcome by making the sentences concurrent (Pearce at [49];  Portolesi v R [2012]  NSWCCA 157 at [45]).
58Thus in Pearce the offender was charged with two offences each of which had as an element the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon the same victim.  Significant sentences were imposed for each of the offences.  The High Court found that each of these sentences contained a portion of punishment for the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon the victim and this constituted a form of double punishment (at [40] to [43] and [49] per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ, Gummow J agreeing at [69], contra Kirby J at [132]). 
59As noted, the ""brandishing"" of the pistol by the offender was the act that constituted the unlawful and dangerous act.  The offender also used the pistol to assault Huang.  It is accepted that it was an aggravating feature of each of those offences that a weapon was ""used"".  All of these matters encompass the offender's conduct in ""possessing"" the pistol, which is an element of the offence under s 7(1) of the Firearms Act. If a separate and substantial penalty was to be imposed for that offence, then it would amount to a form of double punishment for the element of possessing a firearm and that cannot be addressed by making the sentence wholly concurrent (Pearce at [49];  Portolesi at [52]).  Accordingly, consistent with Pearce, I propose to impose a significantly reduced penalty for that offence to accommodate the punishment for the other two offences which necessarily reflects the offender's conduct in possessing the pistol. 
60The second stage of the sentencing process noted in Pearce at [45] is to consider ""questions of cumulation or concurrency, as well, of course, as totality"". Thus care needs to be taken in imposing a penalty for each offence and structuring the overall sentence to ensure that the combined effect of all the sentences reflects the total criminality of the offender's conduct (see Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] per Howie J). 
61I consider that the sentences for the manslaughter offence and the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence should be partly accumulated. They were logically distinct crimes with no overlapping elements.  There were separate victims.  However they arose out of the one criminal escapade and occurred within minutes of each other.
62Otherwise in determining the sentence for the manslaughter offence I have taken into account the offence of possess ammunition listed on the Form 1.  However, in the absence of any facts concerning the Form 1 offence, there is nothing before the Court to suggest that any additional punishment for the offence of manslaughter is warranted by that offence.
63Finally, I note that no submissions were made concerning the need for parity between any sentence imposed on the offender for the assault charge and any sentence that may have been imposed on Dogan.
Special circumstances
64Save for one matter, the issues that I have addressed in this judgment canvass the submissions made on behalf of the offender by Mr Stratton SC and the submissions of the Crown Prosecutor. The one matter of exception is that Mr Stratton SC submitted that it was appropriate to make a finding of special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act in relation to his client by reason of the combination of his subjective circumstances, especially his youth. I accept that his youth and other subjective circumstances are capable of justifying such a finding.  It is clear that he will require supervision and support upon his release from custody. However the sentences that I will impose will provide a suitably long period for his supervision with the result that I do not consider that any further adjustment is required on that account.  Nevertheless there will need to be a variation of the maximum ratio between the additional term and the non-parole period provided for in s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act to accommodate the partial accumulation of the sentence for assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon the sentence for manslaughter. 
Conclusion and sentences
65At a very young age the offender has embarked upon what appears to be a half-baked attempt at gangsterism.  It has left his good friend dead, a family devastated, him incarcerated and his daughter effectively fatherless. He has time to contemplate his actions. Unlike his friend, he will have an opportunity to make a life for himself.
66As the offender was taken into custody on 15 August 2011 it follows that his initial custodial sentence should commence from that date.
67Mr Abbas, the offence of manslaughter is a ""serious violence offence"" as defined in s 5A of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006.  I am obliged by s 25C of that Act to advise you of the existence of that legislation  and of its application to the offence you have committed.
68Khaldoun Abbas, for the manslaughter of Hassan Saleh you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  Pursuant to ss 44(1) and (2) of the Sentencing Act I set a non-parole period of seven years commencing on 15 August 2011, and an additional term of four  years  commencing 15 August 2018 and ending on 14 August 2022.
69Khaldoun Abbas, for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company you are convicted. You are sentenced to imprisonment for two years  commencing 15 August 2017.  Pursuant to s 45(1) of the Sentencing Act I decline to set a non-parole period by reason of the overlap between this period of imprisonment and that imposed for the offence of manslaughter and the length of the additional term that I have set for the latter. 
70Khaldoun Abbas, for the offence of  possessing a prohibited pistol while not being authorised to do so, you are convicted.  You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three months to date from today. 
71The overall sentence will comprise a non-parole period of eight years imprisonment and an additional term of three years.  The sentence is taken to have commenced on 15 August 2011.  The offender will be eligible for release on parole on 15 August 2019 and his last sentence will expire on 14 August 2022.

2706118,R v Sio (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1414,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
Introduction
1Last Friday afternoon, 20 September 2013, I acceded to the jury's request that they be permitted to leave early because the foreperson was indisposed and needed to attend a medical appointment. Soon afterwards the Sheriff's Officer informed me through my associate that members of the jury had raised a concern with him that a juror had been conducting Internet research on matters of law in connection with this trial.  
2I asked the Sheriff to ensure that the juror who was said to have made the enquiries was kept separate from the other jurors when she arrived for jury duty this morning, Monday 23 September 2013, so that I could investigate whether there was misconduct within the meaning of s 68C of the Jury Act 1977 (the Act) which would oblige me to discharge the juror pursuant to s 53A of the Act.
Relevant legislation
3Section 68C of the Act prohibits enquiries by jurors about trial matters.  Relevantly, s 68C(1) provides:Inquiries by juror about trial matters prohibited(1)  A juror for the trial of any criminal proceedings must not make an inquiry for the purpose of obtaining information about the accused, or any matters relevant to the trial, except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror. Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.. . .(4)  Anything done by a juror in contravention of a direction given to the jury by the judge in the criminal proceedings is not a proper exercise by the juror of his or her functions as a juror.(5)  For the purpose of this section, making an inquiry includes the following: . . .(b)  conducting any research, for example, by searching an electronic database for information (such as by using the Internet),. . .
4Section 53A of the Act provides for mandatory discharge of a juror who has engaged in misconduct in relation to the trial. It relevantly provides:Mandatory discharge of individual juror(1)  The court . . . must discharge a juror if, in the course of any trial . . .: . . .(c)  the juror has engaged in misconduct in relation to the trial . . ..(2)  In this section: misconduct, in relation to a trial . . ., means: (a)  conduct that constitutes an offence against this Act, or Note. For example, under section 68C it is an offence for a juror to make certain inquiries except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror.. . .
5In an investigation of alleged misconduct by a juror in the course of a trial, it is not necessary that the trial judge be satisfied that a juror has engaged in misconduct beyond reasonable doubt: Smith v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 325; 79 NSWLR 675 at [28] per RA Hulme J, McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J agreeing.
Facts
6At the commencement of the trial I directed the jury orally that they were not to make any inquiries on the Internet about the trial and they were not to conduct any research into the law. I also provided written directions to the jury which were marked MFI 1 which contained the following passage:
""It is criminal offence for a juror to make any inquiry during the course of a trial for the purpose of obtaining information about the accused or any matters relevant to the trial. The offence is punishable by maximum of 2 years imprisonment. For this offence ""making any inquiry"" includes: (i)asking a question of any person(ii)conducting any research including the use of the internet(iii)viewing or inspecting any place or object(iv)conducting an experiment(v)causing another person to make an inquiry.""
7Accordingly, a juror who conducted legal research on the Internet would be in breach of my directions and would therefore be in breach not only of s 68C(1) but also of s 68C(4) of the Act.
8When I arrived at Court on Monday morning I was handed a jury note which I have marked MFI 22 which reads as follows: ""It has come to the attention of the jury late Friday afternoon that a member of the jury has taken 'the indictment' and 'written directions of law' home to study and make notes without discussion with the rest of the jury.  Also let slip that research at home was made about obligations of law.  This is the same juror who is not understanding the direction and approach in reaching a verdict based on evidence.""
9For the purposes of investigating whether there had been private enquiries made about trial matters, I first examined the juror in question on oath pursuant to s 55DA(1) of the Act, which provides:Examination of juror-juror making private inquiries about trial matters(1)  A judge may examine a juror on oath to determine whether a juror has engaged in any conduct that may constitute a contravention of section 68C.
10The relevant juror denied that she had conducted any Internet research to do with this trial and said that, although she had done some research at the time of first receiving a letter requiring her to serve on a jury last year, she had not conducted any more recent enquiries about legal matters to do with criminal trials.
11In my view, s 55DA also authorises the examination of members of the jury who are not suspected of having engaged in any conduct that may constitute a contravention of s 68C. The use of the indefinite article before the word ""juror"" where it appears for the second time in s 68C(1) indicates that Parliament intended to authorise the examination of a juror who was not ""the"" juror who was suspected of engaging in the prohibited conduct.
12Accordingly, I examined the foreperson on oath.  The foreperson, who happened to be the juror who was indisposed and who was the reason for the early adjournment, said that, as he was leaving, the relevant juror gave him and other jurors to understand that she had taken her working copy of the indictment and the written directions of law home with her and had conducted some research on the Internet. The other jurors were shocked by her disclosure. One of the jurors told her ""to cease and desist"" and reminded her that such conduct was not allowed.  The foreperson then left in order to attend a medical appointment. As far as he was aware she did not speak further about her research.
13For abundance of caution I also asked the foreperson to nominate, after consultation with the other jurors and in the absence of the relevant juror, a person who would be best able to tell me what happened after the foreperson left.  The second juror gave evidence of the exchange concerning the disclosure  and the reaction of the jurors to that communication.  He said that the contents of the Internet research were not disclosed and that there was no further conversation to which the relevant juror was a party.  The only further conversation on the topic was that the remaining jurors approached the Sheriff's Officer with a view to informing me of the irregularity, as I had enjoined them to do in my opening remarks to the jury.  Although I had directed the jurors in those opening remarks that any suspected misconduct be communicated to me by way of note, it was nonetheless appropriate in the circumstances that they contact the Sheriff's Officer in order that I could be made aware, as soon as practicable, of what had occurred.
14I do not accept the relevant juror's evidence. I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence of the foreperson and the second juror that she conducted research of legal matters relating to this trial on the Internet. I find that she  engaged in misconduct in beach of s 68C of the Act. 
15Having found that the relevant juror engaged in misconduct in relation to the trial, I am obliged to discharge her from the jury pursuant to section 53A of the Act.
Order
16I make the following order:
(1)The relevant juror is discharged.

		24 September 2013",2013-09-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706121,R v Sio (No. 4) [2013] NSWSC 1415,"EXTEMPORE Judgment 
Introduction
1I discharged a juror for misconduct pursuant to s 53A of the Jury Act 1977 (the Act): R v Sio (No. 3) [2013] NSWSC 1414 (R v Sio (No. 3)). It remains for me to consider the next question: whether the discharge of a single juror ought lead to a discharge of the whole of the jury or whether I should order that the trial continue pursuant to s 53C of the Act. The questions whether a single juror ought be discharged and whether the whole jury ought be discharged are separate questions and must be addressed distinctly:  Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; 199 CLR 99 at [6] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J, [28]-[30] per McHugh J and [67] per Kirby J.
Relevant legislation
2Section 53C(1) relevantly provides:Discretion to continue trial or coronial inquest or discharge whole jury(1)  If ... the court ... discharges a juror in the course of a trial ..., the court ... must: (a)  discharge the jury if the court ... is of the opinion that to continue the trial ... with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, or(b)  if of the opinion that there is no such risk and subject to section 22, order that the trial ... continue with a reduced number of jurors.
3Section 22 of the Act relevantly provides:Continuation of trial or inquest on death or discharge of jurorWhere in the course of any trial ... any member of the jury ... is discharged by the court ... under Part 7A, the jury shall be considered as remaining for all the purposes of that trial ... properly constituted if: (a)  in the case of criminal proceedings, the number of its members: (i)  is not reduced below 10,...and if the court ... orders that the trial ... continue with a reduced number of jurors under Part 7A.
The Facts
4As referred to in R v Sio (No. 3), I examined the relevant juror (whom I discharged), the foreperson and another juror to ascertain the circumstances of the relevant juror's misconduct. The foreperson and the other juror informed me that when the jurors had discovered that the relevant juror had conducted Internet research, they were shocked and told her not to tell them what she had discovered because they knew that jurors were not supposed to conduct their own inquiries. 
5On examination under oath the foreperson gave the following answers to questions about what had occurred:Q. And do you recall what she said just as long as you don't reveal anything about deliberations about what research she had done?A. My understanding is she'd been studying points of law relating to - I am just trying to think of the exact words - relating to reasonable doubt and also she'd been investigating her responsibilities, but that was what I heard.  Others might have heard differently but that's the part that I heard, your Honour.
Q. All right.  And did she say anything to you about when that research had been conducted?A. Yes, your Honour, the night before at her home.
Q. So that's Thursday night?A. Yes, your Honour.
Q. You said late Friday afternoon; was that after the Court had been adjourned for the sick juror to go home?A. Yes, your Honour, that was.
Q. Although she told you a couple of topics of her research, did she tell you what she had found out or just that she had been doing research?A. She attempted to tell us, your Honour, and we refused to listen and asked her to cease and desist.
Q. Okay, and after you said that, was there any further discussion of that concerning her?A. Not while I was present, your Honour.
Q. All right.  So when you told her to cease and desist, did she cease and desist?A. In my presence, yes, she did.  As far as I know no one heard anything else from her.  We were a little taken aback.
6The second juror (not the foreperson) answered my questions in the course of my examination of him as follows: Q. And did she tell you that she had conducted any research to do with those documents [the indictment and written directions]?A. She said that when she had that information at home she did some research.
Q. All right.  And what then happened?A. We all dropped our mouths and said, ""What?"", and we ceased any conversation with that juror at that point.
Q. All right.  And I think you then, or some of you, told the Sheriff's Officer about that and I was then told about that?A. There's a little bit different - we all were, as we would each afternoon, just be packed up ready to go, some of us had left and this was eating at the back of our minds as to what we should do about it and that's when we decided to speak to the Sheriff.. . .
Q. And after the juror had been told ""stop"", did she actually stop or did she tell you--A. She stopped. Q. All right.  So did you hear at all what the content of her research was as distinct from the fact that she had carried out research?A. No, no, there was nothing there - the result of her research--
Q. When you say ""no, there was nothing there""--A. There was nothing there in what she'd said which - at that particular time, but the result of her making the statement we considered was the list of questions that she came in with early in the morning.
7When I had finished the examination I asked counsel if they wished me to ask any further questions but neither suggested any.
8Mr Crown submitted that because there was no contamination of the rest of the jury there was no risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  The Crown submitted that I should not discharge the whole jury and that I should order that the trial continue with the balance of 11 jurors pursuant to s 22 and s 53C of the Act.   
9Mr Watson, who appears on behalf of the accused, submitted that I ought discharge the whole of the jury because of the risk of substantial miscarriage of justice.  He submitted that, although the other jurors only became aware of the fact that Internet research had been conducted late Friday afternoon, the second juror referred in his examination to questions asked by the individual juror which he considered might have been informed by the Internet research. Mr Watson submitted that the jury as a whole had been contaminated by the research undertaken by the juror, although the other jurors did not appreciate either that it had occurred or its provenance until late on Friday afternoon. Mr Watson submitted that, in those circumstances, the research may have contaminated not only the particular juror's thinking but the jury generally in the course of their deliberations.
10I took the second juror's evidence about the ""list of questions"" to be a reference to questions that been reflected in jury notes which were asked of me in the course of the trial, including the meaning of ""positive act"", ""participation"" and ""beyond reasonable doubt"". I did not, however, explore this matter further lest I transgress into the area of the jury's deliberations: see generally R v K [2003] NSWCCA 406; 59 NSWLR 431 and the authorities referred to.  I note that Mr Watson did not suggest that I explore the matter further with the second juror.  I understood the remarks made by the second juror to be speculation by hindsight that questions asked earlier may well have arisen by reason of the research undertaken by the juror who was subsequently discharged.   11I consider that, in light of the evidence given by the foreperson and the second juror, that there has been no contamination of the jury notwithstanding that the discharged juror's questions may have been brought about by her concern about certain terms which may have arisen by reason of her research.
12The timely actions of the foreperson and other jurors who were present to stop the discharged juror from divulging the contents of her research were sufficient to prevent any potential contamination. Although it may be that the questions about the meaning of terms that I used in the written directions had their genesis in the unauthorised research, there was nothing in the questions that revealed either that research had been undertaken, or the contents of that unauthorised research. 
13In these circumstances, I do not consider that there to be any risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  Given that I am of the opinion that there is no such risk, and since there are still 11 members of the jury, I order, pursuant to section 53C(1)(b), that the trial continue with the reduced number of jurors.
Order
(1)The trial continue with the remaining eleven jurors.

		24 September 2013",2013-09-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706123,Application under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 by Tanveer Mehmood. [2013] NSWSC 1411,"DECISION
1The applicant, Tanver Mehmood, applies for an inquiry into his conviction on two charges, namely, import a prohibited import contrary to s 233(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and intentionally import a prohibited import under s 233BAB(5) of the Customs Act.
2The consequence of the applicant's conviction of federal offences is that an application under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) may result in the referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be heard as an appeal. The referral of the case for an inquiry by a judge of this Court is not available to Federal offenders : Application of Pearson [1999] NSWSC 143.
3For this limited purpose, the test is whether there is a ""doubt or question"" with respect to the convictions, that is, whether there is any material in the application that causes any unease or sense of disquiet in allowing the convictions to stand, or as to any mitigating circumstance, or as to any part of the evidence in the case.
4The applicant's central contention is that his conviction and sentence was obtained by fraudulent means, namely that the interview and his arrest were unlawful, that the charge was false and that the case lacked merit.
5The applicant was convicted and sentenced ex parte on 30 March 2010 in the Local Court. The offence under s 233(1)(b) of the Customs Act is a strict liability offence. The offence is a summary offence not punishable by imprisonment. The offence under section 233BAB (5) of the Customs Act is an indictable offence which is capable of being dealt with summarily. If dealt with summarily, the court can only impose sentence not exceeding two years or a fine not exceeding $13,200.
6The magistrate who convicted and sentenced the applicant in his absence on 30 March 2010 issued a warrant under s 25(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 with respect to the first offence. With respect to the second offence the magistrate fined the applicant $50,000 plus court costs.
7On 11 December 2012 the applicant appeared with representation before the Local Court seeking an annulment of his convictions under s 4 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. The applicant correctly identified the imposition of a sentence for the second offence above the maximum penalty set by the legislature. The Commonwealth DPP sought a sentence correction in accordance with s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The magistrate then re-sentenced the applicant in relation to the second offence by imposing a fine of $2000 and court costs. The applicant had not at that stage been sentenced in relation to the first offence. The magistrate accordingly sentenced the applicant to a fine of $9000 with court costs on the first offence.
8The magistrate then dealt with the s 4 application and granted an annulment of the convictions. The matters were accordingly restored to the list for a rehearing on 19 February 2013. Owing to the fact that the application under s 4 was made in excess of two years from the date of conviction, the magistrate had no jurisdiction to grant the annulment. The magistrate's decision was revoked in chambers and the fines were reinstated.
9On 8 January 2013, the applicant lodged an appeal in the District Court in relation to the sentences imposed on 11 December 2012. On 18 March 2013, Blackmore SC DCJ declined to hear the matter on the basis that the appeal was lodged out of time.
10This latter decision was based on a misunderstanding of the relevant date according to s 43(5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. An appeal against a penalty may be instituted within 28 days of the date of imposition. The application to the District Court on 8 January 2013 was made within 28 days of 11 December 2012.
11The applicant also could have sought leave to appeal against his convictions under the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. Pursuant to s 12(3)(a) of that Act, an application for leave to appeal may be made within 28 days after the imposition of sentence with respect to the relevant conviction.
12Despite these procedural irregularities, a review of the material confirms that there is no doubt or question as to the applicant's guilt, or as to any mitigating circumstance in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case. Ultimately, the applicant was given the correct sentence on 11 December 2012 at a time when he was legally represented.
13The circumstances surrounding the applicant's convictions for the relevant offences are as follows.
14The applicant arrived in Australia on 3 January 2009 on a Pakistani passport. He was questioned by Customs officers and found to be in possession of a laptop and disk that contained pornographic images, in particular child sex pornography, bestiality and rape. The child pornography files were videos, running from a few seconds to approximately 10 minutes in length.
15The apparent ages of the children depicted on these videos engaging in various sexual acts range between seven and 14 years.
16The applicant was interviewed at Sydney International Airport and stated that he was leaving on 6 January 2009. He made admissions that he was the owner of the goods and said that he had purchased the laptop 15 days before from a business associate. The applicant was cautioned. He claimed he was not aware that the goods were prohibited. He stated that he was aware that his business associate had downloaded various files to the laptop. The applicant said it was his intention to delete the file shortly after gaining possession. He provided the usernames and passwords of the account where the pornographic files were held.
17The applicant was again interviewed on 5 January 2009. He was cautioned and stated that he declared ""no"" on his incoming passenger card to the question relating to the importation of prohibited or restricted goods because he did not know that what he had was prohibited. He stated that he was the only user of the laptop, that he had been in Dubai on 24 and 25 November 2008 and at that time he was in possession of the laptop. The applicant changed the password to the account where the images were located. In the same account were pictures of the applicant's son and family.
18The applicant stated that he got the disk containing child pornography images from a mobile phone repair shop. He claimed that he had the disk for approximately 6 months but had never viewed it. He stated that the writing on the disk was his own.
19Despite the applicant's denial, forensic examination revealed that there was Internet access on the laptop. The pictures of the applicant's son were placed on the laptop on 6 December 2008. Some of the child pornography images on the laptop were accessed on 26 November 2008. Another file was burnt to the disk on 25 December 2007. That file contained two videos of a seven-year-old child engaged in sexual activity. There were also files that existed on both the disk and the laptop.
20For these reasons, the application is refused.

		20 September 2013",2013-09-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706136,Omorogbe v R [2013] NSWCCA 201,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA : I agree with the judgment of Adams J. I make the following additional observations on the issue upon which his Honour disagrees with Latham J. This issue concerns the sentencing judge's decision not to extend leniency to the applicant upon the basis of evidence that the applicant had, prior to committing the subject offence, attended at a newsagency and collected a package on behalf of the same person on whose behalf the applicant collected the package involved in the present offence. 

2The evidence giving rise to the issue was the following portion of a Statement of Facts tendered by the Crown at the sentencing hearing without objection:

""About 8.49am, a Record of Interview was conducted with the Offender. During the interview the Offender denied having attended any newsagency or any other post box facility to collect packages. The Offender then stated he had attended a newsagency and collected a package on behalf of Stephen Wayne on a previous occasion. The Offender provided the explanation that he was just doing someone a 'favour'. He denied being paid for his involvement in collecting packages containing narcotics"".

3In his Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge said the following about this evidence:

""I am satisfied the offender has in the past assisted in the collection of a parcel on behalf of the consignee, including the parcel the subject of these offences, and therefore I cannot extend to the offender the leniency I would have otherwise extended to him had this been an isolated incident"".

4In Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629, to which Latham J refers on this issue, a Statement of Facts was tendered by the Crown at the sentencing hearing without objection. This stated that the appellant, who had pleaded guilty to charges of drug importation, had told the informant:

""[T]hat he, the appellant, 'was involved in a continuing cocaine importation syndicate [of which another man was the principal] and that the syndicate had encountered difficulties with an established method of bringing cocaine into Australia from America'"" (at [7]).

5In the course of her Remarks on Sentence, the sentencing judge in that case said:

""The prisoner's prior good character in the sense that he comes before this court without any prior convictions is a matter which must receive some recognition. However, in the face of strong evidence establishing the prisoner's participation in cocaine importation by the same syndicate for some period of time before the commission of the instant offences, he cannot be treated as a first offender with the attendant leniency that that status usually attracts.""

6By majority (Kirby J dissenting), the High Court found that there was no error in the sentencing judge's approach. The plurality referred to the Court's obligation under s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), applicable in that case (as in the present), to take into account relevant matters of specified types ""known to the Court"". These include matters relating to the offender's character and antecedents. The High Court concluded that this provision did not impose ""a universal requirement that matters urged in sentencing hearings be either formally proved or admitted"" (at [21]). It went on to say that whilst matters adverse to the interests of the accused are to be established beyond reasonable doubt and those favouring the accused on the balance of probabilities, when taken in context the sentencing judge's observations did not treat the appellant ""as a person guilty of crimes with which he had not been charged"", rather:

""... the primary judge was doing no more than expressing a conclusion that the absence of prior convictions did not, as ordinarily would be the case, demonstrate absence of prior criminal behaviour. ... The fact that the primary judge was not persuaded that the appellant was probably a person who had not previously engaged in drug importation or money laundering reveals no error"" (at [29]).

7In Aoun v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 292, the sentencing judge said that he was not persuaded that the offender was a person of good character because actions of his were inconsistent with that proposition and he had associated with others who were not of good character. Hodgson JA (with whom Hislop and Latham JJ agreed), in concluding that the sentencing judge had not erred, said:

""25 ... [T]he very nature of what the applicant did in this case, including the breaking and removing of the steering column and ignition barrel of a stolen car and wiping the stolen car down with WD40 to remove fingerprints, could properly be taken as some evidence that what the applicant did on this particular occasion was not some isolated one-off aberration, but rather suggestive of familiarity with dishonest dealing with stolen cars. Although what the trial judge said in his ex tempore remarks could be understood as a positive finding to that effect, I do not understand him to have made such a positive finding, but rather to have treated that consideration, together with the applicant's association with Mr. B and others, as sufficient to justify his not being satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the applicant was otherwise of good character, much as the trial judge had done in Weininger. Viewed in that way, in my opinion no error is shown.""

8In the present case, the sentencing judge likewise took into account evidence as to the offender's prior conduct for the purpose of withholding from the offender the advantage of being treated as a person of good character who had not previously offended. As Weininger establishes, that course is permissible if there is material upon which it can properly be based, even though that material does not establish bad character beyond reasonable doubt. It simply needs to be such as to leave the sentencing judge unpersuaded on the balance of probabilities of the accused's good character. 

9In my view however the material before the Court in the present case did not fulfil that requirement. It did not rationally give rise to the inference that the appellant had, or may well have, engaged in earlier criminal or other disreputable conduct. I accept that the material was capable of founding a suspicion that that was so but any adverse inference beyond that would in my view be speculation. The applicant's previous newsagency collection may have been entirely innocent from his point of view. For example, Mr Wayne may have asked the applicant to collect a parcel for him to check the efficacy of steps to be taken in the later crime without communicating his purpose to the applicant. In such circumstances, the evidence could not be regarded as reflecting adversely on the applicant. 

10I note that the Statement of Facts refers to a denial by the applicant of payment for his ""involvement in collecting packages [plural] containing narcotics"", thereby perhaps implying that the package collected on the earlier occasion did in fact contain drugs. However the applicant did not admit that he knew that to be the case when he collected the package. Put shortly, there was nothing in the applicant's reported statement that involved an admission by him that he knew that he was doing anything wrong in making the previous newsagency collection.

11The position was otherwise in Weininger as in that case there was evidence of a clear admission by the appellant of involvement in previous, and plainly illegal, drug importation. Likewise the Court in Aoun took the view that the evidence in question suggested previous disreputable conduct. 

12For these reasons, I agree with Adams J that the sentencing judge in the present case was not entitled to conclude that the evidence of the applicant's prior collection for Mr Wayne of a parcel from a newsagency reflected adversely on the applicant and therefore provided a basis for not treating the offence for which he was being sentenced as an isolated incident. It follows that error in the sentencing process has been established. 

13I also agree that a lesser sentence than that imposed by the sentencing judge is warranted and that the applicant should accordingly be re-sentenced as proposed by Adams J.

14ADAMS J : I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Latham J. I am grateful for her Honour's recitation of the facts but am in respectful disagreement with her Honour's conclusion about the outcome of this appeal.

The earlier delivery

15In respect of the significance of the earlier collection of the parcel, as Latham J pointed out, the judge said - 

I am satisfied the offender has in the past assisted in the collection of a parcel on behalf of the consignee, including the parcel the subject of these offences (sic), and therefore I cannot extend to the offender the leniency I would have otherwise extended to him had this been an isolated incident.

16There was no evidence that the first parcel actually contained drugs, as distinct, for example, from being a dry run to check whether the scheme had been detected. The statement of the applicant to the police as summarised in the statement of facts was, in substance, a denial that he had picked up a package with drugs on an earlier occasion. The concession by counsel that there ""was other material that suggests [it was not an isolated incident]"" does not amount to accepting that his client's denial ought not to be accepted. The judge's positive finding that this was not an isolated offence was not justified by the evidence.

17The reference by the sentencing judge to ""isolated incident"" indicates, to my mind, that his Honour was of the view that this was not the applicant's first offence. If his Honour had simply meant that it was not a spur of the moment offence - since he had already collected a parcel - on a previous occasion, I do not believe that he would have referred to leniency which would otherwise have been extended. The language is typically that used when referring to evidence of previous convictions or previous offences. Although one must be very cautious about drawing inferences from exchanges between Bench and Bar, it is significant, I think, that after the judge said that the applicant would be treated as a person with no prior convictions, he commented, of the earlier receipt of a parcel, that it ""was the only matter in dissonance"", obviously, with taking that view.

Proposed sentence

18Although the sentence imposed is certainly within range, it is necessary that this Court consider independently whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law. In R v Taru [2002] NSWCCA 391, the facts were somewhat more serious than here in that the appellant had a greater involvement in the receipt of the drugs, as he arranged with innocent friends to use the premises to which the drugs were addressed and where he took possession of them. I would give significant weight to the fact that the applicant is in his fifties without a previous criminal conviction of any kind. This was indeed an isolated offence. Taking into account the subjective features found by the sentencing judge and adopting his Honour's view about the presence of special circumstances, a sentence of four years with a non-parole period of two years six months is within the range and is what I would impose.

Conclusion

19Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the sentence appealed from and substitute a sentence of four years with a non-parole period of two years six months.

20LATHAM J : The applicant, George Omorogbe, seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon him by Solomon DCJ on 2 February 2012 in respect of a charge of attempted possession of a marketable quantity of cocaine (106.4g pure), contrary to 11.1(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth).

21The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment. The applicant received a sentence of 5 years' imprisonment, including a non- parole period of 3 years.

22The applicant requires an extension of time within which to file the application for leave to appeal. The respondent does not oppose the grant of an extension of time.

The Offence

23On 5 October 2010 a private mailbox in the name of Stephen Wayne was leased by a male of African appearance at a newsagency in Engadine. The male produced a false New South Wales drivers licence in the name of Stephen Wayne when leasing the box.

24On 14 January 2011 the owner of the newsagency contacted Australian Federal Police (AFP) and advised them of an express mail package sent from China to Stephen Wayne. The sender of the package was a company located in Zhengzhou, China.

25Police attended the newsagency, seized the package and examined the contents. There were 169 women's purses, each individually wrapped in plastic. Inside six of the purses police found a concealed quantity of white powder. Of the 254.6 g of white powder 42% was pure cocaine.

26Later that day the applicant attended the newsagency to collect the package. He was in possession of a delivery collection slip for the package. He was shown to the rear of the premises where a member of the AFP posing as an employee of the newsagency presented her identification and arrested the applicant. The applicant ran from the shop but was detained by other AFP members a short while later. At that time the applicant had the key for the relevant private mailbox in his hand.

27The applicant was interviewed by police and denied attending the newsagency to collect the package. Later in the interview he claimed he was doing a favour for someone and that he had previously collected a package addressed to Stephen Wayne. He claimed he had received a telephone call from someone asking him to collect the package and that the key to the postbox had been placed under his door. He denied being paid to collect packages containing drugs. He denied any knowledge that the package he attempted to collect contained drugs.

The Sentencing Exercise

28In the course of sentencing, his Honour noted the maximum penalty, that the total pure quantity of cocaine was 106.4 g (more than 50 times the threshold for a marketable quantity of cocaine), that the street value of the cocaine was estimated at between $76,000.00 and $85,120.00, and that the wholesale value was estimated at $40,500.00.

29His Honour characterised the role of the applicant as a ""collector"" and was not satisfied that the applicant's purpose was anything other than to collect the drug for persons unknown.

30At the time of the applicant's arrest he was in possession of $805.00 in cash which his Honour found was the applicant's payment for collecting the package.

31Ultimately, his Honour found that the offence was at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness, but noted that persons who collect drugs play a necessary role in the dissemination of drugs into the community.

32His Honour said :-

I am satisfied the offender has in the past assisted in the collection of a parcel on behalf of the consignee, including the parcel the subject of these offences (sic), and therefore I cannot extend to the offender the leniency I would have otherwise extended to him had this been an isolated incident.


Subjective Circumstances

33The applicant was born in Nigeria in 1954. He came to Australia in 2007 for the purpose of improving life for his wife and two children, who remained in Nigeria. His upbringing in Nigeria was described as tragic. It was accepted that the applicant would have difficulty serving his sentence because of his isolation from his family.

34The applicant wrote a letter to the judge expressing his contrition, which his Honour accepted. He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and was accorded a 25% discount for his plea. He had no prior convictions. He was in debt at the time and was an illegal immigrant. He had no history of drug use or addiction and no relevant illness apart from high blood pressure. He had used his time since his arrest to improve himself within the prison system. His Honour found that he was unlikely to re-offend.

The Grounds of Appeal : Insufficient Weight to Subjective Circumstances and Manifest Excess

35These two grounds may be dealt with together. The ground complaining that the judge gave insufficient weight to the applicant's age, health and prior good character is essentially an argument advanced in support of the ground of manifest excess : Hanania v R [2012] NSWCCA 220 at [33]. 

36A report under the hand of a psychologist which was tendered on the sentencing proceedings set out in detail the applicant's family history, his education, his relationship, employment and health history and his current circumstances. 

37During his Honour's remarks on sentence his Honour said :-

I have regard to the offender's background. The offender has no criminal record. The offender was born in Nigeria in 1954. The offender was orphaned at the age of two years and was brought up by his uncle in difficult circumstances. The offender left school at the age of 12 and then left his uncle's home and commenced work and paid for his high schooling. The offender has been married twice. The offender's first wife died in tragic circumstances when he she was shot in a drive-by shooting in Nigeria. The offender brought up the four children of that union. The offender remarried and has a wife and two children in Nigeria. The offender at the age of 52 came to Australia and at the time of the commission of the offence was an illegal immigrant. The offender came to Australia for the purpose of improving the lot of his family. The offender has no history of drug use or addiction, however the offender is presently on medication for high blood pressure.

38All of these matters were contained within the psychological report. There is no substance to the submission that his Honour failed to have adequate regard to the applicant's subjective case.

39None of these factors entitled the applicant to any particular leniency. He was not a youthful offender. To the extent that the applicant reported depression, anxiety and stress, these symptoms were a product of his incarceration and his isolation from his family. There was no submission made on the applicant's behalf that he suffered from any cognitive deficit or any relevant mental illness that might reduce the appropriate emphasis on general deterrence.

40The other material tendered in the applicant's case on sentence included a letter from the applicant, a number of certificates attesting to the applicant's progress in custody and the Justice Health records relating to the applicant. The letter from the applicant primarily expressed his contrition and remorse, which was accepted by the judge. There is no basis for the submission that the judge failed to consider the combination of this material for the purposes of sentence.

41One controversial aspect of the remarks on sentence remains. In the passage set out at [32] above, his Honour clearly states that the applicant was not entitled to leniency on the basis that he had previously taken possession of a package containing an illegal substance. This appears to be a reference to the contents of a record of interview between the applicant and the police on the morning of the applicant's arrest. In the course of that interview the applicant stated that he had attended the newsagency and collected a package on behalf of Stephen Wayne on a previous occasion. The applicant did not however admit that he knew or believed that the package contained illegal drugs.

42It is accepted that such a finding could only have been made from the combination of circumstances, including the fact that the private mailbox was opened on 5 October 2010 by a male of African appearance in a false name, following the production of false driver's license. 

43It is also relevant to note that in an exchange between the judge and the applicant's counsel, it was acknowledged by counsel that, whilst the applicant had :-

made an assertion that it is an isolated incident, ............. There's other material that may suggest that is not the case. ......... That's about as far as I can take that. He of course has not been convicted of any other matters - and he's still entitled to the leniency of - to the extent that he is entitled to leniency, for no prior convictions. I accept the principle so that - he's still entitled to that leniency.

44This concession appears to recognise what the plurality (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) said in Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14 ; 212 CLR 629 at [18] to [21] (citations omitted) :- 

In R v Olbrich, the Court examined a number of questions relating to fact finding in sentencing, usually discussed under the rubric of the onus and standard of proof in sentencing. As the joint reasons point out, ""[r]eferences to onus of proof in the context of sentencing would mislead if they were understood as suggesting that some general issue is joined between prosecution and offender in sentencing proceedings"". The Court adopted what was said by the majority in the Court of Appeal of Victoria, in R v Storey, that a sentencing judge: 
""may not take facts into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the accused unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are circumstances which the judge proposes to take into account in favour of the accused, it is enough if those circumstances are proved on the balance of probabilities."" 
For present purposes, however, attention to questions of onus and standard of proof may distract attention from another important aspect of the decision in Olbrich. Framing the question in terms of the onus and standard of proof may suggest that all disputed issues of fact related to sentencing must be resolved for or against the offender. That is not so. As was recognised in Olbrich, some disputed issues of fact cannot be resolved in a way that goes either to increase or to decrease the sentence that is to be imposed. There may be issues which the material available to the sentencing judge will not permit the judge to resolve in that way. 
It had been submitted in Olbrich that, in sentencing a person knowingly concerned in the importation of narcotic drugs into Australia, it was necessary to classify that person's participation in the importation as that of a principal or a courier, and it was further submitted that, if it was not established beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was a principal, the offender should be sentenced as a courier. As the majority pointed out in Olbrich, prosecuting authorities and a sentencing judge will often have only the most limited and imperfect information about how it was that the accused came to commit the offence for which he or she is to be sentenced. Although s 16A(2)(a) requires a sentencing judge to take account of the nature and circumstances of the offence, that requirement is not absolute. They are to be taken into account only to the extent that they are relevant and known to the court. The sentencing judge may not be able to make findings about all matters that may go to describe those circumstances. In particular, an offender may urge a particular view of the nature and circumstances of the offence, favourable to the offender. The sentencing judge may be unpersuaded that the view urged is, more probably than not, an accurate view of the circumstances. In such a case, it is not correct that the judge is bound to sentence the offender on that favourable basis, unless the prosecution proves the contrary beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, in the particular facts of Olbrich, where the offender asserted that he was no more than a courier of the drugs, but the sentencing judge disbelieved him, it was neither necessary nor appropriate to sentence him on the basis that he was a courier. 
To frame the relevant question in terms of the onus and standard of proof may also suggest that the only material which may be treated as being ""known to the court"", and on which the judge may act in sentencing an offender, is material revealed by the plea or verdict of guilty, admission by the offender, or evidence received on the sentencing hearing. The use of the phrase ""known to the court"", rather than ""proved in evidence"", or some equivalent expression, suggests strongly that s 16A was not intended to require the formal proof of matters before they could be taken into account in sentencing. Rather, having been enacted against a background of well-known and long-established procedures in sentencing hearings, in which much of the material placed before a sentencing judge is not proved by admissible evidence, the phrase ""known to the court"" should not be construed as imposing a universal requirement that matters urged in sentencing hearings be either formally proved or admitted. (italics not in original)

45His Honour did not sentence the applicant for anything other than one offence and did not regard any previous occasion as an aggravating factor. His Honour was obviously not persuaded that the applicant's assertion that this was an isolated incident ought be accepted. There is no basis for concluding that his Honour increased the sentence above what was otherwise appropriate. Accordingly, there was no error in the approach ultimately adopted by the judge.

46In support of the ground of manifest excess, the applicant draws attention to five matters in the District Court relating to drug offences in January and February 2012. Two of the five cases refer to charges of manufacture and possession. Two refer to charges of importation of amounts of cocaine and ecstasy in excess of 1 kg. 

47One case refers to a charge of attempt possess 1.3 kg of cocaine (pure). In that case, the offender received a combined discount of 45% for his plea and assistance, resulting in a sentence of five years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and six months : R v Phu Long Pham (unreported NSWDC 20 January 2012).

48A further schedule of cases said to be comparable with the applicant's case reveals twenty decisions of the Queensland, Victorian and NSW courts dealing with charges relating to the importation of marketable quantities of drugs. Of the seven cases in the schedule that relate to attempt possession of a marketable quantity of a prohibited import, there are three cases that are in the order of 100 g of either cocaine or heroin. Only one of those cases received a lesser head sentence (4 years and 9 months) than the applicant, although the non-parole period was the same : R v Taru [2002] NSWCCA 391. An appeal against severity was dismissed.

49The applicant's counsel at sentence handed up written submissions which stated that the decision in Taru provided ""significant guidance to the court in determining the appropriate sentence."" This submission was obviously accepted by the judge. 

50The applicant has not demonstrated that the sentence imposed was plainly unjust.

51Since drafting these reasons, I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of Macfarlan JA and Adams J. If it be assumed that his Honour did fall into error in the manner identified by Macfarlan JA and Adams J, contrary to my view, this Court has stated on numerous occasions since R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 ; 53 NSWLR 704 at [79] that error does not automatically trigger a re-sentencing exercise. Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 has significant work to do. The fact that the sentence imposed is within the appropriate range does not preclude this Court from reaching the conclusion that some lesser sentence is warranted in law. However, in all of the subjective and objective circumstances of this case, I would not reach that conclusion.

52The orders I propose are :-

(1)Grant an extension of time within which to file the appeal.

(2)Leave to appeal granted.

(3)Appeal dismissed.

		17 September 2013",2013-09-16 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706139,Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of R A Hulme J.  I agree with him that ground 1, the alleged non-compliance with Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120, lacks merit, and that any error as alleged in ground 2 in the application of s 21A(2)(eb) by reason of the assaults having taken place in the home of the applicant, at which the complainant was a guest, does not mean that some less severe sentence was warranted such as to engage s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  I also agree with his Honour's reasoning as to it being open to have regard as an aggravating factor to the fact that the assaults took place upon a guest in the applicant's home, notwithstanding the authorities in this Court, and I (like Simpson and Price JJ) share his reservations about those authorities.
2There is a further reason for refusing the application for an extension of time.  It is well established that a change in the law, even a change whose effect is that a conviction would be quashed on appeal, is not of itself sufficient to warrant the granting of an extension of time in which to appeal.  This is an aspect of the principle of finality.
3That principle was applied in R v Ramsden [1972] Crim LR 547, where a subsequent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal had laid down the law differently from that which had been applied when Mr Ramsden was convicted, yet his application for an extension of time to appeal was refused, notwithstanding that it was assumed that the summing up at his trial was with the benefit of hindsight shown to be defective.  
4This Court applied the same principle in Reg v Unger [1977] 2 NSWLR 990, where the applicant had been convicted of selling Indian hemp pursuant to a provision under the Poisons Act 1966 which deemed  possession of in excess of a prescribed quantity of a drug of addiction to amount to possession for supply or sale.  Street CJ, with whom Begg and Ash JJ agreed, proceeded on the basis that the regulation prescribing the quantity was invalid and had not been validated retrospectively by the remedial legislation (at 996B).  The Chief Justice said that there was no taint necessarily introduced into the conviction by reason of the subsequent finding that the regulation on which it depended was invalid.  That was a consequence of the doctrine of merger, as explained by Dixon J in Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co Pty Ltd and Meakes v Dignan (1931) 46 CLR 73 at 106 (another conviction permitted to stand notwithstanding it was based upon a disallowed regulation).  Gageler J referred to the same doctrine as underpinning the independent legal force possessed by judicial orders in State of NSW v Kable [2013] HCA 26; (2013) 87 ALJR 737 at [53] (another case where a man was imprisoned pursuant to orders which would never have been made had the judges at first instance and on appeal correctly determined that the Community Protection Act 1994 was invalid).
5It may seem hard for a conviction to be permitted to stand when it is based upon a superseded view of the common law or upon an Act or regulation which has later been held to be invalid.  That serves to illustrate the importance of the broader issues which are involved.  Street CJ explained the position, in a highly influential passage, as follows (at 995F-996A):
""This concept of merger is no blind, arbitrary proposition. It is founded deeply in the fabric of the philosophy of the common law. Although in pure theory the overruling or modification by judicial decision of previous conceptions of legal principle does no more than correct a departure from the timeless perfection of the law, the plain fact is that legal principle is constantly evolving and being moulded in the light of the changing and developing social context. Recognizing this, there has always been an unwillingness to permit the re-opening of past decisions. Indeed the process of appeal, either civil or criminal, is a comparatively recent andstatutory concept - it finds no basis in the common law itself. Thisfinality of decision in each individual case leaves the courts free to permit a judicious flexibility in the development of principle in later cases, free from inhibition lest such development may set at large disputes that have previously been resolved. The concept of merger in judgment, both in the civil and in the criminal field, to which Dixon CJ referred, equally with the doctrine of res judicata, serves this requirement of flexibility for potential development of the law.""
For those reasons, the Court in Unger did not exercise its discretion to extend time.
6Those principles have been applied in this Court, including in R v Gregory [2002] NSWCCA 199 at [38]-[45] and Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262; (2010) 205 A Crim R 138 at [19]-[24].  They were applied by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in R v Knight [1998] 1 NZLR 583 at 587-588 on which in turn the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal has consistently relied (the most recent decision is Chau Cheuk Yiu v Poon Kit Sang [2012] HKCFA 42; [2013] 1 HKC 478: see at [9]-[11] and [53]-[59]).  All four of those decisions recognise that ""exceptional"" circumstances must be shown to warrant departing from the principle of finality.  
7What will amount to the requisite exceptional circumstances cannot be  defined exhaustively.  However, in the present case, the application is more than three years out of time, and the majority of the sentence has been served.  Most importantly, there is no explanation at all for the delay from 30 October 2009 until late 2011, save that the decision in Muldrock pointed to the possibility of an argument that the sentencing judge, who was bound by R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, had erred.  That demonstrates the wholly adventitious background to the application which is now made.  In my view this is a clear case for not departing from the principle stated in Unger.
8For those reasons, in addition to those given by RA Hulme J, I would refuse to extend the time within which an application for leave to appeal against sentence may be made. 
9R A HULME J:  Andres Montero (""the applicant"") was sentenced, after being found guilty by a jury, for one offence of indecent assault (s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) and two offences of aggravated sexual assault (s 61J(1)). 
10The maximum penalty for indecent assault is imprisonment for 5 years.  The maximum penalty for aggravated sexual assault is imprisonment for 20 years.  For the latter there is also prescribed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 
11His Honour Judge O'Connor sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 2 years for the indecent assault; 4 years for the first of the aggravated sexual assaults; and 4 years 6 months for the second such offence.  The sentence for the latter was partially accumulated so that the total effective sentence was one of 7 years with a minimum custodial component of 4 years 6 months.  The applicant will become eligible for release on parole on 28 October 2013.
12The applicant raised two grounds of appeal:  first, that the judge erred by attaching ""undue significance"" to the prescription of a standard non-parole period for the aggravated sexual assault offences; and second, by taking into account as an aggravating factor that the offences occurred in the applicant's home.
13The judge imposed sentence on 30 October 2009. An application for an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal was filed over three years later, on 26 November 2012.  I will say more about this later.
Facts
14There was no dispute with the facts summarised in the judge's sentencing remarks and so I draw from them the following.
15The offences occurred on 1 January 2008.  The complainant was then aged 15.  She knew the applicant by having been a friend of his girlfriend, Kelly, and his girlfriend's younger sister, Lauren.  The applicant was aged 24. 
16On New Year's Eve, the applicant, Kelly, Lauren and the complainant were at a party where they consumed alcohol.  They left at about 2.30am and went to the applicant's home where they stayed for the remainder of the night.
17The applicant and Kelly initially were in one bedroom while the complainant and Lauren were in another.  The applicant went to the other bedroom after an argument with Kelly.  Acknowledging that it was his house, Lauren gave up her place in the bed with the complainant and went to the other bedroom to sleep with her sister.  The applicant got into bed with the complainant who was asleep and unaware of his presence.
18The complainant was woken at about 8.30am by the applicant.  It is unnecessary to go through the detail of events but they included the applicant indecently assaulting the complainant by touching, kissing and licking her breast.  He penetrated her vagina with his finger and then with his penis, despite her resistance.  Her struggles did, however, force him to desist.  He then masturbated and ejaculated onto her leg.  
19DNA consistent with having emanated from the applicant was subsequently identified in semen inside the complainant's underpants and in saliva on her breast.  His defence at trial, that any sexual activity was consensual, was obviously rejected by the jury.
The applicant's personal circumstances
20The subjective case presented on the applicant's behalf on sentence was remarkable only in that there was nothing about him that served to explain his offending behaviour.  Aside from two traffic offences there was no criminal history.  He had been raised in a caring and supportive family environment.  He had been in regular employment and was qualified in graphic design, small business management, website design and screen-printing.  He had most recently been working as a self-employed graphic designer.  
21The applicant described himself as a social drinker and he was not involved in illegal drug taking.  He said that on the night of the offence he had about six beers and was ""tipsy but not intoxicated"". He was described in evidence by his mother and his partner as a caring, family-oriented individual.  He and his partner had plans to marry and raise a family.
22The applicant declined to discuss (on legal advice) the offence with the authors of a Pre-Sentence Report and a Psychological Pre-Sentence Assessment Report.  That limited an assessment of his risk of further sex offending but with that limitation in mind, he was assessed by the psychologist who wrote the second of those reports as having a ""moderate-low"" risk of recidivism.
Sentencing remarks
23The learned judge took into account in the applicant's favour that the offences were not planned.  He also had regard to his lack of relevant previous convictions; good character; unlikelihood of re-offending; and good prospects of rehabilitation.
24The judge referred to s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provides that it is an aggravating feature if ""the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person"".  This aspect is the subject of the second ground of appeal and will be considered in that context.
25After referring to the various matters in ss 21A(2) and (3) that he found to be relevant, the judge then turned to a discussion of the objective seriousness of the aggravated sexual assault offences and referred to the following as ""matters ... of relevance"":
There was no planning and the offences were opportunistic.  
The circumstance of aggravation element of the s 61J(1) offences (the complainant being under the age of 16) was regarded as less serious than the other circumstances listed in s 61J(2).
The complainant was 7 months short of her 16th birthday which ""places that particular aggravating factor in the lower spectrum of seriousness"".
The applicant believed that the complainant was aged 16 or over. 
There were no threats made or pressure applied before or after the offences to secure compliance or ensure silence.
The complainant did not sustain any injury.
There was no personal degradation of the complainant.
As to the penetration, the judge noted that the two episodes were of short duration; full penile penetration was not achieved; and ejaculation did not occur within the vagina.  In the circumstances of the case, the offence involving penile penetration was more serious than the offence involving digital penetration.
Masturbating and ejaculating upon the victim made the offences more serious.
26After discussing these matters the judge immediately proceeded to announce that the objective seriousness of the aggravated sexual assault offences ""fall below the mid-range for offences of that nature"".  
27His Honour then said that the indecent assault offence, ""involving the licking and kissing of the victim's breast, [which] again took place over a relatively short period of time, is towards the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". 
28The judge declined to apply the standard non-parole period prescribed for the aggravated sexual offences.  He said:
Having regard to my findings in respect of the objective seriousness of counts 3 and 4 and my findings in respect of the aggravating and mitigating factors in 21A(2) and (3), I am of the view that the standard non-parole period should not be imposed.  Notwithstanding such finding, I have taken the standard non-parole period into account as a benchmark or a guidepost in determining the appropriate sentences.  The maximum penalty and the legislature's decision to include a standard non-parole period for such offences, indicates the serious nature of the offences.  It is clear that sentences that carry a clear deterrent message must be imposed. (ROS 15)
29The judge then referred to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and specifically mentioned two of the purposes of sentencing there listed:  ""recognition of harm done to the victim and the rehabilitation of the offender"". 
30His Honour adverted to the totality principle and indicated that the sentence for the indecent assault offence would be wholly concurrent but there would be partial accumulation of the sentences for the other offences. 
31Special circumstances justifying a reduction of the non-parole component of the overall term were found on the basis of the partial accumulation of sentences; the applicant's age; the fact that he had not previously been to gaol; the fact that he was being held in protective custody (at his own request); and that he would need assistance on reintegrating into society.
Ground 1:  ""Inappropriately attaching undue significance"" to the standard non-parole period sentencing scheme
32This ground relates to what the judge said in the passage from the sentencing remarks extracted above (at [28]). 
33The sentencing exercise occurred at the time when R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 was thought to set out the correct approach to sentencing for offences for which a standard non-parole period is prescribed.  Way, of course, was overruled by the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
34Counsel for the applicant relied in written submissions upon the following from Muldrock, at [25] and [28]:
... The court is not required when sentencing for a Div 1A offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed to an assessment of whether the offence is within the midrange of objective seriousness.
...
Nothing in the amendments introduced by the Amending Act requires or permits the court to engage in a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period.
35It was contended that the passage of the sentencing remarks set out above supported the following submission:
His Honour's approach was to first find reasons why the SMNP period [sic] should not be applied and then proceeded to take into account the SMNP period in any case as a 'benchmark or guidepost'.  If the SMNP period had no application there was consequently no mandatory requirement to then use the SMNP as a sentencing 'guide or signpost'.  This approach also suggested an erroneous two stage sentencing process contrary to Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357.
36In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant contended that ""his Honour was effectively using the standard non-parole period as controlling and effectively an imperative consideration of the ultimate punishment that the applicant received"" (T3.5).
37These submissions should be rejected.
38Whilst the judge was sentencing prior to Muldrock, his approach in no way conflicted with anything said there.  The passage from the sentencing remarks simply establishes (a) that the judge was not going to impose the standard non-parole period, and (b) that the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period remained relevant as a benchmark or guidepost in determining the appropriate sentences.   There is no complaint about the first of those propositions; nor could there be.  And the second proposition is supported by Muldrock itself, at [27]:
Section 54B(2) and s 54B(3) oblige the court to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence. In so doing, the court is mindful of two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. The latter requires that content be given to its specification as ""the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". 
39There is nothing in the sentencing remarks that indicates that the judge erred by adopting a ""two-staged"" approach to the assessment of sentence, or by regarding the standard non-parole period as having ""determinative significance"": errors identified in Muldrock at [28] and [32].   Moreover, the fact that the judge set non-parole periods for the aggravated sexual assault offences of 3 years and 2 years, when the standard non-parole period is 10 years, suggests that the bearing that it had on sentence was relatively minimal.
40Ground 1 has no merit.
Ground 2:  Error in the application of s 21A(2)(eb) by taking into account as an aggravating factor that the offences took place in the home of the applicant
41The sentencing judge said:
So far as aggravating factors are concerned, pursuant to s 21A(2), the following subparagraphs are of relevance and are to be taken into account:  (eb)  The offence was committed in the home of the offender.  This aggravating factor coincidentally commenced on the day of the offence.  Mr Wendler, who appeared on behalf of the offender, submitted this aggravating factor was in the ""neutral category"".  I note from the Attorney-General's second reading speech he said:
""The courts have long recognised that it is an aggravating circumstance when victims are assaulted in their own homes.  The government takes the position that any offence committed in the home of the victim, even if it is also the home of the accused or in the home of another person, violates that person's reasonable expectation of safety and security.  This aggravating factor preserves the notion of sanctity of the home where individuals are entitled to feel safe from harm of any kind.  This protection should apply in any home"".
I regard this aggravating factor as established although perhaps not in such a serious category as an offence committed in the victim's own home, where the expectation of safety and security would even be greater.
42Subsection (2)(eb) was inserted in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007 (NSW).  It took effect on 1 January 2008, the day of the applicant's offences.  It provides that it is an aggravating factor where an ""offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person"".  But regard should also be had to s 21A(4):
(4)  The court is not to have regard to any such aggravating or mitigating factor in sentencing if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so.
43In OH Hyunwook v R [2010] NSWCCA 148 at [40], doubt was expressed by Kirby J, with the concurrence of Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and Johnson J, about whether s 21A(2)(eb) was limited to situations in which the offence was committed by an intruder into the home.  However, in EK v R [2010] NSWCCA 199; (2010) 79 NSWLR 740, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J, I held (at [79]) that it was not an aggravating factor where an offence is committed in a home in which both the complainant and offender lived.  In doing so, I accepted the correctness of what had been said under the general law in R v Gazi Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125.  That reasoning was adopted in Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [111]-[112] per McClellan CJ at CL, James and Davies JJ agreeing; R v BIP [2011] NSWCCA 224 at [59]-[61] per Hoeben J (as he then was), Bathurst CJ and James J agreeing; in DS v R [2012] NSWCCA 159 at [145] per Beazley JA, Harrison and McCallum JJ agreeing; and Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [72] per Bellew J, McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing.  Error in this fashion was conceded by the Crown in R v MH [2011] NSWCCA 230 (at [34]). 
44In NLR v R [2011] NSWCCA 246, a sentencing judge had said ""the offences took place in the home of the offender"", but this was in the context of a discussion about a step-grandfather having violated the trust of two step-granddaughters in a place where they ought to have been safe from such violation.  It was held (at [23]) by James J, Bathurst CJ and Johnson J agreeing, that the judge had not taken into account the location of the crimes itself as an aggravating factor.
45Similarly, in DJM v R [2013] NSWCCA 101, Blanch J, Basten JA and Simpson J agreeing, regarded (at [7]-[10]) a sentencing judge's reference to the offences being committed in the home of the offender and complainant as being nothing more than a reference to the complainant having no place of safety to escape to.
46In Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210, there was contended to be error in the sentencing judge having stated that she took into account as an aggravating circumstance that ""this offence was committed in the home of the offender"".  The offences involved acts of violence towards two people with whom the offender was living.  The Crown, as in the present case, expressly abandoned its proposed submission that previous decisions of this Court in relation to s 21A(2)(eb) where the offender was lawfully in the home were wrong.  In relation to that I said, at [44]:
The Crown abandoned its proposed alternative argument in relation to this ground and conceded the correctness of those decisions.  This is despite the fact that the plain words of s 21A(2)(eb) do not support the limitation that this Court has placed on their application.  It is also despite the fact that it was never intended by Parliament that there should be the constraint upon their application that this Court has imposed:  see the second reading speech of the Attorney-General, New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates, Hansard, 17 October 2007 (p 2667ff) where it was said that it would be ""an aggravating circumstance when victims are assaulted in their own homes ... even if it is also the home of the accused"".  However, given the concession by the Crown, now is not the occasion for reconsideration of what has been said previously in this Court on the subject.
47Simpson J, with the concurrence of Price J, added, at [1]-[2]:
I have read in draft the judgment of R A Hulme J.  I agree with his Honour's analysis and the orders he proposes.  In relation to Ground 1, I note that the Crown initially sought to challenge the correctness of previous decisions of this Court that hold that the aggravating feature specified in s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (that the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person) does not extend to offences committed in the home of the victim if the offender lives in the same home.  The Crown expressly abandoned that challenge.  Why that course was taken is not apparent.
I understand R A Hulme J to have expressed some reservations about the principle stated.  I share those reservations.  It is, perhaps, time for re-examination by this Court of those previous decisions.  
48It was ultimately held that there was no error in the approach taken by the sentencing judge:  Melbom at [51]-[55].  If she had limited her reasons to the bare fact that the offence was committed in the home in which the offender and the victims lived then error would have been established.  But the judge went on to provide an explanation as to why she regarded the offence as being more serious.  She said that there was ""an element of domestic violence""; the victims had nowhere to go because of the domestic relationship; and there was ""a special geographical vulnerability for the victims"".  The judge also referred to the offender having a right to be in the residence of the victims ""which made him more dangerous"".  This was interpreted as meaning that he was armed and volatile and in a relatively confined space with the victims, who were cut off from people in the outside world who may otherwise have intervened.  
49These were all matters that were relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence.  The introductory words at the beginning of that passage of the sentencing remarks - ""this offence was committed in the home of the offender"" - had no material bearing upon sentence.  A further matter confirming that conclusion was that the judge's assessment of the level of objective seriousness of the offence in question was broadly consistent with the assessment that had been suggested on behalf of the offender.
50The written submissions for the applicant in the present case simply referred to Ingham v R and NLR v R in support of a proposition that s 21A(2)(eb) ""does not operate to aggravate an offence in circumstances where the offender has a lawful entitlement to be in the premises where it is alleged the offences took place"". 
51The Crown submission was that the judge did not regard the location of the offences as greatly exacerbating the criminality, but rather doing so to some slight degree.  It was submitted that the judge ""did not give this feature great weight"" and that ""arguably, it had very little or even no impact on the sentences imposed"".   It was also submitted that, in any event, no lesser sentence was warranted:  s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
52I am not persuaded that it was wrong in the circumstances of this case for the judge to have regarded it as an aggravating feature that the offences occurred in the applicant's home because it was not that fact alone that was taken into account.  There is no question that the applicant was lawfully there.  But the complainant was a guest.  She had gone to bed with an 18 year old woman who had been her friend for some 6 years.  She was entitled in those circumstances to a sense of safety and security.  However, unbeknown to her, the applicant took the place of her friend while she slept.  And in the morning, he raped her.
53This is a different set of circumstances to those in the cases where error was found in having regard to the location of the offences in the home as an aggravating circumstances. R v Gazi Comert concerned a sexual assault by a husband of his wife in their home.  EK v R concerned sexual assaults by a father in the home in which he and the complainant lived.  In Ingham v R, the offender was a regular overnight visitor at the house where he sexually assaulted two complainants who were temporarily in his care as babysitter.  R v BIP, DS v R and Essex v R were concerned with sexual assaults in the home by men upon children of their partner. 
54In the present case, the judge appeared to be as much concerned with the ""expectation of safety and security"" aspect, contrasting as he did with there being a greater such ""expectation"" if the offence occurred in the victim's own home.  This leads me to consider, even if it was contrary to what this Court has previously said about the aggravating factor of offences being committed in a home by persons lawfully entitled to be there, that the judge was nevertheless entitled to take the violation of the expectation of safety and security into account as rendering the offence more serious.
55In the event that I am wrong, and an error has been made out, it was not, for the following reasons, a material one.
56First, the matter does not appear to have had a significant impact upon the judge's assessment of sentence in any event.  It could have had such impact if the judge regarded the objective seriousness of the offences as being higher than was warranted.  But there was no challenge to the assessments the judge made in that respect.  
57Another reason why it appears the matter was insignificant in terms of the assessment of objective seriousness is that the reference to s 21A(2)(eb) appeared earlier in the judge's sentencing remarks.  But when the judge came to refer to matters he regarded as relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness (which I have set out earlier at [18]), the feature of the offence being committed in a home was not mentioned.  
58Also, the sentence structure encompassed the identified criminality adequately, but not harshly.  For each of the two offences where there were the statutory guideposts of a maximum penalty of 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years, there were sentences of 4 years and 4½ years with non-parole periods of 3 years and 2 years.  The sentence for the indecent assault was entirely subsumed and had no operative effect.   There was no submission that the degree to which the sentences for the aggravated sexual offences were partially accumulated was beyond the proper exercise of the judge's discretion.  
59As a result, and notwithstanding the various favourable aspects of the applicant's subjective case, even if there was error, I am not of the view that any lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act.
Extension of time
60The applicant was sentenced on 30 October 2009 but did not file a notice of application for leave to appeal until November 2011.  An extension of time is sought.  Considerable documentation annexed to an affidavit by the applicant's solicitor was placed before the Court in an endeavour to explain the delay.
61However, Mr Wendler, counsel for the applicant, conceded that if the grounds of appeal were found to have no merit, then the Court should refuse the application for an extension of time (T2.30).  In those circumstances, there is no point in setting out the detail of the attempt to explain the delay except to record that I found much of it remains unexplained.  Mr Wendler's concession should be accepted. 
R v Unger
62I wish to add something to my judgment after having had the opportunity to read in draft the judgment of Leeming JA.  Reference to Unger arose in the course of oral submissions by Mr Wendler on behalf of the applicant.  The Crown did not rely upon Unger but based its submissions on the extension of time issue upon more general authorities: R v Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122 at 148; Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [8]; and Arja v R [2010] NSWCCA 190 at [4].
63In relation to the effect of Muldrock upon sentencing for standard non-parole period offences, the Crown confined its reliance to decisions of this Court dealing with that specific issue: for example, Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23.  The point raised in the judgment of Leeming JA, with reference to Unger, was not raised in Butler; nor has it been raised in any of the many other cases in this Court concerned with asserted ""Muldrock error"" in appeals out of time.
64I prefer to express no concluded view on the Unger point as the Court has not had the benefit of full argument and, in any event, it is unnecessary to do so for the resolution of this application.
Conclusion
65Neither of the two proposed grounds of appeal should be upheld.  In any event, no lesser sentence was warranted in all of the circumstances of the case.  The application to extend time should be refused.
Order
66I propose the following order:
Extension of time in which to file a notice of application for leave to appeal against sentence is refused.
67BUTTON J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.

2706145,R v GD [2013] NSWCCA 212,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: I agree with Button J.

2R A HULME J: I agree with Button J.

3BUTTON J: This is a Crown appeal brought pursuant to s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 founded upon the failure of the respondent to provide foreshadowed assistance that led to a reduction in the sentence imposed upon him. There is no dispute between the parties that the sentence to which the respondent is currently subject must be quashed and increased; the only question is as to the amount of that increase.

4In light of the circumscribed area of dispute, there is no need for me to recount the background in detail, especially with regard to subjective features. However, in light of the subject matter of the controversy, and the fact that this judgment will appear upon the internet, I consider that it is preferable that persons be referred to by pseudonyms.

Offence and trial

5On 11 August 2009, the respondent was one of two men who took part in a home invasion. In the early hours of the morning, the respondent and an unknown co-offender entered the suburban home of Mr Clissold. The respondent held a knife to the throat of the victim. A threat was made that his throat would be slit if he did not comply with the demands of the offenders. In an ensuing struggle, the victim was injured in various ways, including by way of a serious cut to his finger. The offenders demanded money, and eventually located over $15,000 cash in the home. They also made a demand that $100,000 be provided subsequently. They made threats to kill the daughters of the victim and to burn down his house. Finally, ropes and leather straps were produced, and used to ""hogtie"" the victim. It was in that state that the offenders left him: incapacitated; injured; terrified.

6During the following days, the victim received calls on his mobile phone from various parties and demands for the provision of the $100,000 were made. Shortly thereafter, the respondent was arrested and charged and, after some prevarication, exercised his right to silence.

7On 29 August 2011, the respondent was arraigned at his trial in the District Court on an indictment that contained two counts.

8The first averred breaking, entering and stealing and committing a serious indictable offence (larceny) in circumstances of special aggravation; namely, depriving the victim of his liberty and also wounding him. Pursuant to s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900, the applicable maximum penalty for that offence was imprisonment for 25 years. There was also an applicable standard non-parole period of 7 years.

9The second count averred that, between 10 and 15 August 2009, the respondent demanded $100,000 of the victim with menaces and with intent to steal. That count was brought pursuant to s 99(1) of the Crimes Act, and carried with it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.

Plea and sentence

10On the third day of his trial, and at a point when the Crown case was just about to close, the respondent after negotiation pleaded guilty to the first count. The second count was placed on a Form 1 pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The matter was stood over for sentence. 

11On 1 September 2011, the respondent engaged in a very lengthy recorded interview with police. During it, he claimed that three other males were involved in the offence, and named two of them. I shall refer to them as Mr Longsworth, who was a juvenile, and Mr Needham.

12On 19 October 2011, the respondent signed a statement to the effect that the recorded interview was correct, and that he was prepared to give evidence in accordance with it. 

13On 4 November 2011, the respondent was sentenced. There was a controversy about the value of the assistance given and to be given by the respondent, chiefly between the Crown Prosector then appearing and the police.

14The subjective evidence showed that the respondent was aged 48 as at the date of sentence. He had a criminal record but it was not significant. He was running a café at the time of the offences, but that had subsequently been closed. His partner, with whom he enjoyed a good relationship, had given birth to a baby shortly before the imposition of sentence. 

15In the remarks on sentence, the learned sentencing Judge made a number of findings that are relevant to this appeal. I shall extract them in the order in which they appear in the remarks on sentence.

16With reference to the offence on the indictment, his Honour noted that it was a situation of ""the offender having belatedly pleaded guilty to that offence."" A little later his Honour said ""[a]s I said, this plea of guilty came very late indeed, it was on the third day of the offender's trial when the Crown case was about to close.""

17With regard to assistance, his Honour said:

""[a]nother reason that the sentencing proceedings have been a bit delayed concerns the question of assistance to the authorities. Today I received an affidavit and annexed to that affidavit is a statement of the officer-in-charge of this matter. It concerns information given to the authorities by the offender after he pleaded guilty. He has promised to give evidence against one person whom the police believe was involved in the offence and who has been charged with it, and he has also promised to give evidence against others. On top of that, the assistance has allowed police to identify a criminal network. There was some controversy between the Crown and counsel for the offender as to the value of the assistance. Indeed there seems to have been some controversy between the Crown and the police officer as to the value of that assistance and so the police officer was called to give evidence. It may well be that in some respects what the offender has told police contradicts other evidence. But simply because that weakens the Crown case against someone does not mean that the assistance is not valuable. Assisting the authorities does not just mean making a Crown case stronger. If, in truth, the Crown case is based on a misunderstanding then it is of assistance to the authorities if the offender tells the truth and exposes the misunderstanding.""

18Immediately after that, his Honour said:

""I will not separately quantify the discount that I have allowed for assistance to the authorities from the discount that I have allowed for the very late plea of guilty. I repeat, as I have said many times now, the plea of guilty came almost at the end of the Crown case, and so the utilitarian value of that plea is very limited indeed, it saved perhaps a day or two of Court time but that is about it.""

19Thereafter, his Honour said:

""Combining the discounts for the late plea of guilty and the assistance I will impose upon the offender a sentence which is 25 per cent less than it would otherwise have been. Of course one of the factors that is encompassed by that discount is the possibility that the offender will serve part or all of his sentence in protective custody, which carries with it the risk that his conditions of custody will be harder than those in the general prison population. Another thing that will make the offender's time in gaol harder is the circumstance that he will be deprived of being able to live with his wife and new child. His behaviour in Court has clearly suggested that this will be a matter of some significance to him. The offender will also know that through his criminal behaviour he has deprived his wife and new child of his care and support for a number of years.""

20For the single count on the indictment, and having applied that global discount of 25 per cent, his Honour imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years. It can be seen that special circumstances were found and the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence is 61 per cent. 

Subsequent events

21On 12 September 2012, in the proceedings against Mr Longsworth in the Children's Court, the respondent did not come up to proof. The learned Magistrate said in her Honour's reasons for discharging Mr Longsworth ""I found [the respondent] to be a completely unreliable witness."" 

22In the committal proceedings with regard to Mr Needham on 18 February 2013, the respondent said ""I changed my plea in court, okay, to stay out for the birth of my baby, right and to stay at home."" A little later, after leave had been granted to the Prosecutor to cross-examine the respondent under s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995, the respondent said ""I gave them what they needed to hear so I could go see the birth of my baby and so get a better time with my family.""

23In her Honour's reasons for dismissing the proceedings against Mr Needham, her Honour said ""[t]he evidence today from [the respondent] was extremely unhelpful to the prosecution case. He basically reneged on any evidence he had given before.""

24As one might expect, those events led to the Crown appeal.

Crown submissions in this Court 

25The Crown submitted that it was an error for the learned sentencing Judge not to quantify with specificity the discounts that were being provided for past and future assistance. That is because the amendments to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act calling upon sentencing judges to undertake that exercise commenced on 14 March 2011. The sentence was imposed on 4 November 2011. The transitional provision contained in Sch 2 [62] of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is to the effect that the new version of s 23 was to have prospective operation.

26The Crown submitted that, in those circumstances, it is necessary for this Court to ascertain the separate components of the global 25 per cent discount that was provided, and then to increase the sentence in order to reflect the failure to provide the promised assistance that was taken into account at first instance.

27With regard to the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, the Crown submitted that the discount would, in the circumstances, have been less than 10 per cent.

28The Crown did not make submissions as to whether or not the remaining component of the discount of more than 15 per cent should be regarded as having been divided between past assistance and future assistance.

29The Crown submitted in short that the correct approach for this Court to adopt would be to remove the 25 per cent discount that had been applied by his Honour, thereby returning to the starting point. Thereafter, this Court should deduct 10 per cent or less from that starting point to reflect the discount for the plea of guilty, and impose the resultant sentence.

Submissions of the respondent

30As I have indicated, the respondent did not dispute that the Crown appeal must be allowed and the sentence increased. However, there was controversy as to the precise amount of that increase. The respondent made three submissions contrary to the approach of the Crown.

31First, the respondent submitted that, in analysing the components of the global 25 per cent discount, one cannot rule out the possibility that his Honour provided a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty of 10 per cent, and that any uncertainty about it should be resolved in favour of the respondent. 

32Secondly, it was submitted that some of the remaining discount was founded upon past assistance, in light of the comments in the portion of the remarks on sentence that I have extracted at [17].

33Thirdly, it was submitted that another component of the global discount was the hardship accruing to the respondent and his wife and child from the fact of his being in custody. That was founded upon the extract from the remarks on sentence that I have provided at [19].

34As a result of those three aspects of the matter, all of which constitute discrete discounts that should not be removed as a result of this circumscribed appeal, it was submitted that the correct approach would be to reapply the 25 per cent discount (to arrive at the notional starting point of his Honour), but then deduct a substantial proportion of 25 per cent from that starting point in order to achieve the appropriate new sentence.

Determination

35Section 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act is as follows:

""5DA Appeal by Crown against reduced sentence for assistance to authorities

(1) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence imposed on a person that was reduced because the person undertook to assist law enforcement authorities if the person fails wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking.

(2) On an appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal may, if it is satisfied that the person has failed wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking, vary the sentence and impose such sentence as it thinks fit.

(3) A reference in subsection (1) to a sentence imposed on a person includes a reference to a sentence that was varied or imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal.""

36Since 14 March 2011, s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act has relevantly been as follows:

""23 Power to reduce penalties for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities

(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.

...

(4) A court that imposes a lesser penalty under this section on an offender because the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities must: 

(a) indicate to the offender, and make a record of the fact, that the lesser penalty is being imposed for either or both of those reasons, and

(b) state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed, and

(c) where the lesser penalty is being imposed for both reasons-state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason.

(5) Subsection (4) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(6) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (4) with respect to any sentence does not invalidate the sentence.""

37Considering the portions of the remarks on sentence that I have extracted as a whole, I am of the opinion that it is tolerably clear that his Honour was imposing a lesser sentence for both past and future assistance. I refer especially to what his Honour said about the identification of a criminal network, and the identification of weaknesses or errors in the Crown case against others. 

38In those circumstances, I respectfully agree that, pursuant to s 23(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it was incumbent upon his Honour to quantify the discounts for past and future assistance: see LB v R [2013] NSWCCA 70. Unfortunately, neither party at first instance reminded his Honour of the legislation that had commenced months before, and that had effected a significant change to sentencing practice.

39The result is that this Court must attempt to construe the various components of the global discount provided by his Honour in order to determine this appeal. To the extent that that exercise may be impossible to achieve with complete accuracy, I consider that this Court should make its own assessment.

40Turning first to the discrete discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, in light of the lateness of the plea, its very limited utilitarian benefit, and the repeated emphasis given to those matters by his Honour, I consider that the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty could not have been more than 5 per cent.

41Turning to past assistance, it is true that, with the benefit of hindsight, it appears that that assistance was very likely worthless, in light of subsequent events that destroyed the credibility of the respondent. And it is clear from the terms of s 5DA(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act, that, if an appeal pursuant to the section is upheld, this Court is not limited merely to reapplying the discount that was given for an unfulfilled promise with regard to future assistance. This Court many resentence ""as it thinks fit"". That state of affairs argues for this Court applying no discount for past assistance, since it could be said that the subsequent behaviour of the respondent has shown the true value of the assistance given before the imposition of sentence.

42However, it is not completely clear that the past assistance was of no value whatsoever. While the credibility of the respondent has been rendered nugatory, the identification of a criminal network may well have had some intrinsic benefit. The Crown did not place evidence before this Court to demonstrate that that aspect of the past assistance of the respondent must be assessed as worthless. 

43In those circumstances, I consider that this Court should assess the discount given by the learned sentencing Judge to the respondent with regard to past assistance, rather than imposing a new sentence that provides no reflection of it. 

44His Honour assessed the past assistance as having some utility. As I have said, his Honour was of the view that a criminal network had been identified, and that the material provided by the respondent had the potential to help identify (and perhaps repair) the weaknesses in the Crown case against the purported co-offenders. 

45But the value of that past assistance could hardly compare to the proposed future assistance of giving evidence founded upon a lengthy recorded interview against two alleged co-offenders with regard to a very grave offence. In short, I consider that this Court should regard the discount that was provided for past assistance as being 5 per cent.

46Finally, I respectfully reject the submission of the respondent that some discrete component of the discount was founded upon hardship to the respondent or his family. My rejection of that submission has two bases. 

47The first is that, in light of the seriousness of the offence, it was inevitable that the respondent would be sentenced to full-time custody in any event. In other words, the intrinsic hardship to the respondent and his family of him being incarcerated had nothing to do with his assistance to the authorities. Secondly, as his Honour made clear in the second sentence of the portion of the remarks on sentence extracted by me at [19], the hardship arising from his conditions of custody as a result of his assistance to the authorities was reflected in the discount given for past and future assistance. It was not the subject of a separate discount. That is entirely consonant with established sentencing practice: see R v Perez-Vargas & Stevens (1986) 8 NSWLR 559; (1986) 25 A Crim R 194 and R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220. 

48In summary, I consider that the global discount provided by his Honour was founded on the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty (5 per cent), the past assistance (5 per cent), and the future assistance (15 per cent). I do not consider that any aspect of the incarceration of the respondent gave rise to a separate discount that should be factored into the new sentence to be imposed. 

49It follows that I assess the component of the global discount referable to future assistance as being 15 per cent. It is that discount that must now be removed from the sentence imposed by his Honour. The correct mathematical approach is as follows.

50First, remove the 25 per cent discount from the imposed head sentence of imprisonment for 6 years 6 months and the non-parole period of 4 years, arriving at a starting point of a head sentence of imprisonment for 8 years 8 months.

51Secondly, apply a 10 per cent discount (made up of the 5 per cent discount for the plea of guilty and the 5 per cent discount for past assistance at the time of the sentence) to that starting point. That calculation results in a discounted head sentence of imprisonment for 7 years 9 months.

52Thirdly, impose a new non-parole period that replicates the ratio between the head sentence and non-parole period of 61 per cent created by his Honour. That leads to a new non-parole period of 4 years 9 months. 

Orders

53I propose the following orders:

(1)Crown appeal allowed.

(2)Sentence imposed in the District Court on 4 November 2011 quashed.

(3)On the single count on the indictment and taking into account the charge on the Form 1, the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months with a balance of term of 3 years. The sentence is to date from 18 October 2011. The non-parole period expires on 17 July 2016 and the total term expires on 17 July 2019.

(4)The offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 17 July 2016.

		16 September 2013",2013-09-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706151,R v Sio (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1413,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1A further application has been made on behalf of the accused for the issue of a subpoena to have Mr Richard Filihia attend Court to give evidence on behalf of the accused and be subject to cross-examination by the Crown. Mr Filihia is the person who committed the armed robbery in the course of which Brian Gaudry died. He has pleaded guilty to murder and armed robbery with wounding. The accused is charged with murder on the basis that he was party to a joint criminal enterprise with Mr Filihia to commit armed robbery or that he was an accessory before the fact to the armed robbery. He is also charged with armed robbery with wounding. It is common ground both that Mr Filihia entered the brothel with a knife and killed Brian Gaudry and that the accused was outside in his motor vehicle and did not enter the brothel in the course of that incident.
2Last Monday the Crown submitted on a voir dire that Mr Filihia was unavailable within the meaning of clause 4 of Part 2 of the Dictionary of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act).  The Crown sought to tender his ERISP interviews and statements on that basis.  I acceded to that application: R v Sio [2013] NSWSC 1412.
3Last week Mr Watson, who appears on behalf of the accused, sought leave to issue a subpoena to have Mr Filihia come to Court.  I was not satisfied that Mr Filihia's position, which he had made clear to me in person last Monday on the voir dire and also last Wednesday, in the presence of the jury, had changed.  However, in support of the further application Mr Watson has read the affidavit of his instructing solicitor, Ms Vanya Hampel. 
4In her affidavit Ms Hampel deposed that she attended Nowra gaol on 17 March 2013 and was told certain things by Mr Filihia which caused her to believe that it would be beneficial to the accused for Mr Filihia to attend Court and give evidence.  Importantly, for present purposes, Ms Hampel also deposed that she was informed by Mr Filihia on 12 September 2013 in the cells at the Court that he is willing to be subpoenaed to give evidence on behalf of the accused and that he understands that he will also be subject to cross-examination by the Crown.  Mr Filihia explained to Ms Hampel on that occasion that he was prepared to be called as a defence witness but not as a Crown witness due to what he understood to be the potential consequences of other inmates finding out he was a Crown witness. 
5I have no reason to doubt what Ms Hampel has said and, in any event, her evidence has not been, and probably could not be, challenged in cross-examination.  Nonetheless, I am not satisfied that there is any reason to consider that Mr Filihia has changed his attitude since last week.  He may well not appreciate that if he were to give evidence for the accused he would only be permitted to answer non-leading questions from Mr Watson and that he would be required to answer all questions asked of him in cross-examination by the Crown, including leading questions and questions relevant to his credibility.  
6I am concerned that there would be a substantial risk, were I to accede to this application, that Mr Filihia would answer questions from Mr Watson and then refuse to answer questions in cross-examination by the Crown.  Mr Watson fairly and properly conceded that that was a risk which could give rise to the trial miscarrying, if this scenario came to pass in the presence of the jury.  
7In all the circumstances I am not disposed to revisit the question of the issue of the subpoena unless the risk of the trial miscarrying can be appropriately mitigated.
8I consider that the risk can be mitigated, if not obviated, by my making an order under s 77 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 that requires Mr Filihia to be brought to Court tomorrow. I propose to permit Mr Watson to examine him on the voir dire. Mr Crown will then be permitted to cross-examine him, also on the voir dire. In that way, I can determine whether Ms Hampel's belief that Mr Filihia is prepared not only to give evidence for the accused but also to answer questions asked of him in cross-examination by the Crown is well-founded.
Order
9I make an order under s 77 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 that Richard Filihia attend Court on 17 September 2013 to give evidence.

		24 September 2013",2013-09-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706152,R v Kearnes [2013] NSWSC 1395,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1The question has arisen whether manslaughter, in this trial for murder, should be left to the jury for their consideration in my summing-up.

2The position of the Crown Prosecutor is that manslaughter should not be left, and he has not addressed the jury upon it whatsoever. The position of defence counsel is, on reflection, identical; namely, that manslaughter should not be left, and no submissions with regard to the topic were made in the final address to the jury of defence counsel.

3It is well known that the position of the parties is significant but not determinative with regard to the question under consideration: see R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; (2005) 64 NSWLR 527 at [75].

Background

4The Crown case is that, in the early hours of 21 July 2011, the accused with an associate named Christopher Paton travelled in a motor vehicle from Tumut to Wagga Wagga. Previous to that it is alleged that the accused was seen at his home with a sawn off rifle, some ammunition, and was heard to say words to the effect of, ""I'm going to kill the fucking paedophile."" It is alleged that that witness was asked to monitor a police scanner whilst the accused and Mr Paton were away from the home.

5At Wagga Wagga the deceased was shot in the head and neck a number of times, and his body mutilated. 

6The Crown case is that the accused was either the shooter, and therefore a principal in the first degree, or a principal in the first degree pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise and his presence at the scene: see Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316 and Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6.

7It was convenient for that principal in the first degree based upon joint criminal enterprise, as opposed to acts committed by that individual, to be referred to throughout the trial and with the jury as ""the accessory"".

8To be clear, the Crown case is that each man was at the scene pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise to kill, and that each man possessed his own intention to kill.

9The defence case is that the accused was not at the scene, not involved in the shooting, but that the accused is unable to recall what he was doing or indeed where he was.

10It can be seen therefore that the Crown case is that the accused was at the scene and intended to kill, whether he was the shooter or not. In sharp contrast, the defence case is that the accused was not at the scene and had nothing to do with the shooting. 

Determination

11It is certainly true that the Court of Criminal Appeal of this State and the High Court of Australia have called upon trial judges to err on the side of caution with regard to this issue: see, for example, Carney v R; Cambey v R [2013] NSWCCA 223. That is especially so in cases, as here, where the Crown case is founded, at least in part, on accessorial liability: see Gillard v The Queen [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1 and The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38. 

12It is possible to construct a hypothesis whereby the accessory is guilty of manslaughter, not murder. For example, one could imagine a scenario whereby the two men travelled to Wagga Wagga with an intention of performing an unlawful and dangerous act, namely frightening or threatening the deceased with a loaded firearm, but the principle went further and formed an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, states of mind that the accessory had not foreseen as possibilities, and thereafter the principal shot and killed the deceased.

13It is possible to construct or imagine such a scenario. But it is thoroughly divorced from the evidence and the issues in this trial.

14A test for leaving manslaughter to a jury's consideration can be summarised as being whether or not such a verdict is ""viable"" on the evidence in the trial: see Gillard v The Queen at [6], R v Kanaan at [75] and Carney v R; Cambey v R at [22]. It is noteworthy that the Crown case places no reliance at all on extended joint criminal enterprise or what used to be called ""common purpose"": see Johns v The Queen [1980] HCA 3; (1980) 143 CLR 108 and McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; (1995) 183 CLR 108

15I repeat that the Crown case is simply that the accused was either the shooter or the accessory, and either way he was present with an intention to kill.

16I also emphasise that the defence case is that he was simply not at the scene (although he is not sure where he actually was) and had nothing to do with the shooting.

17On the evidence in this trial, I consider that manslaughter is unviable. There is nothing in the prosecution or defence evidence or submissions to support, or even faintly to suggest, the scenario that I posited a moment ago, or a similar scenario.

18I interpolate to say that that there were perhaps submissions made briefly by defence counsel to the effect that perhaps Mr Paton had committed the shooting on his own. But of course that gives rise to entirely separate issues, and if that were the case the accused would be entitled to be acquitted entirely, and not found guilty of manslaughter.

19On the evidence and issues in this trial I consider that leaving manslaughter for consideration of the jury would only serve to confuse them thoroughly. Indeed, I think it would mystify them: see The Queen v Chai [2002] HCA 12; (2002) 128 A Crim R 101 at [18]. 

20It follows that, although I have borne in mind that I must approach this issue by erring on the side of caution, I do not propose to leave manslaughter to the jury.

2706166,The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Cranney [2013] NSWSC 1357,"Judgment

1This is an application under s 17 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 of the Commonwealth seeking restraining orders of the property more particularly dealt with in the schedule to the Summons. The application is supported by an affidavit of Adrian Edwards sworn 16 September 2013. 

2Section 17 requires the Court to make an order under the section if a Proceeds of Crime Authority applies for the order, if the person concerned has been charged with or convicted of an indictable offence, if the affidavit requirements in the section have been complied with and if the Court is satisfied that the authorised officer who makes the affidavit holds the suspicions stated in the affidavit on reasonable grounds.

3The applicant is a Proceeds of Crime Authority. I am satisfied from the supporting affidavit that Mr Edwards is an authorised officer within the meaning of s 338 of the Act. 

4The affidavit discloses that the Defendant has been charged with three counts against s 307.11 (1) of the Criminal Code and three counts against s 141.1 (3) of the Criminal Code. Each of these offences is a serious offence as that term is defined in s 338. 

5The affidavit further discloses that Mr Edwards suspects that the Defendant has committed the indictable offences of conspiring to import a commercial quantity of border controlled pre-cursors known as pseudo ephedrine on a number of occasions, and three charges of receiving a bribe, that is, dishonestly asking for a benefit for himself with the intention within the exercise of his duties as a Commonwealth public official would be influenced contrary to s 1.1.13 of the Criminal Code. The affidavit has exhibited a number of Statements of Facts in relation to the alleged commission of the offences. 

6I am satisfied that the affidavit requirements have been complied with.

7The suspicion that Mr Edwards holds is based upon conversations he has had with the persons who prepared those Statements of Facts, and Mr Edwards reading those facts. 

8I am satisfied that Mr Edwards holds the suspicions that are set out in his affidavit on reasonable grounds. In reaching that view, I have myself perused the statements of facts that form the exhibit to his affidavit. 

9The Applicant asks that this application be heard without notice being given to the Defendant. Pursuant to s 26 (4) of the Act the Court is required to consider the application without notice if the responsible authority requests the Court to do so. 

10Accordingly, I make orders in terms of paragraphs 1,2,3 and 4 of the draft order and stand the proceedings over to the Registrar's list on Friday 11 October 2013. Liberty to restore on 3 days' notice. Costs reserved.

		20 September 2013",2013-09-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706174,Application by Frank Sinkovich pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 1342,"DECISION
1The applicant, Frank Sinkovich, applies to the Court pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the Act) for an inquiry into his sentence following his conviction after trial on two drug offences.  The applicant submits that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in his case that warrants the referral of the sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
2Sections 78 and 79 in Part 7 (Review of convictions and sentences) of the Act provide :-78 (1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.
79 (1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion: (a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or (b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

3In November 2009, the applicant was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, including a non-parole period of two years, for the offence of knowingly take part in the supply of methylamphetamine.  He was sentenced to thirteen years' imprisonment, including a non-parole period of nine years, for the offence of supply a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (count 2 on the indictment).  The latter offence carries a standard non-parole period of ten years.
4The aggregate sentence was one of fourteen years, including an aggregate non-parole period of ten years.
5The applicant sought leave to appeal against sentence on the grounds that the sentences were individually and in the aggregate manifestly excessive, and on the ground of disparity.  On 15 April 2011, the applicant's appeal was dismissed : Sinkovich v R [2011] NSWCCA 90.
6In October 2011, the High Court delivered judgment in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120.  In the light of the High Court's disapproval of R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, the present application is based upon the imposition of sentence in accordance with the approach to the standard non-parole period previously established by the Court in Way, and the disposition of the applicant's appeal by the Court of Criminal Appeal consistent with Way.  The applicant maintains that an erroneous approach to the assessment of an appropriate sentence, notwithstanding compliance with authority as it existed at sentence and on appeal, raises a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the case : s 79 of the Act.
7The findings made by the sentencing judge for the purposes of the offence carrying the standard non-parole period were set out in the course of Hoeben J's judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal :-
17 In relation to count 2, his Honour noted that a standard non-parole period of 10 years applied and that s54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act , 1999 (the Act) required that a Court set the standard non-parole fixed for the offence unless the Court determined that there were reasons for setting a non-parole period which was either longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. By reference to R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 his Honour noted that where a standard non-parole period applied to an offence, one had to ask whether reasons existed for not imposing it. As a first step, it was necessary to assess the objective seriousness of the offence to determine whether it fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of the relevant kind. Such a determination would include a consideration of the applicable circumstances of aggravation and mitigation provided for in s21A(2) and s21A(3) of the Act. 18 In relation to the objective seriousness of the offence in count 2, his Honour said: ""... I am satisfied as I have already indicated that it involved a considerable degree of planning. First there were those negotiations between Lowe and the UCO in respect of the purchase price and the timeframe when the delivery could be made. The offender was the go to man for the supply of the commercial quantity. It involved this offender organising for the supply and collection of the commercial quantity and then organising its supply to Lowe so that he could on-supply it to the UCO. A driver had to be organised to take Lowe and Tutton to the Sweetenham Road location. A large sum of money changed hands. The amount supplied was almost twice the prescribed commercial quantity (250 grams). The offender Sinkovich waited at Lowe's premises while the transaction was going down. My assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence, so far as this offender is concerned, is that it falls slightly above the midrange."" (ROS 6.1) 19 In assessing the objective seriousness of the count 2 offence, his Honour also took into account under s21A(3) of the Act, that the applicant did not have any significant history of criminal offending and that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour did note, however, that no remorse had been exhibited and that despite an overwhelming prosecution case, he continued to deny his guilt. 
8On the hearing of the appeal, the applicant challenged the sentencing judge's finding in relation to the objective gravity of count 2.  The Court (Hoeben J, Macfarlan JA and Garling J agreeing) said in response to these submissions :-
50 Moreover, the applicant's submissions are silent as to the effect of the standard non-parole period of 10 years applicable in respect of the offence in count 2 and the applicant's relatively modest subjective case. 51 Once it is accepted that his Honour was entitled to assess the objective seriousness of the offence, at or slightly above the mid-range for offences of this kind, s54B of the Act requires that the standard non-parole period be applied unless the Court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period which is either longer or shorter than that fixed for the offence. Howie J referred to this issue in Davis v R [2009] NSWCCA 279 at [21]: ""One of the problems with statistics in cases where the standard non-parole period applies is that they tend to suggest that the standard non-parole period is being largely disregarded. If an offence is within midrange of seriousness and there is no reason to reduce the standard non-parole period, then the appropriate sentence is the standard non-parole period whatever the sentencing statistics might reveal."" 

The Submissions of the Parties
9It is patently clear from these extracts that the applicant's submissions on this application are well-founded, to the extent that the sentencing judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal applied sentencing principles that have since been discredited.  The Attorney General takes no issue with this aspect of the application.  However, the Attorney General does take issue with the proposition that the change in sentencing practice brought about by the High Court's decision in Muldrock is capable of meeting the criteria in s 79.  In other words, the Attorney General contends that an error of this type does not constitute a ""mitigating circumstance"".
10The relevant mitigating circumstance identified by the applicant is ""the possibility that had proper sentencing principles been applied ....  the resulting sentence would have been markedly less than that actually imposed."" In particular, reliance is placed upon Kirby J's judgment in Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 37 - 38 wherein his Honour said of the predecessor to s 79 :-
It should, in my view, be given a beneficial construction and one which furthers and does not frustrate the purpose evident in the legislation. This purpose is the safeguarding of the administration of justice and the assurance that, to the extent that our legal procedures permit it, no person shall suffer the stigma of a conviction, still less the burden of continuing deprivation of liberty or the imposition of other sanctions, where a doubt or question has arisen as to his guilt or as to evidence upon which he has been convicted. These are, after all, very serious concerns. The law must put a high store on finality, especially in criminal trials. It must uphold the decisions of the juries and of courts, duly arrived at. But it must also attend sensitively to the correction of errors where they can be demonstrated. Section 475 affords a legislative warrant to the Executive Government and the Court in certain limited circumstances, to require a review of a conviction although duly entered. Such a provision should not be given an unduly narrow construction by adopting an approach to the initiation of proceedings which tends to impede their commencement. (italics not in original)
11The applicant points out that Varley was referred to with approval by Heydon J (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ agreeing) in Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) (2003) 214 CLR 318.
12In Eastman, McHugh J described the predecessor to s 79 in these terms (at 324)  :-
Section 475 can be seen as intended to authorise the Executive Government to inform itself of possible miscarriages of justice resulting from deficiencies in the evidence adduced at the trial. The section left it to the Executive Government to determine whether any actual or suspected miscarriages of justice had occurred. It also left to the discretion of the Executive Government what steps should be taken to remedy any actual or suspected miscarriage of justice.
13The applicant maintains that a referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal was made in similar circumstances to this application in Yin v R [2007] NSWCCA 350.  The mitigating circumstance in that case was said to be the reduction on appeal of a co-offender's sentence after the offender had been unsuccessful in appealing the severity of his sentence.  It appears that Barr J referred Yin's matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the basis that a parity ground had been enlivened after Yin's appeal against sentence had been determined.   However, the Attorney General points out that a change in the evidence in the case on sentence (the emergence of apparently disparate sentences) underpinned the application in Yin, not legal error.
14The applicant further contends that the recommendation of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission (Sentencing; Interim Report on Standard Minimum Non-Parole Periods, Report 134 (2012)) that the use of Part 7 as a mechanism for the review of cases, where there was a doubt or question as to the sentence arising from the misapplication of the standard non-parole period scheme, as interpreted by Muldrock, ought be followed, subject to one qualification.  That qualification is that the referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal ought not be determined on the basis that no lesser sentence is warranted in law. The applicant submits that the only criteria for referral is whether a doubt or question arises as to the sentence imposed, and that any consideration of whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law is to be undertaken by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I accept the latter submission.

15It is also submitted that the failure on the part of the applicant to exhaust his appeal rights to the High Court should not stand in the way of this application, given the impracticability of that course.  
16The Attorney General's response to the applicant's argument presents a powerful case for a construction of Part 7 that confines applications under s 78 to the correction of factual, not legal error.  
17The authorities upon which the applicant relies, including White v The King (1906) 4 CLR (Pt 1) 152, Varley and Eastman all refer to deficiencies in the evidence, or facts which come to the notice of the Crown after conviction, suggesting that there had been a miscarriage of justice.  To the same effect is Johnson J's decision in Application of Peter Holland [2008] NSWSC 251 at [10].  The NSW Law Reform Commission's recommendation in Report 134 was made without a detailed consideration of the scope of Part 7.
18The Attorney General also calls in aid the principle of finality as a ""central and pervading tenet of the judicial system"" : D'Orta Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid (2005) 223 CLR 1 at 17.  It must be acknowledged that in the criminal law, that principle is qualified by the appellate system :-The principal qualification to the general principle that controversies, once quelled, may not be reopened is provided by the appellate system. But even there, the importance of finality pervades the law. Restraints on the nature and availability of appeals, rules about what points may be taken on appeal and rules about when further evidence may be called in an appeal (in particular, the so-called ""fresh evidence rule"") are all rules based on the need for finality. As was said in the joint reasons in Coulton v Holcombe: ""[i]t is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial"".  (citations omitted)D'Orta at 17 - 18.)
19The existence of the procedure under Part 7 of the Act should also be regarded as a qualification to the principle of finality with respect to convictions and sentence matters, but to what extent ?
20By way of answer to that question, the Attorney General submits that the principle of finality forms part of the general system of law for the purposes of the application of the rules of statutory construction.  The Attorney General relies upon the following dicta by Hayne and Bell JJ (Kiefel J agreeing) in X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29 at [86] and [87] :-
The question of statutory construction which arises in this case requires the consideration and application of a well-established rule. That rule, often since applied, was stated by O'Connor J in Potter v Minahan by quoting Maxwell's On the Interpretation of Statutes :""It is in the last degree improbable that the legislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness ; and to give any such effect to general words, simply because they have that meaning in their widest, or usual, or natural sense, would be to give them a meaning in which they were not really used."" (emphasis added)This rule of construction has found most frequent application in this Court with respect to legislation which may affect rights. In that context, it has come to be referred to as a ""principle of legality"" : But the rule is not confined to legislation which may affect rights. It is engaged in the present case because of the effects which the asserted construction of the ACC Act provisions authorising compulsory examination would have not only on the rights, privileges and immunities of a person charged with an indictable Commonwealth offence, but also on a defining characteristic of the criminal justice system. In particular, it would alter to a marked degree the accusatorial nature of the criminal justice system. To hold that the general words of the relevant provisions of the ACC Act authorise compulsory examination of a person charged with an indictable Commonwealth offence about the subject matter of the offence charged would thus depart in a marked degree from the ""general system of law"". 

21Whilst acknowledging that Part 7 is remedial and should be interpreted beneficially, the Attorney General maintains that if the legislature intended that Part 7 displace the principles of finality, merger and res judicata where errors of law are concerned, it would have expressed its intention clearly. It is accepted that Part 7 displaces the principle of finality where errors of fact are concerned.  
22An applicant under the section cannot determine the outcome of the application, that is, whether there is an inquiry by a judicial officer or a referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It is therefore submitted that the restriction of the mechanism under s 78 to an application for an inquiry is suggestive of the centrality of the availability of new evidence, rather than a consideration of the possibility of legal error. 
Resolution
23The construction of ""mitigating circumstances"" in s 79(2) cannot, in my view, be strained to accommodate errors of law.  I have reached that conclusion for the following reasons.
24Section 79 has remained largely unchanged since the introduction of its predecessor in NSW in the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1883.  Section 383 of that Act provided that :-
Whenever after the conviction of a prisoner any doubt orquestion arises as to his guilt or any mitigating circumstance in thecase or any portion of the evidence therein it shall be lawful for anyJustice by direction of the Governor on the petition of the prisoner or some person on his behalf representing such doubt or question-or by direction of a Judge of the Supreme Court of his own motion-to summon and examine on oath all persons likely to give material information on the matter suggested.  
25In this original provision, the doubt or question (admittedly a low threshold : Eastman per Heydon J at [134]) arises either as to the guilt of the applicant or as to any mitigating circumstance or as to any part of the evidence in the case.  The disjunctive indicates that the legislature always envisaged the availability of an inquiry into guilt or sentence.  In other words, the reference to ""mitigating circumstance"" distinguishes matters capable of compromising guilt from matters capable of mitigating the penalty.  Section 383 was re-enacted largely unchanged in the Crimes Act 1900 as s 475.  These versions of the provision simply grounded the application as one made ""after conviction"". 
26In late 1993, Part 13A was introduced in lieu of s 475.  For the first time, the procedure was framed in terms of an inquiry ""into a conviction"".  Section 474E changed the relevant criteria to the extent of the omission of ""or"" : that is, ""a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case"". These amendments inadvertently restricted inquiries into convictions only until the position was corrected in 1996 with the Crimes Amendment (Review of Convictions and Sentences) Act, which amended Part 13A by the insertion of the words ""and sentences"" in s 474D of the Crimes Act 1900.   Otherwise, over the life of the various incarnations of s 79, ""mitigating circumstances"" was interpreted as material capable of lessening a person's culpability for the offence (for example, evidence going to provocation, substantial impairment or excessive self-defence) or material providing an alternative basis for leniency (for example, excessive hardship to others affected by the applicant's incarceration, or assistance to authorities not taken into account at sentence).  In such circumstances, a reduction in penalty may be warranted.
27It is clear from the history of the provision and from the applications made to this Court that an inquiry invariably proceeds on the basis of fresh material or additional evidence that casts the conviction and/or the sentence in a different light to that prevailing at first instance or on appeal : see Application of Peter James Holland [2008] NSWSC 251 at [5] to [11] .
28McHugh J in Eastman said as much at 327 :- 
Section 475 as a whole was concerned with what happened at the trial and with new evidence that suggests the prisoner should not have been convicted or that his or her culpability is less than might appear from the conviction.
29In Eastman, McHugh J interpreted ""mitigating circumstances"" in that way (at 326) :-
Mitigating circumstances of the case may cover - indeed ordinarily would cover - matters other than the acts or omissions that constitute the offence. In most cases, that limb would be concerned with evidence that could not be or was not given at the trial. In a murder case, for example, the mitigating circumstances limb might cover matters that were legally irrelevant to the guilt or innocence of that accused. Take a case where a woman was convicted of murder but claimed that, although she was a victim of the ""battered wives syndrome"", the law did not permit her to raise the defence of provocation. The ""mitigating circumstance"" limb of s 475 was wide enough to authorise a direction to take evidence concerning the claim. Similarly, that limb would have authorised a direction to take evidence concerning the diminished responsibility of the accused in the days before the law permitted a jury to use the diminished responsibility of the accused to find manslaughter rather than murder. And there is no reason why such a direction could not have been given after the law recognised diminished responsibility as an ameliorating factor, if it appeared that the accused might have suffered from that condition, whether or not that ""defence"" was raised at the trial. 
30Significantly, McHugh J considered that :-
The power conferred by s 475 did not extend to investigating every possible miscarriage of justice.  It did not, for example, extend to doubts or questions concerning any element of the trial process that might have affected the conviction of the prisoner.  That seems to follow inevitably from the direction to... ""summon and examine on oath all persons likely to give material information .."" ..... Thus, the section would not have authorised a direction concerning the directions of the trial judge. (at 324)
31There have been a limited number of applications for referral or inquiry concerning sentence only : Application of Antoun El Hani [2007] NSWSC 330 ; Yin ; Stevens - Application pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2011] NSWSC 1252 ; The Application of Stevens (unreported, 23 May 2012). One of those applications considered a claim that the judge had committed factual errors in the sentencing process : Stevens [2011].  El Hani and Yin were solely concerned with additional evidence going to the imposition of sentence.
32In The Application of Stevens (unreported, 23 May 2012), Beech-Jones J considered an application based upon disparity with a co-offender, who was sentenced after Stevens and after his appeal against severity to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The Attorney General queried whether the application of the parity principle was a ""mitigating circumstance"" but the point was not decided.  In any event, the matter appears to be on all fours with Yin.
33I am not aware of any application for an inquiry into conviction or sentence that has proceeded solely on the basis that the law, although correctly applied at the time of the relevant proceedings before a court, has changed after the applicant had exhausted his/her appeal rights.  Even before an offender's appeal rights have been exhausted, the principle of finality may play a decisive role in dismissing an appeal or refusing to grant an extension of time within which to file an appeal, where the law has changed between conviction, sentence and appeal.
34Examples of the consideration of the principle of finality in the context of conviction and/or sentence appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal, where an extension of time within which to appeal was necessary, are R v Ramsden [1972] Crim LR 547, R v Unger [1977] 2 NSWLR 990, R v Gregory [2002] NSWCCA 199, Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262 and most recently, Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214 per Leeming JA.   The latter case is pertinent because it concerned an appeal against sentence which was filed out of time and which complained of Muldrock error (in addition to a further ground).  
35Leeming JA said at [2] to [7] :-
There is a further reason for refusing the application for an extension of time. It is well established that a change in the law, even a change whose effect is that a conviction would be quashed on appeal, is not of itself sufficient to warrant the granting of an extension of time in which to appeal. This is an aspect of the principle of finality.That principle was applied in R v Ramsden [1972] Crim LR 547, where a subsequent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal had laid down the law differently from that which had been applied when Mr Ramsden was convicted, yet his application for an extension of time to appeal was refused, notwithstanding that it was assumed that the summing up at his trial was with the benefit of hindsight shown to be defective. This Court applied the same principle in Reg v Unger [1977] 2 NSWLR 990, where the applicant had been convicted of selling Indian hemp pursuant to a provision under the Poisons Act which deemed possession of in excess of a prescribed quantity of a drug of addiction to amount to possession for supply or sale. Street CJ, with whom Begg and Ash JJ agreed, proceeded on the basis that the regulation prescribing the quantity was invalid and had not been validated retrospectively by the remedial legislation (at 996B). The Chief Justice said that there was no taint necessarily introduced into the conviction by reason of the subsequent finding that the regulation on which it depended was invalid. That was a consequence of the doctrine of merger, as explained by Dixon J in Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co Pty Ltd and Meakes v Dignan (1931) 46 CLR 73 at 106 (another conviction permitted to stand notwithstanding it was based upon a disallowed regulation). Gageler J referred to the same doctrine as underpinning the independent legal force possessed by judicial orders in State of NSW v Kable [2013] HCA 26; (2013) 87 ALJR 737 at [53] (another case where a man was imprisoned pursuant to orders which would never have been made had the judges at first instance and on appeal correctly determined that the Community Protection Act 1994 was invalid).It may seem hard for a conviction to be permitted to stand when it is based upon a superseded view of the common law or upon an Act or regulation which has later been held to be invalid. That serves to illustrate the importance of the broader issues which are involved. Street CJ explained the position, in a highly influential passage, as follows (at 995F-996A):""This concept of merger is no blind, arbitrary proposition. It is founded deeply in the fabric of the philosophy of the common law. Although in pure theory the overruling or modification by judicial decision of previous conceptions of legal principle does no more than correct a departure from the timeless perfection of the law, the plain fact is that legal principle is constantly evolving and being moulded in the light of the changing and developing social context. Recognizing this, there has always been an unwillingness to permit the re-opening of past decisions. Indeed the process of appeal, either civil or criminal, is a comparatively recent andstatutory concept - it finds no basis in the common law itself. Thisfinality of decision in each individual case leaves the courts free to permit a judicious flexibility in the development of principle in later cases, free from inhibition lest such development may set at large disputes that have previously been resolved. The concept of merger in judgment, both in the civil and in the criminal field, to which Dixon CJ referred, equally with the doctrine of res judicata, serves this requirement of flexibility for potential development of the law.""For those reasons, the Court in Unger did not exercise its discretion to extend time.Those principles have been applied in this Court, including in R v Gregory [2002] NSWCCA 199 at [38]-[45] and Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262; (2010) 205 A Crim R 138 at [19]-[24]. They were applied by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in R v Knight [1998] 1 NZLR 583 at 587 - 588 on which in turn the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal has consistently relied (the most recent decision is Chau Cheuk Yiu v Poon Kit Sang [2012] HKCFA 42; [2013] 1 HKC 478: see at [9]-[11] and [53]-[59]). All four of those decisions recognise that ""exceptional"" circumstances must be shown to warrant departing from the principle of finality. What will amount to the requisite exceptional circumstances cannot be defined exhaustively. However, in the present case, the application is more than three years out of time, and the majority of the sentence has been served. Most importantly, there is no explanation at all for the delay from 30 October 2009 until late 2011, save that the decision in Muldrock pointed to the possibility of an argument that the sentencing judge, who was bound by R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, had erred. That demonstrates the wholly adventitious background to the application which is now made. In my view this is a clear case for not departing from the principle stated in Unger. 
36These remarks are obiter, given that Hulme J and Button J expressly refrained from expressing a concluded view on that matter.  However, they suggest that an applicant seeking leave to appeal against sentence solely on the ground of Muldrock error, who requires an extension of time within which to file such an appeal, may encounter a significant hurdle.  Do the principles that influence the resolution of that issue play a part in the determination of a s 78 application which proceeds on exactly the same basis ?  If they don't, one is confronted with a somewhat unsatisfactory outcome : a referral of a sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 79 will allow for a reconsideration of sentence that might be denied to an applicant who has not previously exercised a right of appeal, but who is relevantly out of time.  
37There is yet another consideration : whilst this Court has the power, on an application for an extension of time within which to file an appeal, to consider the merits of the appeal, grant that extension and allow the appeal in order to correct a miscarriage of justice, notwithstanding the principle of finality, a judge performing the administrative act pursuant to ss 78 and 79 is bound by the terms of the legislation.  As McHugh J noted in Eastman, the provisions do not allow for the correction of every miscarriage of justice.
38I am of the view that the Attorney General's submissions concerning the interpretation of s 79 must be accepted, despite the evident disparity between those offenders who exercised their right of appeal against sentence pre-Muldrock and those who did not.  That disparity is the result of a change in the law, the consequences of which have been resolutely met by the application of the concept of merger.  There is nothing in the statutory scheme of Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act that evinces an intention to depart from that precept.
39The application is refused.

2706192,"FRIEND, Catherine Application under Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 1475","Judgment
1The applicant, Catherine Margaret Friend, was convicted by a jury of the murder of her de-facto husband Jason Friend (""the deceased""). The deceased died from a single gunshot to the back of his head whilst in bed at his home on 18 January 2002. 
2The Crown case against the applicant, as it was summarised by Sully J on appeal, was that she had been at the time of the killing, present in the premises within which the killing took place; and she had been there aiding and abetting the killer. An appeal against her conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed: Friend v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 41. Special Leave to Appeal to the High Court of Australia was refused: [2007] HCA Trans 489.
3By application dated 17 June 2011 the applicant seeks an inquiry into her conviction pursuant to ss75 and 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""the Act""). 
Legal principles
4Section 75, which empowers this Court to consider applications of this type, is in the following terms:
(1)  The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under this Part is to be exercised by the Chief Justice or by a Judge of the Supreme Court who is authorised by the Chief Justice to exercise that jurisdiction.
(2)  References in this Part to the Supreme Court are to be construed accordingly.
The procedure for making such applications is contained in section 78: (1)  An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.
(2)  The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.
That section is to be read in conjunction with section 79 which provides the following:
(1)  After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:(a)  the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or(b)  the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
(2)  Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.(3)  The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:
(a)  it appears that the matter:(i)  has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or(ii)  has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or(iii)  has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or(iv)  has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and(b)  the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.
(3A)  The Supreme Court may defer consideration of an application under section 78 if:(a)  the time within which an appeal may be made against the conviction or sentence (including an application for leave to appeal) is yet to expire, or(b)  the conviction or sentence is the subject of appeal proceedings (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) that are yet to be finally determined, or(c)  the application fails to disclose sufficient information to enable the conviction or sentence to be properly considered.
(4)  Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.
(5)  The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must report to the Minister as to any action taken by the Supreme Court under this section (including a refusal to consider or otherwise deal with an application).
5In Application of Peter James Holland under s. 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 Johnson J at [5] - [11] set out the principles governing these applications in the following terms:
[5] Part 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 has its origins in a legislative scheme which was an innovation in New South Wales - it is remedial legislation designed to overcome injustices that sometimes arise in the course of the administration of criminal justice: Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of NSW (2006) 66 NSWLR 151 at 154 [5], 155 [8]. An application under s 78 does not involve a judicial proceeding: s 79(4). In determining such an application, the Court performs an administrative act: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48-50; Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions [2003] 214 CLR 318 at 362 [124].
[6] The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s 79(2). With respect to repealed s 475 Crimes Act 1900 (which used similar words), it was said that this view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245. This formula has been applied since the repeal of s 475 and its replacement by the provisions now contained in s 79(2): Application of Pedrana (2000) 117 A Crim R 45 at 463 [28]; Application of Suey [2001] NSWSC 543 at [18].
[7] Where it is contended that a doubt or question exists concerning part of the evidence in the case, it is appropriate to consider whether any doubt or question about that part of the evidence produces a doubt or question as to guilt: Application of Moore (2000) 112 A Crim R 331 at 332 [6]. The section is to apply to a part of the evidence which has some real material substance as effecting the conclusion of guilt: Application of Suey at [19].
[8] There has to be available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet: Application of Esposito (Hunt J, 14 July 1988 unreported at p 2); Application of Visser (Newman J, 27 June 1994, BC9402667 at p 3); Application of Dunn [2005] NSWSC 857 at [9].
Some Other Features of the Jurisdiction
[9] The procedure under s 78 is not intended to provide a convicted person with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted: Application of Dunn at [9]; Application of Milat (2005) 157 A Crim R 565 at 574 [26]. Nor is it an opportunity, in a sense, to run the trial again on paper, with the ultimate submission that acquittal should result.
[10] The jurisdiction which a judge is exercising under Pt 7 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 is an administrative function which may be activated when the criminal justice system has run its course following trial and appeal and, in almost every case, where additional evidence has come to light which is said to raise a doubt or question as to guilt or sentence. The powers available under s 79 are limited to the direction of an inquiry or referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. They do not extend to a power to quash convictions or direct acquittals (as the Applicant sought in this case).
[11] The nature of the jurisdiction under Pt 7 involves some flexibility in the material which may be placed before a judge in support of an application for an order directing an inquiry or referring the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal. To invoke the fresh evidence rule at the ss 78-79 stage (as the Crown submissions of 30 November 2006 suggested by reference to R v Ion (1996) 89 A Crim R 81 at 93-94) does not sit well with the function being performed. In decisions concerning applications under s 475, it was observed that the fresh evidence rule had no application: Application of Esposito at p 2; Application of Visser at p 3.
Background
6In support of the application the applicant provided written submissions prepared by her counsel, Bret Walker SC, dated 17th June 2011, and received by the Court on 7 July 2011. The Crown in reply provided written submissions dated 13 September 2011. A further response to those submissions was filed on behalf of the applicant on 21 November 2011.
7The ground of the application is that further evidence has become available subsequent to the applicant's conviction - ""four groups of evidence that were available but not produced at the applicant's trial and one group of evidence that was not [then] available"" (application at [2]) - which should give rise to the requisite unease or sense of disquiet about the applicant's conviction in accordance with the test propounded in Varley v Attorney General (at [4] above).
Facts 
8These facts are derived from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The applicant shared a home with the deceased, her three children (then aged 1, 3 and 6 years), and two dogs. The couple had been in a relationship for approximately four years.   
9At approximately midnight on 18 January 2002, the deceased was, as I have said above, shot dead in his home. He was in the bed he normally shared with the applicant. The applicant says she was sleeping in the lounge room of the house with her youngest child nearby, while the other two children were asleep in another room in the house. 
10The applicant said that upon hearing the noise of the gunshot she awoke, believing it to be the sound of a motor car. The applicant said that she did not find the deceased's body until the following morning. 
11A neighbour Mr Dupon made a statement to the police on 18 January 2002. He said that he was lying in bed trying to get to sleep when he heard a loud bang and got up to investigate. Like most witnesses he did not identify the bang as a gunshot. He checked the back and front of his house. He said that about fifteen minutes later he noticed a light being switched on in the applicant's house, which he says was keeping him awake, and which stayed on for approximately 20 minutes. He was of the opinion that the noise was such that it would have woken up persons in the applicant's house.
12Mr Dupon gave a second statement, in which he said that the applicant came to his home the night after the shooting, at which time he asked the applicant about whether she had heard the sound of what was now known to be a shot the night before. He stated that the applicant responded by saying she had heard the noise, but when she had tried to check on the deceased she had been prevented from doing so by a barricade across the door to his bedroom. 
13Mr Dupon made a third statement on 18 March 2004. He said that after speaking with lawyers preparing the Crown case and reviewing his earlier statements he had realised a piece of information which he recalled, had not been included in his earlier statements. He says that shortly after completing the check of his property and car after hearing the loud noise, he went to his kitchen to get a drink of water and heard the sound of two voices, one male and one female, emanating from the courtyard of the applicant's house. He says he did not recognise the male voice but clearly recognised the female voice as that of the applicant. He says he recalls the female voice saying ""shut up"", which he presumed was directed towards the applicant's dogs, a not uncommon occurrence on his evidence.
14In his fourth and last statement to the police of 19 March 2004, Mr Dupon clarified that the voices he overheard sounded ""mumbled like they were talking quieter than you would normally speak"". He affirmed that the female voice belonged to the applicant and reiterated his belief that he had told the police this information at the time he gave his earlier statements. 
15It is not the Crown case that the applicant herself fired the lethal shot. The primary Crown case was that the applicant was in a joint enterprise with a co-accused (I will refer to this person as ""the co-accused""). The applicant commenced a relationship with the co-accused during a separation from the deceased about six months prior to his death. She had resumed cohabitation with the deceased and there was an issue at trial whether the relationship with the co-accused was then over. 
16The case against the co-accused was that he fired the lethal shot. As stated at the outset, the case against the applicant was that she had been, at the time of the killing, present in the premises within which the killing took place, assisting the co-accused. The co-accused was tried jointly with the applicant, but the jury could not agree upon a verdict in respect of him. He was tried for a second time but again the jury was unable to agree upon a verdict. 
17The alternative Crown case was that the applicant assisted the person who fired the shot, whether or not it was the co-accused.
18The case against the applicant was entirely circumstantial, relying on the following matters (Crown's Court of Criminal Appeal written submissions at [57], at [19] of CCA judgment):
(a)At the time of the murder the appellant and the deceased, although living together, were in a fractured relationship;(b)The extreme unlikelihood that an intruder would enter the house to murder the deceased knowing that it was likely that the appellant and her children were inside and would be a problem in one way or other. The house was a small one with relatively flimsy walls and had hard, tiled floors from the front door to the main bedroom door. There were also two dogs;(c)The difficulty of a gunman getting inside the house without the complicity of the appellant;(d)The appellant separating herself from the deceased on the night in question, through the manipulation of the child Georgia - sleeping in the lounge room;(e)Given the enormous noise the shotgun must have made her explanation relating it to a car outside was implausible. In any event, the shot came from the back of the house not out from the street;(f)The evidence of Mr. Dupon that he heard the appellant talking to a man in the courtyard. This indicated that what the appellant said about the events were false and that she was in league with the intruder;(g)How the morning unravelled. Her conversations with Mr. Dupon. The many inconsistencies in her statements to police, officials and other witnesses;(h)The appellant's description of what she did that morning did not adequately fill the 38 minutes from 6.30 a.m. (when the deceased was supposed to wake up) and 7.08 a.m. (when she eventually saw that he was dead and telephoned her mother);(i)Before making the triple 000 call at 7.08 a.m, there was first of all the false suggestion of a suicide;(j)Actions of the appellant, whilst to some degree explained by shock, when all added together presented a picture of someone setting about creating a false scenario and organising support for herself when police arrived: telephoning for the support of her mother and good friend before ringing 000;(k)She told Snr. Constable Turner that upon hearing the noise she turned on the outside light to investigate and yet Mr. Dupon did not see the light turned on;(l)Evidence from Mr. Dupon and his partner that the appellant told them she tried to get into the deceased's room at the time she heard the shot but his door was barricaded. She also told them the intruder had taken the deceased's keys and wallet although there was no evidence of that; (m)Evidence from Sgt. Hamshere and Dr. Pailthorpe that the flyscreen to the deceased's bedroom was cut from the inside. The Crown case was that the appellant did this to permit the intruder to come inside that way or to make it look as though he entered that way to hide the fact that the intruder entered by some other way that might implicate the appellant;(n)It was open to conclude that the appellant (sic) it was an unguarded moment when she told the real estate agent concerning the flyscreens, ""I noticed them two weeks ago""; and her explanation in evidence was unsatisfactory(o)Indications that she was not overly distressed by the deceased's death
19The Crown said all of these fifteen circumstances were established by the evidence and supported guilt beyond reasonable doubt as the only rational inference to be drawn.
20The applicant was convicted of murder and sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment.
Legal principles as to proof of guilt
21In cases which are wholly circumstantial it is customary to amplify the rule that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt by emphasising that ""guilt should not only be a rational inference but should be the only rational inference that can be drawn from the circumstances"": Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573 at 578 per Dawson J. It is also apt to bear in mind that in considering a circumstantial evidence case it is not the individual circumstances that need to be considered, but the combination and totality of the circumstances taken together. A jury can draw an inference of guilt from a combination of facts, none of which alone would support that inference: Chamberlain v The Queen (No. 2) (1984) 153 CLR 521 at 536. To express the same idea another way, ""a jury cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on circumstantial evidence unless no other explanation than guilt is reasonably compatible with the circumstances"": R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at [46].   
22It is a corollary of this rule, if there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open the accused is entitled to be acquitted as of right. But ""[i]t is of critical importance to recognise... that in considering a circumstantial case, all of the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence"": Hillier at [46]. Moreover, by reference to Chamberlain (No 2), Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ said at [48]:
Often enough, in a circumstantial case, there will be evidence of matters which, looked at in isolation from other evidence, would yield an inference compatible with innocence of the accused. But... a circumstantial case [is not] to be considered piecemeal. 
23  Finally, in Shepherd's case, Dawson J said at 579-580:
As I have said, the prosecution bears the burden of proving all the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt. That means that the essential ingredients of each element must be so proved. It does not mean that every fact - every piece of evidence - relied upon to prove an element by inference must itself be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Intent, for example, is, save for statutory exceptions, an element of every crime. It is something which, apart from admissions, must be proved by inference. But the jury may quite properly draw the necessary inference having regard to the whole of the evidence, whether or not each individual piece of evidence relied upon is proved beyond reasonable doubt, provided they reach their conclusion upon the criminal standard of proof. Indeed, the probative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider the degree of probability of each item of evidence separately.
The reasons of the Court of Criminal Appeal  
24The applicant appealed her conviction in the Court of Criminal Appeal on the following grounds:
(1)The jury's verdict was unreasonable and inconsistent with the evidence.(2)His Honour erred in admitting into evidence the previous consistent statements of the witness Dupon.(3)His Honour erred in not giving a 'Shepherd' direction (Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573) in relation to the evidence of Mr. Dupon, to the effect that the jury would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his evidence before the jury could return a verdict of guilty.(4)His Honour erred in not ordering that the appellant be tried separately from her co-accused.(5)His Honour erred in directing the jury that 'there may have been witnesses in this case, for all we know, who had a very adverse view about the accused'.
25As I have said, the appeal was dismissed. In the course of giving his reasons, Sully J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Hislop J agreed) gave an overview of the crime scene and of the Crown case from which the above summary is derived before going on to address each ground individually. 
26After closely reviewing the evidence and the arguments relating to each of the Crown's fifteen circumstances, Sully JA expressed the following conclusion at [105] - [106]:
[105] It now becomes necessary for this Court to step back, as it were, from the foregoing discussion of each of the individual items put forward by the Crown in support of its circumstantial case; and to consider whether it was reasonably open to the jury to find, upon the whole of that case, that the appellant was guilty of murder.
[106] In my opinion it was reasonably open to the jury to conclude that the considerations which I have discussed in connection with the items (b) (c) and (l), when viewed overall, pointed very strongly to the complicity of the appellant in the murder of the deceased. It was open to the jury, in my opinion, to reject the appellant's evidence flatly denying that she had had anything to do with the killing of the deceased. Once that position was reached, then it was, in my opinion, open to the jury to take the view that the evidence of motive, with all its weaknesses as I have previously herein discussed them, added at least something of weight to the incrementally strengthening circumstantial Crown case. It was, in my opinion, then reasonably open to the jury to take the view, by what I might describe as a process of incremental reasoning, that all of the evidence which they had heard about the fly-screens was either a red herring, as the Crown had contended in address; or was insufficient to establish that the killer, whoever he might have been, had been an intruder who had both entered and exited from the bedroom through the cut flap of the relevant fly-screen, and acting throughout independently of any advice or assistance given by the appellant.
The applicant's argument
27With respect, I accept that learned senior counsel for the applicant has accurately analysed the conclusions of Sully J in the following terms (applicant's submissions at p4 [10]-[11]):

10. The rationale behind the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision can effectively be reduced to three primary conclusions that effectively upheld the applicant's conviction and which the new evidence now destabilises. These are:
1. The extreme unlikelihood that an intruder would enter the house to murder the deceased knowing that it was likely that the appellant and her children were inside and would be a problem in one way or other. The house was a small one with relatively flimsy walls and had hard, tiled floors from the front door to the main bedroom door. There were also two dogs [item (b), para 19, CCA judgment];
2. The difficulty of a gunman getting inside the house without the complicity of the appellant [item (c), para 19, CCA judgment];
3. Evidence from Mr. Dupon and his partner that the appellant told them she tried to get into the deceased's room at the time she heard the shot but his door was barricaded. She also told them the intruder had taken the deceased's keys and wallet although there was no evidence of that [item (1), para 19, CCA judgment].
11. It is also possible that His Honour intended to include item (f) from CCA judgment amongst the above matters as the item relates to the evidence of Dupon together with item (1). Item (f) outlined the following matter:
(f) The evidence of Mr. Dupon that he heard the appellant talking to a man in the courtyard.
28However, it should not be overlooked that the jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing the applicant give evidence. It is not irrelevant to Sully J's conclusions that the jury must have rejected the applicant's evidence: Hillier at 639 [50]. The jury's verdict revealed that they were ""positively persuaded on a consideration of all of the evidence (including [hers])"" that she was not telling the truth when she denied any involvement in the murder.
The applicant's fresh evidence
The points concerning Mr Dupon's evidence
29The applicant's first two points concern Mr Dupon's evidence and it is convenient to deal with them together. I accept the argument that the acceptance by the jury of Mr Dupon's evidence about hearing the whispered conversation in the courtyard in the aftermath of the shot must have been critical to their determination that the applicant was guilty. It is clearly a critical aspect of the Crown case theory that two people, a male and female, were present near the scene of the crime in its immediate aftermath; after all, no case was ever made against the applicant that she pulled the trigger. 
30Two points are made on behalf of the applicant about this. First, there is now an availability for expert evidence to be led to demonstrate that Mr Dupon's evidence was not credible in the sense of being an unreliable reconstruction. Secondly, expert and lay evidence has been obtained to demonstrate that the applicant's debarked poodle, Brodie, emits a low husky or raspy noise like a guttural whisper. 
31Section 108C creates an exception to the exclusionary credibility rule established by s102 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). It is in the following terms:
(1)  The credibility rule does not apply to evidence given by a person concerning the credibility of another witness if: 
(a)  the person has specialised knowledge based on the person's training, study or experience, and(b)  the evidence is evidence of an opinion of the person that: (i)  is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge, and(ii)  could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the witness, and(c)  the court gives leave to adduce the evidence.
(2)  To avoid doubt, and without limiting subsection (1): 
(a)  a reference in that subsection to specialised knowledge includes a reference to specialised knowledge of child development and child behaviour (including specialised knowledge of the impact of sexual abuse on children and their behaviour during and following the abuse), and(b)  a reference in that subsection to an opinion of a person includes, if the person has specialised knowledge of that kind, a reference to an opinion relating to either or both of the following: (i)  the development and behaviour of children generally,(ii)  the development and behaviour of children who have been victims of sexual offences, or offences similar to sexual offences.
32The text of the provision does not provide much guidance as to its meaning and operation. Clearly, paragraph (a) engages the provisions of s79 of the Act. From this it is plain that it is providing for the admission of expert evidence - properly so called - only, within the usual constraints which attend the admission of evidence in that category: Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 243 CLR 588. 
33Bearing these constraints in mind, it may be said that the enactment of the provision was a response to judicial observations like those, albeit in a civil case, of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; 214 CLR 118 at 129 [31]:
Further, in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. Considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events. This does not eliminate the established principles about witness credibility; but it tends to reduce the occasions where those principles are seen as critical [footnote omitted].
34The significance of the requirement for leave should not be overlooked. Clearly leave would not be granted unless the court is satisfied the experts opinion could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of the particular witness concerned. In this regard, it may be necessary to show that the relevant field of specialised knowledge adds value to what ordinary adults would understand about the fallibility of human memory and the means by which its reliability may ordinarily be tested. 
35The Victorian Court of Appeal in MA v R [2013] VSCA 20 considered s108C of the Victorian Uniform Evidence Law, which is materially similar to the NSW provision. In the course of finding that general opinion evidence concerning how a child may react to sexual abuse was admissible, Redlich and Whelan JJA at [100] expressed the view that:
The occasion should be relatively rare where an expert should be invited to express an opinion as to the actual behaviour of the victim... and whether it advanced the probabilities of a fact in issue. Where a party seeks to have an expert go so far, the obligation of the trial judge under s 137 of the Evidence Act to exclude evidence if its probative value was outweighed by its prejudice may assume greater significance.
36I acknowledge the obvious; in some circumstances the expert evidence may be admissible to bolster a witness's credibility. But that is not relevant here.      
37Given the administrative nature of the task that I am required to undertake I think it appropriate for me to put the question of leave to one side, as it is clear from his qualifications and curriculum vitae that Dr Ian Coyle is an expert psychologist qualified to speak about the workings of the mind including memory. Having said this, it must be borne in mind that the primary function of the expert is to impart so much of his or her branch of specialised knowledge as will equip the tribunal of fact with relevant tools necessary to decide the case: Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305. However to the extent to which Dr Coyle has expressed matters within the ken of ordinary folk, reflecting upon issues like delayed reporting or prior inconsistencies, I would regard his evidence as not wholly or substantially based upon his specialised knowledge: s79(1) Evidence Act; Clark v Ryan (1960) 103 CLR 486. Ordinary members of the community well understand the significance of such matters. 
38Leaving aside what Dr Coyle says about ""lack of realism"", which seems to refer to considerations of overall consistency with other accounts, prior inconsistent statements and the evidence of others who denied receiving an early report from Mr Dupon, all of which I would regard as not dependent upon specialised knowledge, the gravamen of his opinion relates to the effects of attention and expectancy upon perception. Dr Coyle effectively says that Mr Dupon ""simply wasn't paying attention"". And in any event if the sound of a voice speaking emanated from his neighbour's place the natural tendency is to expect the person speaking is his neighbour. These factors, coupled with what he regards as inconsistency with other evidence, according to the expert, are consistent with reconstruction (Dr Coyle says re-creation) ""of his memory of the night in question"". Dr Coyle says this calls into question, in a very significant way, Mr Dupon's reliability as a witness.
39I do not regard the availability of Dr Coyle's evidence as making any difference in the present case. First, the non-expert issues of late reporting, prior inconsistency, lack of consistency with other relevant evidence, lack of attention and mistake were all explored appropriately with the utmost thoroughness by learned trial counsel. Counsel also relied upon these matters in seeking to persuade the jury that they should not accept Mr Dupon's evidence. Secondly, so far as expectancy effect is concerned, this was dealt with most effectively, with respect, in the summing up of trial judge, Adams J.    
40The Court of Criminal Appeal had regard to these matters, and I will set out paragraphs [121] - [123] of Sully J's judgment dealing with counsel's argument:
[121]...[Counsel's] submissions respecting Mr. Dupon's evidence occupy the whole or part of some 14 pages of transcript: T 1889-1902. The flavour of the submissions, read fairly as a whole, emerges in their very opening paragraphs:
""Before I discuss the evidence of Mr. Dupon it's clear in the Crown case that his credibility - I won't say this - his account is a very important aspect of the Crown case. It's important from Catherine Friend's perspective to scrutinise his account of the voices in the courtyard with care. Not only is it an important part of the Crown case, but the evidence of Mr. Dupon that he told the police from the very start about the voices in the courtyard has to be evaluated by reference to what others say in the call, the people he says he spoke to about this, other police officers.
By looking at the internal consistency of what he records in his witness statement about these issues, the unfolding nature of his witness statements is also another telling aspect which in my submission you could take into account in evaluating this evidence. His knowledge of what is omitted from the witness statement and his reaction in that regard, his contemporaneous account of what he heard and the accuracy of those statements and other issues associated with his account.
Now one can take into account, in evaluating the reliability of his observations about the sounds and the voices in the courtyard, the delay in disclosing the written form, going to the authorities and saying there were voices in the courtyard, and you can take into account my cross-examination of Mr. Dupon in determining his reliability in this regard................... "" [T 1889,1890]
[122] Counsel's submissions continued with a careful and detailed canvass of aspects of Mr. Dupon's evidence at trial and of aspects of the contents of the various pre-trial statements that Mr. Dupon had made to the investigating police. Towards the end of this portion of his closing address, counsel put these propositions:

""......... Ultimately, I would be submitting to you when you come to evaluate Mr. Dupon's evidence, you will have the benefit of his Honour's directions of law regarding that evidence. Catherine Friend does not say that Mr. Dupon is necessarily wrong about his recollections, however, we don't concede it is right what he says. He may quite genuinely be mistaken about everything associated with this. Of course, he made no concession that he was mistaken. I have read to you when I put to him ""you may be mistaken"".
But by that stage, the stage of this trial, he has furnished the last witness' statement, the one I have just taken you to, the one of March 2004, where he records voices in the courtyard for the first time. Of course, he says to you, the Jury, he told all and sundry, in terms of police officers, three of them - well no, two of them, not Sergeant Hohnen - those police officers, that salient fact.
I will take you through the rest of the evidence in that regard. But I will be submitting to you this: that in the course of human affairs, common sense will dictate that an individual who has finally prepared a witness' statement about voices in the court-yard two years after the event may be extremely reluctant to admit any form of concession they are mistaken. It is very significant evidence in this trial against Catherine Friend. Let us not make any distinction in that regard. There would be, in my submission, a natural reluctance to admit any sort of mistake."" [T 1900, 1901]
[123] Counsel rounded out his submissions concerning the evidence of Mr. Dupon by putting to the jury the following submissions:
""So what we have is Mr. Dupon's evidence that he told police officers about this very important piece of information. Junee can't recall it and Sparkes says it wasn't volunteered or disclosed to him. And the first police officer to actually ask Mr. Dupon about his evidence, it is not disclosed, at least in terms of the note.
Common sense would dictate to you, even if you were investigating a murder such as this, that hearing voices in the court-yard after a discharge of a firearm is very significant and important and if told to you, you would remember it. In considering Mr. Dupon's evidence as a whole, I would ask you to consider he is mistaken about this, certainly about the identification of the sex of the individual, a male individual, mumbling in the court-yard. It can be TV in the middle of the night. It is a quiet night, apparently. He can hear the TV. Could be the dogs. Could be my client. You have heard my client's explanation, she was subject to cross-examination on the issue."" [T 1902]
41Having reviewed the material, I am driven to comment that Adams J dealt with Mr Dupon's evidence with impeccable fairness and great clarity. Again, I will extract the relevant parts from Sully J's judgment:
[124] It is useful to complete the present survey of the relevant course of events at the trial, by noting the way in which his Honour dealt with Mr. Dupon's evidence in the summing-up. Early in the summing-up his Honour gave the jury the following general directions and observations:
""So then, this was no more than a recollection of something that took only a few fleeting seconds, to which he was not paying any particular notice and when he was going off to bed to resume the sleep that had been so rudely interrupted by the loud bang.
I make the common sense observation, members of the Jury, but of course it is a matter for you, that it is actually quite difficult when you are relying on hearing alone and even when you are paying attention, to place where any noise is coming from. When you are not really paying any attention to it, you have no reason to assess the reliability or question the accuracy of your immediate impression. In this respect, the impression that the voices were, as it were, following him along the corridor might be significant. It is a matter for you, because it might suggest some other source than the court-yard for them, since voices might well have been carried by the peculiarities of high paling fences and surrounding building. When that happens, when the sound is being bounced around, it might well seem to follow you, you may think. This is just part of ordinary, human experience.
Moreover, the power of assumption is very significant. If, during the few seconds in question, Mr. Dupon assumed that he was hearing voices from the court-yard, perhaps that was indeed where Catherine Friend's voice came from. It might be very difficult for him later to separate the assumption from the actual experience. Of course, once the idea is planted, probably unconsciously, it becomes by and large, does it not, the reality. It cannot be effectively re-examined or revisited. In other words, if you didn't pay attention at the time, later thinking about it doesn't help. You are still thinking about something that you didn't pay much attention to at the time.
So that in this case, upon this consideration, the evidence of Mr. Dupon that he heard the voices coming from the court-yard is truly his honest evidence. It is this difficult area between the experience and the opinion or belief that a witness has about it, that you need to explore in asking yourself whether it is safe to rely on Mr. Dupon's evidence, not that he heard voices but where those voices were coming from.
Now, the evaluation of these matters, it is a matter for you and I expect that I am merely bringing to your attention questions that you have already thought about and no doubt discussed. However, I feel that I would be very remiss in my duty if I did not impress upon you the need to be very cautious indeed about regarding the evidence of Mr. Dupon about hearing a conversation between the accused Catherine Friend and a male in the court-yard at 28 Wyattville Drive as being reliable enough to act upon. If, on the other hand, after thinking about the matter carefully and exercising the necessary caution that you must, given the whole of the circumstances and the importance of that question, you are persuaded that indeed he did hear that evidence, well that would be a very important factor which you would bring to bear in your consideration of the issues in this case, in particular the case of Catherine Friend."" [SU 18, 19, 20 and 21]
[125] Towards the end of the summing-up, and having made a carefully detailed canvass of Mr. Dupon's evidence at trial, his Honour said:
""Now, the parties rely in different ways on the way in which Mr. Dupon brought this conversation to the attention of police. I think the only matter that I want to refer you to specifically, because you have got all his statements, is the point that there was a door knock. The police had gone around asking people what they had seen and heard. Constable Hohnen was one of those police. I do not think his notebook is before you because it was extracted in oral evidence.
The important point, you might think, about his evidence is this. He is asking whether anything was, in particular, seen and heard, and Mr. Dupon talked about hearing the bang and does not talk about hearing the voices. Now, it may be that he simply overlooked it. It did not occur to him that it was important. There are a number of possible explanations. Nevertheless, it does seem that the first time he is asked about what he heard that might be important, he does not advert to the voices at all. That point is perhaps less significant than it might otherwise appear, though it's a matter for you, in that he doesn't mention that he heard Catherine Friend's voice and it's not disputed that indeed she did say something in the patio. The strange thing you might think, ladies and gentlemen, about this aspect of the evidence is this, especially when it comes to Mr. Dupon's statement to the police, and that is he assumed; he told you that conversation was between, he had heard a conversation between Jason and Catherine, but he learnt very early in the morning that Jason was shot and that that was the bang that he heard or almost certainly the bang that he heard, yet he did not, it seems, realise that it followed that the voice that he heard could not be that of Jason Friend. He simply never made the link."" [SU 81, 82, 83] 42In my opinion, with respect to him, Dr Coyle's expression of similar ideas adds no value to the thorough and careful way in which the important question of the reliability of Mr Dupon's account was put to and left with the jury by trial counsel and the trial judge. I think it fair to say, all of the essential issues discussed by Dr Coyle were thoroughly and appropriately canvassed in the passages I have quoted above.
43Thirdly, I mean no disrespect to Dr Coyle when I point out that his report does not adequately identify the rules developed by his branch of specialised knowledge for assessing the matters he addresses in a way which would assist a jury to assess the credibility, in the sense of reliability, of Mr Dupon's evidence. His opinion falls into the category of the bare ipse dixit.
44Fourthly, there was simply no issue at the trial that the applicant was in the courtyard in the immediate aftermath of what proved to be the gunshot. There was no issue that she audibly uttered the words ""shut up"". She said so in her own evidence in chief: 1704.45T; 1705.20 - 30T; 1707.55 - 1708.15T, 24th June 2005. 
45This brings me to the second point concerning Mr Dupon's evidence; that is that he may have been mistaken in that the ""male voice"" he heard was in fact the rasping of the debarked poodle, Brodie. This is the inference that the fresh evidence of the veterinary surgeon, Dr Adams, and the lay witness, Ms Jane Miles, is said to support. 
46Once again however, that hypothesis consistent with innocence was fully explored at the trial (1707-1708T):
Q.  What's your recollection about the sequence of events about the dogs, and saying ""shut up"" to the dogs that night?A.  I just remember when, when I woke up to the loud noise, I put Georgia back down in the bed and then I went out the front, and as I come back inside the house the dogs were going berserk and they were running around the house and towards the back-door, and they were scratching at the back-door but they didn't want to go out, so.
Q.  You went outside into the courtyard?A.  I let - I let the dogs out.  They went out, and then Priscilla was barking - the other dog wasn't able to bark because she was debarked - but they both went out and she was barking.
Q.  Would you have said anything else, except ""shut up""?     A.  Possibly I would have.
Q.  Possibly what?A.  Gotten angry at her to tell her to calm down, come back inside.
Q.  How would you have said that, if you had said it? A.  I don't know.  I was half asleep. But I wouldn't have been too happy, because I wasn't very happy anyway because I hadn't been to sleep for a few days.
Q.  What was the status of the TV at this time? A.  The TV was on.
Q.  How do you know it was on?   A.  The TV is always on in my house. It is the first thing I do in the morning, and I go to sleep with it on every night.
Q.  Where was Georgia at this time?   A.  I had left her on the mattress.  She had woken up, but when I put her back down she had gone back to sleep.
Q.  In paragraph 30 I think you indicate in fact that you had turned the TV off?A.  No.  I turned the - I turned the TV on when Jason was going to bed and I was going to go to bed, and he had put her in her cot and he came back and said to me, I think it was something along the lines of, that it was a short sleep, a cat nap. I got her out of the cot, and that is when I was going to sleep in the lounge room and I turned the TV on.
Q.  So do you know why it is ""off"" rather than ""on""? A.  No, I don't, but I know I turned it on because I got the remote control off the entertainment unit and it was beside the bed.
Q.  You say, just before the reference to the TV, you ""locked the back door"".  What was the status of the doors in the house in relation to your dogs?A.  Normally the back screen door, security mesh screen door and the back glass sliding door off the family room
Q.  Off the kitchen?A.  Kitchen, yes.  I generally, as a rule, used to keep them open enough for Priscilla and Brodie to go in and out to the toilet.

47The applicant adhered to this account in cross-examination: 1762.25 - 1763.10T. She said she was in the paved area of the courtyard just outside the sliding family room door. She said Brodie ""was not making any noise because... she couldn't bark"". However jurors are likely to know, from their own experience of life, that debarked dogs emit a raspy whispering sound. Her account is that the poodle Priscilla was barking (1762.20 - 45T). The applicant's evidence was that she yelled out ""shut up"". This may raise a question about how Mr Dupon would have heard the raspy bark over the full bark, which I need not tarry to consider. 
48Mr Dupon gave evidence of a male and female voice talking and that one of those voices talking was the applicant's, because he heard her say shut up ""as she normally says to her dogs"": 589.25 - 55T. He said the voices were speaking in a normal conversational tone and that he did not take any notice. The voices were coming from the courtyard next door. But in chief he said he didn't hear any dogs at the time (591.5-30T).    
49In cross-examination for the applicant, he said the voices were not whispering and that he really ""didn't take any notice of what they were saying"". The only clear words he heard were ""shut up"": 654.5-10T. He assumed they were his neighbours, Jason and Catherine Friend: 655.40T. At 656.5T he said:
The assumption, the reason I have taken there were two people in the courtyard, was because I heard the sounds of a male and a female voice, yes.
  He denied he was mistaken about hearing a male voice (691.20T). 
50At the earlier trial before Hidden J, when asked about barking dogs, he gave the following evidence (at 758.40-55T):
Q: This issue of what you heard at that time, it could have been barking dogs?A: Well I didn't hear any dogs but it could have. I didn't hear any dogs that night. 
Q: One of the dogs is debarked to your knowledge?A: No I didn't realise that, no... 
Q: You heard the feet of the dogs, did you not?A: Well I can't recall 100 per cent. I thought I heard the feet of the dogs. 
This line of cross-examination does not seem to have been pursued at the third trial, but the issue that Mr Dupon mistook the sound of the dogs including the debarked poodle for a male voice was fully rehearsed and put to the jury. 
51Moreover, as I have indicated above, Adams J effectively gave the jury a Shepherd direction in relation to Mr Dupon's evidence about the conversation, that is, that his evidence was an essential link in the circumstantial chain and that the jury could not convict unless satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt. The Court of Criminal Appeal was satisfied that from what his Honour said, the jury would have understood that Mr Dupon's evidence about the conversation was an indispensable intermediate fact: [141] - [142] per Sully J.   
An alternate entry point
52As has been pointed out already, one of the circumstances established by the evidence was the difficulty of the gunman gaining access without the complicity of the applicant. At an earlier trial a police officer had given evidence that a side door to the garage accessible to the street was open and that its lock and bolt were undamaged. A back door to the garage was closed but unlocked. By this means an intruder could gain unforced access to the courtyard at the side of the house. As the applicant gave unchallenged evidence that the side sliding door to the family room was normally kept open to permit the dogs to come and go, as they needed, the police officers evidence combined with hers supported the case that her complicity was unnecessary for entry by an intruder. 
53Two things may be said about this point. At 1709.5T, the applicant herself gave the evidence that the garage door was propped open to allow the cat to come and go. She was unsure whether the garage door leading onto the courtyard was ""open or closed or whatever"" (1709.50). But this evidence establishes the existence of the garage doors door and raises the distinct possibility that both were kept unlocked. 
54She gave the evidence as set out above that the side sliding door to the family room was normally unlocked: 1708.50-55T. Some of her evidence suggests that the side sliding door may have been closed, if not actually locked. Particularly her evidence of the dogs scratching at the backdoor and ""I let the dogs out"": 1708.5T. However in cross-examination at 1762.15 she said that after she had come back from the front of the house after putting the garbage bin out, she went outside to tell the dogs ""to be quiet and to stop them running in and out the door"". Although the evidence-in-chief and cross-examination may not be entirely consistent, on the whole it may be said that there was circumstantial evidence at least that the sliding door was left open.
55The second thing relates to the cut in the flyscreen covering the pane of the northern window in the main bedroom, which is the subject of the applicant's fourth point. It is convenient to deal with them both here. As Sully J pointed out in the Court of Criminal Appeal, although there were some aspects of the applicant's evidence about this topic which were difficult to reconcile, generally the existing evidence favoured the defence: [94] - [99]. Sully J identified a lacuna in the Crown case and the defence expert, professor Abel, was not effectively challenged about his hypothesis. Accordingly the evidence about the flyscreen did not establish a circumstance consistent with guilt. Indeed that evidence, on its own, demonstrated that it was possible for an armed person to have cut his way through the fly screen, opened the window, and entered the bedroom to shoot the deceased without any assistance from the applicant. Understanding why a person would do that is a little more difficult, as the flyscreen could have been easily removed. But these matters together show that the applicant was not deprived of any opportunity by the absence of evidence from senior constable Davies at the final trial. 
56The real point of the Crown case, which the jury would have considered, was that gaining access to a small house, without the applicant's complicity, would have been difficult without detection given the number of occupants, including the applicant and two small dogs. 
Video re-enactment evidence
57I have pointed out that the evidence generally supported the possibility of a grown man entering the bedroom of the deceased through the cut in the flyscreen of the bedroom window. Video evidence had been led at the first trial before Hidden J, depicting a police officer of about 183cm in height climbing in and out of the window with a long arm shotgun, through the cut in the flyscreen. There is no doubt that trial counsel for the applicant knew of the evidence, but as the Crown argue, no legal representative for any party showed any interest in having the video tendered. 
58A police officer of 185cm weighing 114kg gave evidence that he would have needed a larger cut because he was a bit overweight. This evidence really proved nothing.
59The Crown's obligation of fairness is important, but it does not extend beyond a duty to assist in securing a fair trial. It does not extend to an obligation to present the defence case: Mallard v R (2005) 224 CLR 125 at [73] - [74] and [82].
60Trial counsel for the applicant argued that an unknown intruder could have entered and left through the flyscreen: 1904.5-45T. The Crown did not argue that it was impossible. 
The availability of the evidence of the co-accused
61As has been pointed out, the jury which convicted the applicant could not agree about the guilt or innocence of the alleged co-accused, and nor could a subsequent jury. That person exercised his right not to give evidence at the joint trial, but gave evidence at the subsequent trial. His subsequent trial included evidence which, if accepted, neutralised the prospect of an ongoing relationship between him and the applicant as a motive to the extent their break-up had been initiated by the applicant, and she had told him she was happy with her resumed cohabitation with the deceased. An innocent explanation was proffered for the telephone call between the applicant and the co-accused on 15th January 2002, which lasted for 29 minutes. The explanation was consistent with the applicant's evidence. The Crown said the long telephone call three days before the murder must have had a sinister connotation. 
62As the Crown and the applicant accept, the evidence given by the co-accused is largely consistent with the ERISP of 21st January 2002 that was played for the jury which convicted the applicant. That material was available to the applicant as her submissions acknowledge. It was admissible under s83 Evidence Act if the applicant consented and under s65 as a previous representation of the co-accused given that he was not available to give evidence by virtue of s17 of that Act. He was not competent to give evidence for the prosecution and he was not compellable to give evidence for the applicant at a joint trial (see Part 2, Clause 4 of the dictionary to the Act). 
63I well understand that the applicant may feel a great sense of disappointment that she was convicted and her co-accused was not. But it is not completely accurate to say, as is argued in the submissions on her behalf, that two juries could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the co-accused was the murderer. Rather, two juries were unable to agree whether he was or not. Even his acquittal would not of itself been suggestive of something unsatisfactory about the applicant's conviction.  
64If the applicant had the benefit of another trial, the co-accused would be compellable (see s17(3) Evidence Act), but as he has not been convicted it would be open to him to decline to answer questions under s128 Evidence Act. Obviously the applicant would not seek to incriminate the co-accused. It is equally obvious that a cross-examiner might. His evidence might be of doubtful quality in those circumstances.
65I accept the Crown submission that ""the impact of having oral evidence from [the co-accused] would not have advanced the juries insight into their relationship beyond the material they already had available"". 
Conclusion                  
66I accept the full force of the applicant's submission that it is not apt to consider each of the five points made ""piecemeal"". The question must be whether taking this ""new"" evidence together with all the circumstances established by the evidence led at the trial, I am left uneasy, or with a sense of disquiet about the applicant's conviction because all of the circumstances together with the ""new"" material may leave open a reasonable inference consistent with innocence for a jury. 
67Equally, it would be wrong to focus upon the five matters relied upon by the applicant separately. For that would be to invite the consideration of those matters in isolation from the other circumstances to seek an inference compatible with innocence. 
68In every case there will be evidence consistent with innocence. I reiterate, the question is whether there is an inference consistent with innocence when all of the circumstances established by the evidence are considered and weighed together. 69In my opinion, the new material as a matter of practical reality does not add to the circumstances proved by the evidence at the trial in any meaningful way, and for the reasons I have expressed while considering the applicant's argument, it does not appear to me that there is a doubt or question as to the applicant's guilt. 
70I have earnestly considered all the submissions made by Mr Walker SC and those made by the Crown. I have concluded that the issues addressed by the new evidence raised were fully dealt with in the course of the trial at which the applicant was convicted. There has been an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which conducted a real review and consideration of the evidence led, and arguments advanced, at the trial. That court held the conviction was open. In all the circumstances, the consideration of the new evidence and the submissions in relation to it, together with the other material, has not given rise to any feeling in me of disquiet or unease about the conviction.
71I would refuse the application under s78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).

2706208,R v Wilson (No. 2) [2013] NSWSC 1288,"Judgment (On FITNESS TO BE TRIED - T20)

1JOHNSON J: On 19 August 2013, I embarked upon an inquiry into the fitness of Joseph Rowan Wilson to be tried on charges of murder, solicit to murder and commit act intending to cause a person to give false evidence. The inquiry was adjourned in circumstances described in my judgment, R v Wilson (No 1) [2013] NSWSC 1146. The earlier judgment ought be read in conjunction with the present reasons. 

2Since the inquiry commenced on 19 August 2013, Professor David Greenberg has again examined Mr Wilson. A report of Professor Greenberg of 5 September 2013 is in evidence before me. Professor Greenberg has examined Mr Wilson on a number of earlier occasions, and his most recent report helpfully outlines the history with respect to Mr Wilson since he was first charged with the present matters in November 2009. 

3There is, within Professor Greenberg's report of 5 September 2013, a section containing a detailed opinion concerning the current fitness of Mr Wilson to be tried (Exhibit C, pages 6-7): 

""FITNESS TO PLEAD AND STAND TRIAL

I assessed Mr Wilson with regard to Presser (1958) VR 45 at 48 and Kesavarajah vs R (1994) 123 ALR 463 criteria.

Mr Wilson understands the nature of charges he is currently facing. 

He understands the various pleas that are available to him. He understands the difference between a guilty and a not guilty plea and in rudimentary terms the possible consequences or outcomes of these pleas. 

He understands the nature of an oath and the consequences of perjury. 

He generally understands the nature of the proceedings, that it is an enquiry into the veracity of allegations against him. 

He generally cognitively understands the course of proceedings and the functions of officers in Court. However, when asked about his Barrister, he claimed that his Barrister had been sacked because he was part of the 'commie murders'. He understood the role of the various other stake holders in Court, including the Judge, witnesses and the prosecutor. He understood that he was the accused. 

He understood the nature of a jury; how many members of a jury, how they were selected and his right to challenge the jurors. 

I am of the opinion that Mr Wilson would have difficulty appreciating the substantial effect of evidence given in Court given his acute paranoid psychotic symptoms including bizarre somatic and paranoid delusional beliefs. Also at times his thoughts were disjointed and his various delusional beliefs appear to be intertwined with his understanding of his cognitive reality. He claimed that his solicitor, Jennifer Powell, and he went to TAFE together; they had done a course in dairy farming. He then stated that if someone wanted to clean up your house and if you had never seen them before, would you let them in? He ruminated about having money under the mattress and Blue Tac on the lock. He explained his distress about the legal system. When questioned about whether he would receive a fair trial, he stated that he had reservations about the impartiality of the Judge. He stated that he would demand 'blood tests and photos' of all the jury members before he would be comfortable that they were going to give him a fair trial. Mr Wilson also questioned the role of his solicitor. He stated that it would not matter even if he selected his own lawyer because if the jury was not up to scratch it doesn't matter. Mr Wilson's paranoid belief system appeared to be impinging on his acceptance that he could receive a fair trial. He appears to believe he cannot be represented by his legal representation and the impartiality of the Judge and/or jury is in question.

At this time I would have concerns about his ability to instruct his legal counsel about what defence he should make. 

I am of the view that he could probably give his version of the facts but may have difficulty giving evidence given that his thoughts are somewhat disjointed and he continues to voice bizarre paranoid delusions.

I am therefore of the opinion, that on balance, Mr Wilson is currently not fit to plead and is unfit to stand trial at this time.""

4Professor Greenberg has concluded that Mr Wilson is presently not fit to plead and to stand trial. I note that Dr Nielssen, in his most recent report of 1 August 2013, had expressed the same opinion. Accordingly, the psychiatric evidence before the Court is unanimous in the view as to Mr Wilson's current unfitness. 

5The earlier judgment which I delivered, and the various psychiatric reports, have pointed to fluctuations in Mr Wilson's condition, depending upon treatment being provided from time to time. 

6I note that Mr Wilson is in Court, and is sitting quietly and attentively as this hearing has proceeded and as I am delivering these reasons. I hope that he will remain in a position to follow, to the extent that the evidence indicates, not only what is happening today, but what will happen on the next occasion. 

7Given the position of Mr Wilson, as a person who had been found unfit to be tried and referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal, and with that Tribunal having determined that he would become fit to be tried, the provisions contained in ss.29 and 30 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""MH(FP) Act"") came into play. I mentioned this in R v Wilson (No. 1) at [20]-[24]. 

8The Tribunal having expressed that view in March 2013, the matter has come back to the Court. The Director of Public Prosecutions has indicated that the criminal proceedings are to continue against Mr Wilson, and thus it is the obligation of the Court to hold a further inquiry as to his fitness, in accordance with s.29(1)(b) MH(FP) Act. As s.29(4) MH(FP) Act makes clear, ss.11 and 12 of the Act apply to the present inquiry, in the same way as they applied to earlier inquiries undertaken concerning Mr Wilson. 

9Thus, the present inquiry is to proceed before a Judge sitting alone and it is necessary for the Court to set out the principles of law and the findings of fact on which the Court relies: s.11.

10Unless the Court otherwise allows, the inquiry is to proceed with Mr Wilson represented by an Australian legal practitioner, and Mr Ainsworth and Ms Wright appear for him today and have assisted the Court. The inquiry is not to be conducted in an adversary manner and the onus of proof does not rest upon any party: s.12. 

11The principles of law applicable on the inquiry such as this are clear. The sole question is whether the Court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Mr Wilson is unfit to be tried for the offences alleged against him: s.6.

12The issue falls to be determined by application of what is described as the Presser test - that test emerging from the decision of Smith J in R v Presser (1958) VR 45 at 48. The Presser test has been described in decisions of the High Court of Australia, including Kesavarajah v R [1994] HCA 41; 181 CLR 230 at 245-246. 

13It is those principles which I have applied at this inquiry and I note that Professor Greenberg referred to the decisions in Presser and Kesavarajah in expressing the opinion which he did. These principles are well known to forensic psychiatrists and those involved in the criminal law. 

14It is necessary for the Court to express findings of fact. It is sufficient to refer to the findings expressed in R v Wilson (No. 1) and, in addition, to express my acceptance of the opinions of both Professor Greenberg in his most recent report and of Dr Nielssen in his report of 1 August 2013. 

15The evidence points clearly, in my view, to the fact that Mr Wilson is presently unfit to be tried. 

16The consequence of that finding is that the Court must then consider which part of s.30(2) MH(FP) Act comes into play. 

17Section 30(2)(a) MH(FP) Act applies where a person who is found by the Court to be unfit to be tried has been detained, either as an ""inmate"" or as a ""forensic patient"", for a period or continuous periods in the aggregate of not less than 12 months and there has been no special hearing.

18I note that the definition of ""inmate"" in ss.3 and 4 Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 includes persons who are in custody on remand (see s.4(1)(d)). The definition of ""forensic patient"" in s.42 MH(FP) Act includes a person who is detained following a finding of unfitness to be tried under s.14 of that Act. Mr Wilson has been so found at least once in the period since November 2009. 

19It is the case that Mr Wilson has been detained in custody, either as a remand prisoner or as a forensic patient, for a period well in excess of 12 months and probably for the entire period since he was charged with these matters on 25 November 2009.

20No special hearing has been held with respect to Mr Wilson on these charges. 

21Mr Wilson's case falls squarely within the terms of s.30(2)(a) of the Act. 

22The statutory scheme leads to the conclusion that the Court must conduct a special hearing. The rationale for this seems clear. Where a person in Mr Wilson's position has been found unfit to be tried and has proceeded to the Tribunal, with the Tribunal concluding that he is likely to become fit to be tried in a period of 12 months, the matter returns to the Court. If the Court finds that he is again unfit to be tried and if he has been detained for more than 12 months, the statute mandates that the time has come for a special hearing to take place. That is the point which has now been reached with respect to Mr Wilson. 

23I observe that a listing has been made, subject to any finding today, for proceedings against Mr Wilson to be heard at the Supreme Court sitting at Nowra commencing on 4 November 2013. The effect of the orders which I will make today will be that the Court will proceed with a special hearing commencing on that date. 

24I observe that s.21(2) MH(FP) Act requires that, at a special hearing, the accused person must, unless the Court otherwise allows, be represented by an Australian legal practitioner, and the fact that the person has been found unfit to be tried for an offence is to be presumed not to be an impediment to the person's representation. This provision emphasises the importance of a person in Mr Wilson's position being represented at a special hearing, not only to protect his interests but also to assist the Court in the determination of the important matters which will arise at the special hearing. It is hoped that Mr Ainsworth will be in a position to continue to represent Mr Wilson and to assist him at that important hearing which is some two months away. 

25I note that there are some matters contained in Professor Greenberg's report of 5 September 2013 concerning treatment of Mr Wilson, together with discussion as to where he may be placed in the custodial system.

26On the last occasion, I made a recommendation concerning the placement of Mr Wilson. That recommendation was based upon the Court's concern that, despite what the Mental Health Review Tribunal had determined, he was being held in what seemed to be a mainstream facility at Goulburn and that this had proved somewhat problematic with respect to his treatment.

27I will not make any formal recommendation today as to any place where Mr Wilson is to be housed. Professor Greenberg, who is, of course, associated with Justice Health, will, no doubt, liaise with the relevant persons charged with the care of Mr Wilson. 

28What should be said, however, is that it is clearly in the interests of Mr Wilson, in the public interest and in the interests of the administration of justice that a process be undertaken and maintained where he receives appropriate treatment, including medication, which will assist the conduct of the special hearing. Between now and 4 November 2013, it is more than highly desirable that the process of treatment discussed by Professor Greenberg be maintained. 

29In accordance with s.30(2)(a) MH(FP) Act, I direct that a special hearing be conducted with respect to Mr Wilson in connection with the charges brought against him, being charges of murder, solicit to murder and commit act intended to cause a person to give false evidence. 

30I confirm the listing of that special hearing to take place at the Supreme Court sitting at Nowra commencing on 4 November 2013. 

31I recommend that the treatment of Mr Wilson in the meantime take into account the matters outlined in the report of Professor David Greenberg dated 5 September 2013, a copy of which will be provided to any relevant authorities to assist compliance with this recommendation. 

32Bail is refused.

		11 November 2013",2013-09-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706212,Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of R A Hulme J. I agree with his Honour's analysis and the orders he proposes. In relation to Ground 1, I note that the Crown initially sought to challenge the correctness of previous decisions of this Court that hold that the aggravating feature specified in s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (that the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person) does not extend to offences committed in the home of the victim if the offender lives in the same home. The Crown expressly abandoned that challenge. Why that course was taken is not apparent.

2I understand R A Hulme J to have expressed some reservations about the principle stated. I share those reservations. It is, perhaps, time for re-examination by this Court of those previous decisions. 

3PRICE J: I agree with R A Hulme J and the additional remarks of Simpson J.

4R A HULME J: Peter Melbom (""the applicant"") stabbed a man in the chest. Then when the man's partner said she was going to call the police, he held a knife at her throat and said, ""I'll slice your throat too"" and ""I'll kill you too"". 

5The applicant pleaded guilty to offences of reckless wounding (count 1) and threatening to use an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence (count 2). 

6Reckless wounding is an offence against s 35(4) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for seven years and there is a standard non-parole period of three years. Threatening to use an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence is an offence against s 33B(1)(b). The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 12 years and there is no standard non-parole period.

7The applicant was sentenced by her Honour Judge Syme in the Sydney District Court on 1 March 2012. For the offence of threatening to use an offensive weapon he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years and 4 months to commence on 25 March 2011. For the offence of reckless wounding he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 10 months and 15 days. The latter sentence was specified to commence on 25 September 2011. Accordingly, the total effective sentence was one of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months and 15 days. The applicant will become eligible for release on parole on 8 August 2014.

8Leave is sought to appeal on the following grounds:

1. The learned judge erred in law in taking into account as aggravating factors that the offences were committed in the residence of the offender and the victims.

2. The sentence imposed in relation to Count 1 is manifestly excessive.

Facts

9There were agreed facts before the sentencing judge from which I draw the following.

10The victims were Mr Neil Barbar and Ms Lorna Hines. They had been in a relationship for quite some time and had four children together. Mr Barbar had known the applicant for a considerably longer period of time. In late February 2011, he was permitted to move in to the victims' unit in Waterloo. 

11Some time during the day on Wednesday 23 March 2011, a lengthy argument commenced between the applicant and the victims in relation to a mobile phone that he offered to Ms Hines for sale. The argument continued into the night. At about 1.00am the applicant told the victims that he was going to visit somebody ""just down the road"" and that, ""I'll be able to get on"". He returned to the unit at about 5.00am and it was noted that his eyes were bloodshot and he could not stand still. He lay on the lounge and went to sleep.

12At about 10.30am on 24 March, the applicant and Mr Barbar began to argue, again about the phone. The argument became physical and there was some punching. It culminated in the applicant telling Mr Barbar that he did not want to fight anymore. He also mentioned that he would pack his things and leave.

13Mr Barbar went to the kitchen to get a drink and whilst his back was turned the applicant obtained a pocket knife from his bum bag. Ms Hines called out, ""he's got a knife"". The applicant rushed at Mr Barbar and stabbed him to the left rib cage. Ms Hines told the applicant that she was going to call the police and he said, ""Do it you dog. You're a dog. ... You ring the dogs and I'll slice your throat too. ... Stay out of my way or I'll kill you too"".

14Ms Hines ran to a neighbour's unit and called the police and they attended a short time later. The applicant still had the knife in his hand. The police found it necessary to spray the applicant with capsicum spray and wrestle him to the ground before he was handcuffed and taken into custody. He was taken to Redfern Police Station. He declined to participate in a recorded interview, but did state, ""I had a blackout. I don't remember nothing"".

15Mr Barbar was taken to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for treatment. A chest drain was inserted to the left chest which drained two litres of blood. He became unstable and required immediate transfer for emergency surgery where a left thoracotomy was performed. It was found that the single stab wound had traversed his chest wall and entered into the pleural space around the lung. A chest wall artery had been transected and was bleeding briskly. The bleeding was stopped and no injury to the lung was found. Mr Barbar was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for postoperative recovery. He was discharged from hospital five days later.

Subjective features

16The applicant was aged 32 at the time of the offence. He had a criminal history which commenced at the age of 18. The history includes a variety of offences but notably two of carrying a cutting weapon or knife, two of possessing or using a prohibited weapon without a permit, as well as offences of assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and robbery. There are also multiple entries for possessing prohibited drugs or prescribed restricted substances. The applicant had served a number of periods of imprisonment, the longest being a term of 18 months with a non-parole period of 12 months.

17In 2004, the applicant was placed on a good behaviour bond with a condition requiring him to comply with the requirements of the Salvation Army Bridge Program. Later that year he was placed on another good behaviour bond, this time requiring him to complete the WHOS Methadone To Abstinence Residence program. In 2005, he was placed on yet another good behaviour bond pursuant to a suspended sentence of imprisonment and on this occasion he was required to comply with all reasonable directions in relation to counselling; educational development; or drug and alcohol rehabilitation. When sentenced to his longest term of imprisonment in 2006, it was a condition of his parole that he be ""subject to supervision, particularly in respect to drug use"".

18The applicant was refused bail when he was charged with robbery in April 2010. He was almost immediately referred for assessment by a mental health clinical nurse consultant because of his ""agitated presentation"". A short report by the nurse indicated that the applicant presented with residual effects of methamphetamine intoxication and opiate withdrawal. There was no evidence of mental illness. Documentation available to the nurse indicated previous psychiatric admissions due to mental disorder in the context of amphetamine intoxication and Borderline and Dependent Personality Disorder.

19A report by Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, was in evidence. The history the applicant gave to Dr Nielssen included that he had been a regular cannabis user since about the age of 16. He commenced using heroin at about age 17. He had been taking methadone for 10 years. The applicant also reported the abuse of stimulant drugs, mainly methamphetamine (ice) from the age of 16. He told Dr Nielssen that ice ""was probably his drug of choice"". 

20He recounted to Dr Nielssen his various past attempts at drug rehabilitation programs. In that context he said that although he did not complete the WHOS program, it had helped him to stay free of drugs for six months and out of gaol for three years.

21The applicant's parents separated when he was three years old and he had little contact with his father since. His mother remarried into a stable relationship. He reported having a happy childhood and being well cared for. After leaving school he was trained as a screen printer and graphic designer. However, he told Dr Nielssen that his main interest in life was substance abuse and that he had not worked for a long time.

22Dr Nielssen made a diagnosis of ""substance dependence and abuse disorder"" on the basis of the applicant's longstanding opiate dependence and pattern of daily use of cannabis. He noted a history of abuse of stimulant drugs and anxiety-relieving sedative medication. Dr Nielssen also made a diagnosis of a probable underlying relapsing psychotic illness. That was based on a history of five admissions to psychiatric wards in the previous three years for treatment of psychosis; the applicant's account of experiencing symptoms of psychosis or delirium in the weeks after his reception into prison; and the long-term treatment with antipsychotic medication. There was also a diagnosis of probable hypoxic brain injury on the basis of the applicant's account of drug overdoses for which he required resuscitation; his reported decline in mental performance in the last three years; and aspects of his presentation during his interview with Dr Nielssen. He had exhibited slurred speech and a slowing of responses consistent with some form of brain injury.

23Dr Nielssen said it was of concern that, while abusing drugs that had the effect of increasing suspicion and reducing inhibition, the applicant seemed to have a habit of carrying knives. He recommended that the applicant complete a drug rehabilitation program and have close monitoring of his abstinence from methamphetamine and benzodiazepine drugs after his release. 

24Dr Nielssen concluded his report by noting that it carried the limitation that it was based solely upon the history provided by the applicant and did not take into account documentation as to medical observations made at the time of the applicant's reception to prison or during admissions to psychiatric hospitals in the community.

25Clinical notes from the applicant's Justice Health file were also in evidence. They include a history given by the applicant soon after coming into custody for the present offences of extensive substance use in the immediate past: Xanax, ice, cocaine and cannabis. It was noted that he was on a relatively high level of methadone and there was a history of heroin overdosing. There was also recorded a history of paranoia, depression and suicidal ideation. The notes record an ""impression"" of substance dependence but that the applicant was ""not currently psychotic"". 

26The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings.

The remarks on sentence

27The sentencing judge noted the terms of the charges, the applicable maximum penalties, and the standard non-parole period for the wounding offence. 

28Her Honour recounted the facts and then turned to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. She noted features such as that there was single punch with a pocket knife after an argument but in a completely unprovoked attack; that the degree of foreseeability that a wounding would occur was high; and that the consequences of the conduct were serious in that they could have been life threatening, although her Honour noted that there was no evidence of residual damage. Her Honour noted that there was nothing that would suggest the applicant did not understand what he was doing. She noted that he was intoxicated by drugs, and had claimed that he had a blackout and could not remember what had happened. Her Honour also noted from her close reading of Dr Nielssen's report that there was nothing to suggest that the applicant was experiencing a psychotic reaction as a result of drug induced intoxication. 

29Her Honour took into account, as what she termed an ""aggravating feature"", that the offence was committed in the home of the victims. That reference is the subject of the first ground of appeal and will be discussed in that context. In the applicant's favour her Honour took into account that the offence appeared to have been a relatively spontaneous event and not the subject of any planning or premeditation. Ultimately, her Honour announced her view that the wounding offence was ""in the midrange of seriousness or very close to it"".

30Her Honour said there was no evidence of mental illness and no evidence to suggest that the applicant did not understand that the offence was a serious one and that his behaviour was criminal. The applicant's record demonstrated that the offence was not out of character but she did not regard this as an aggravating circumstance. It did, however, have the effect that leniency could not be extended to him as it had been in the past by way of imposition of s 9 good behaviour bonds or good behaviour bonds pursuant to suspended sentences of imprisonment. 

31Her Honour observed that, ""the tragedy of Mr Melbom's position is that he appears to be overwhelmed by his use of drugs and powerless or completely unmotivated to do anything about it"". In relation to what the applicant told Dr Nielssen about the interaction of drug abuse and the offences, she observed, ""It seems that the offender uses his drug use as an excuse for his behaviour"".

32Her Honour was unable to identify any evidence of remorse. She was unable to make a finding that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend due to a lack of evidence. She was similarly unable to make a finding that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. Her Honour found nothing in Dr Nielssen's report that gave any cause for hope that the applicant was motivated to address his drug use. She concluded that until he did address his drug use his prospects of rehabilitation were ""not good"".

33Specific deterrence was mentioned and again her Honour noted the applicant's low prospects of rehabilitation unless he addressed his drug issue. Protection of the community was mentioned, with her Honour remarking that the applicant had an ""escalating rate of offending"".

34Finally, her Honour referred to the second charge of threatening to use an offensive weapon. The weapon used was a knife and it was a threat to kill if a call was made to the police. She remarked that the first offence had shown that the applicant was capable of carrying out that threat, thus increasing the fear for the victim at the time: ""the threat was real"". Her Honour then said that the ""fear would have been significant and the weapon and the proximity of the offender to the victim are all matters that increase the objective seriousness of that offence"".

Ground 1: Error in taking into account that the offences were committed in the home of the offender and the victims

35Relevant to this ground of appeal is the following from the remarks on sentence:

I also take into account when considering aggravating circumstances that this offence was committed in the home of the offender. Both offences were committed against both his housemates. There is an element of domestic violence therefore in this offence and offences which have domestic violence as a feature of them are considered more serious. That is because the victims of such an offence really had, in effect, nowhere to go because the domestic relationship, even between housemates, is such that there is a special geographical vulnerability for the victims, but also in infrequent occasions a vulnerability to assist their friends and housemates.

The personal relationship that existed between these people is not known. Therefore, the main aggravating feature is that the offence was committed in the residence of the victims where the offender had otherwise a right to be, which made him more dangerous. (Emphasis added)

36It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that her Honour's approach was contrary to authority: Ingham v R [2011] NSWCCA 88 at [111]-[112]; EK v R [2010] NSWCCA 199; (2010) 79 NSWLR 740 at [79]; and R v Gazi Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125 at [29].

37Counsel for the Crown contended that despite the judge using the expression ""aggravating circumstances"" her Honour should not be thought to have regarded the matter as falling within the list of aggravating features set out in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). That provision, relevantly, is in the following terms:


(2) Aggravating factors
The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:

...

(eb) The offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person.

38The Crown submitted that it was significant that the judge made no express reference to that provision. Accordingly, despite the terminology employed by the judge, she was in reality referring to this matter as a feature relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences, it being a matter of significance because of the particular vulnerability of the victims, a vulnerability enhanced by the applicant's lawful presence in their home. On that basis, it was submitted that the judge did not fall into the error as asserted by applicant.

39An alternative argument that, even if the judge had regarded the matter as being an aggravating feature pursuant to s 21A(2)(eb) her Honour would not have been in error, was set out at length in the written submissions but expressly abandoned shortly before the hearing of the application.

40In oral argument, counsel for the applicant submitted that it was immaterial whether or not the judge had regard to the statutory provision. The common law also reflected the idea that it was an aggravating factor where an offender intruded into the home but not where the offender and the victim reside together: EK at [79].

41When asked by the presiding judge to formulate the principle, counsel for the applicant responded to the effect that it can never be an aggravating factor where the offence is committed in the home in which both the offender and victim reside (T2.36). That extended to the not infrequently seen case of repeated sexual abuse of a child in the home in which both the child and the perpetrator lived (T3.24). (Aggravation in those circumstances was argued to flow from the relationship of trust.)

Determination of Ground 1

42Subsection (2)(eb) was inserted in s 21A by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007 (NSW) and took effect on 1 January 2008.

43It has been held in this Court that this provision, and the earlier common law, did not provide that it was an aggravating factor when an offence is committed in the home in which both the offender and the victim reside; it is only an aggravating factor when the offender is an intruder: see the authorities referred to by the applicant (above at [35]) as well as R v BIP [2011] NSWCCA 224 at [60]-[61]; R v MH [2011] NSWCCA 230 at [34]; NLR v R [2011] NSWCCA 246 at [22]; DS v R [2012] NSWCCA 159 at [144]-[148]; and Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [72]-[73]. 

44The Crown abandoned its proposed alternative argument in relation to this ground and conceded the correctness of those decisions. This is despite the fact that the plain words of s 21A(2)(eb) do not support the limitation that this Court has placed on their application. It is also despite the fact that it was never intended by Parliament that there should be the constraint upon their application that this Court has imposed: see the second reading speech of the Attorney-General, New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates, Hansard, 17 October 2007 (p 2667ff) where it was said that it would be ""an aggravating circumstance when victims are assaulted in their own homes ... even if it is also the home of the accused"". However, given the concession by the Crown, now is not the occasion for reconsideration of what has been said previously in this Court on the subject.

45The sequence in which the sentencing judge referred to various potential aggravating and mitigating factors indicates to me that, whilst she did not refer to the statutory provisions, she must specifically have had regard to them because she referred to them in exactly the same order in which those factors are listed in ss 21A(2) and (3). In these circumstances it seems likely that her Honour had her eye on s 21A(2)(eb) when she made the remarks about the offences being ""committed in the home of the offender"". But there are some other features of the sentence proceedings and the sentencing remarks that should be noted.

46The written submissions for the applicant to her Honour included under the heading ""Vulnerability of Victim"" that ""the victims ... were in their own home at the time of the offence"". 

47It must be borne in mind as well that her Honour received the evidence and heard submissions; retired to read some authorities that had been provided by the applicant's representative; and then delivered ex tempore remarks on sentence. There are frequent statements in the judgments of this Court about not taking an overly analytical approach to sentencing remarks delivered in this fashion: see, for example, R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at [48] per Spigelman CJ.

48It is also worth noting that one of the authorities provided to her Honour by the applicant's representative was OH Hyunwook v R [2010] NSWCCA 148. In that case the offence occurred in a home in which the offender lived and in which the victim was a temporary resident. The relevant ground of appeal asserted that the sentencing judge had erred in regarding the fact that the offence was committed at the home of the victim as ""important"". Kirby J, with the concurrence of Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) and Johnson J, said (at [39]):

Dealing with these submissions, his Honour, when he began his sentencing remarks, did describe the offence as ""domestic violence related"" (ROS 1). However, in the passage relied upon, his Honour did not say that he regarded the location (being within the victim's temporary home) as a matter of aggravation. Indeed, it is noteworthy that the ground of appeal does not assert that there was error in regarding the location as a matter of aggravation. It asserted error in regarding it as ""important"". In my view, it was clearly a relevant circumstance. It was open to his Honour to regard it as important. Instead of the victim being treated cordially in what had become his temporary home, he was subjected to violence. There was no error. (Emphasis added)

49A not dissimilar analysis of how a sentencing judge regarded the fact that an offence was committed in a home occupied by both the offender and victim occurred in DJM v R [2013] NSWCCA 101. That case concerned sexual assaults by a stepfather of his stepdaughter in the family home. The relevant statement by the sentencing judge was set out in the judgment of Blanch J at [7]:

Each of the offences was committed in the home of the offender, but due to the nature of the custody arrangements, it was also the home of the complainant, for the period of access. Effectively the victim had no place have (sic) safely to escape to. This is an aggravating circumstance.

50It was contended that the judge must have had in mind s 21A(2)(eb) and that taking into account that the offences were committed in the home was contrary to authority. However, Blanch J (with the concurrence of Basten JA and Simpson J) characterised what the judge said otherwise (at [9]-[10]):

In my view the statement by the sentencing judge did not have reference to this aspect of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act at all. In the course of her remarks, the judge noted that it was an obvious aggravating feature where the offender was in a position of trust and that the abuse of trust is considered to be more serious where the offender is the father or family member. Her Honour quoted the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Hudson (Court of Criminal Appeal New South Wales, Spigelman CJ, Sully, Ireland JJ, 30 July 1998, unreported) at 3 that ""... children in a family situation are virtually helpless against sexual attack by the male parent..."" and a similar statement in R v BJW [2000] NSWCCA 60; 112 A Crim R 1 where Sheller JA at [21] referred to the fact that ""... a child aged 13 or younger is virtually helpless in the family unit when sexually abused by a step-parent.""

The comments made by the sentencing judge that the victim had no place of safety to escape to was nothing more than a statement of the obvious in relation to these sorts of offences committed in the family home and it does not amount to an asserted double counting of the seriousness of the offence.

51In the present case the judge did not simply refer to the bare fact that the offence was committed in the home occupied by the victims and the applicant as an aggravating factor. Her approach would clearly have been contrary to authority if that was all that she had said. But her Honour proceeded to say that the offence had ""an element of domestic violence"". That being so, the offence was more serious ""because the victims of such an offence ... had ... nowhere to go because the domestic relationship, even between housemates, is such that there is a special geographical vulnerability for the victims"". 

52Her Honour concluded the passage in question by referring to the applicant having a right to be in the residence of the victims ""which made him more dangerous"". She did not explain that remark. I think the best view of what her Honour meant was that the offender was armed and volatile and in a relatively confined space with the victims, who were cut off from people in the outside world who may otherwise have intervened.

53These were all matters that were relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of the offence. If the introductory words ""this offence was committed in the home of the offender"" did not appear, the passage in question would be beyond criticism. The reasoning that followed those words provided the real explanation of her Honour's assessment of the circumstances that rendered the offences more serious. I do not believe that the introductory words had any material bearing upon sentence.

54A final matter to note is that the impugned passage appeared in the context of her Honour's assessment of matters relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence in count 1. If she had erroneously taken into account an aggravating feature it would be expected to have led her to overstate the objective seriousness. But her assessment was that it was ""in the mid-range of seriousness or very close to it"". That was consistent with, or modestly less than, the assessment advocated on behalf of the applicant: ""at least in the mid-range of objective seriousness"" (AB 63.21). 

55In light of all these matters, if there was error, it had no real bearing upon the outcome.

Ground 2: The sentence for the reckless wounding offence was manifestly excessive

56Counsel for the applicant referred to the judge having allowed a 20 per cent reduction on account of the applicant's plea of guilty before imposing a sentence of four years for the offence of reckless wounding. Accordingly, it was submitted, the nominal starting point for the sentence must have been five years. It was submitted that, against a maximum penalty of seven years, this indicated a sentence that was out of proportion, and manifestly excessive, when regard is had to the judge's finding that the offence was of midrange seriousness or very close to it.

57It was submitted that the error asserted under Ground 1 ""tainted"" the assessment of objective seriousness and ""must have had a significant impact on the determination of the appropriate sentence"". 

58It was also submitted that the judge had mistaken the facts in finding that ""there is no evidence of mental illness"". It was submitted that this finding ignored the diagnosis made by Dr Nielssen. In oral submissions it was contended the applicant's mental condition was relevant in a general sense to his subjective case. It was ""a circumstance of personal difficulty and disadvantage that has been ... a significant feature in his background"" (T6.3). It warranted ""some weight and some degree of compassion"" (T9.10). 

59It was also submitted that in making adverse findings as to the applicant's motivation to address his drug dependency issues, the judge had not taken into consideration the history of past attempts at drug rehabilitation programs as set out in the report of Dr Nielssen. It also failed to have regard to the applicant's claim to Dr Nielssen that he had been drug free for the nine months that he had been in gaol and planned to make a further attempt at drug rehabilitation. 

60Finally, it was submitted that her Honour had not taken into consideration whether special circumstances warranted a variation in the usual parole/non-parole ratio. It was acknowledged that her Honour was not asked to make a variation but the submission was pressed nonetheless. The applicant's mental condition and his need for a longer period of supervision on parole to avoid relapsing into drug use were identified in oral submissions as relevant in this context.

61The Crown challenged the contention that a notional starting point of five years against the maximum penalty of seven years was out of keeping with a finding of objective seriousness of ""in the mid-range of seriousness or very close to it"". Such an approach was unduly mathematical; it is not axiomatic that a mid-range offence must attract a mid-range sentence. 

62The Crown submitted that it was not incumbent upon the judge to have found that there was a mental condition that was relevant to sentence in any of the ways identified by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]. There was no evidence that established in a satisfactory way any of the propositions there listed. It was also submitted that even if the applicant was suffering from some mental condition it did not follow that consequences would automatically follow in the assessment of sentence: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68 per Gleeson CJ.

63In oral submissions, the Crown contended that her Honour's sentencing remarks demonstrated that she regarded the applicant's mental condition as being directly related to his drug use. The judge referred to Dr Nielssen's report as including that the applicant had experienced on several prior occasions a psychotic reaction as a result of drug-induced intoxication. And she assessed his rehabilitation prospects as ""not good"", ""fairly low"" and ""dim"" until he was motivated to address his drug use. That pessimistic view was consistent with a concession made by the applicant's representative, who accepted her Honour's suggestion during the course of submissions that ""the information that I have before me is not hopeful in terms of rehabilitation"" (AB 62.35).

64The Crown submitted that it was evident that the judge did have regard to the question of whether there were special circumstances that would warrant a reduction in the non-parole period, notwithstanding that no submission was made on the applicant's behalf. She made specific reference to the need to make an adjustment because of the partial accumulation of sentences, showing that the provisions of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were not forgotten by her Honour. 

Determination of Ground 2

65It follows from what I have said about Ground 1 that I do not accept the submission that her Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence was ""tainted"" by the error there asserted. 

66Her Honour's statement ""there is no evidence of mental illness"" should not be read literally or out of context. It was open to her Honour to take the view that there was no standalone mental illness and that the difficulties the applicant faced in that respect were a direct result of his substance abuse over a lengthy period of his life. This was the critical feature of the applicant's subjective case. He had a number of opportunities in the past to engage with rehabilitation. He told Dr Nielssen that although he did not complete the WHOS program, it had helped him to stay free of drugs for six months and out of gaol for three years. But then he returned to serious offending when in April 2010 he committed the offence of robbery. He was on a methadone program at the time he committed the subject offences in March 2011 but was also continuing to abuse illicit substances. 

67In the light of this lengthy history of substance abuse and offending, particularly violent offending, it was well open to her Honour to view the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation as being poor. 

68There was very little else standing in the applicant's favour. Her Honour referred to him having family support and noted the presence of his mother in court. She referred to it being ""important for a court to address the need for rehabilitation"" but she also had regard to the need for specific deterrence and protection of the community. In relation to the latter she noted ""his escalating rate of offending"". 

69The seriousness of the offences cannot be gainsaid. The applicant stabbed the male victim in the chest and then threatened to kill the female victim when holding a knife to her throat. The stabbing resulted in a severed chest wall artery that brought a need for emergency surgery. Fortunately there was no damage to the lungs or other organs. Dr Nielssen was rightly concerned about the applicant abusing drugs that increased suspicion and reduced inhibition and, in that context, his habit of carrying knives.

70In my view, the sentence for the offence of reckless wounding was at the upper end of the range of a permissible exercise of her Honour's sentencing discretion. 

71That is sufficient to deal with this ground of appeal but one further observation should be made. The offence of threatening to use an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence was a serious offence in itself. In fact, the maximum penalty for it was significantly higher than that for the wounding offence. The partial accumulation of the sentences has the result that the applicant was required to serve only an additional six months for it.

72The sentence for the offence of reckless wounding, whilst severe, was ameliorated by the relatively modest degree of accumulation upon the sentence for the other offence committed in respect of a different victim. In the end, the overall sentence was well open to her Honour to impose in order to reflect the totality of criminality. 

73I would reject ground 2.

2706215,Andrew Smith v R [2013] NSWCCA 209,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R A HULME J: Andrew Smith (""the applicant"") seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Marien SC in the District Court at Griffith on 12 September 2012.

3The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to one count of aggravated breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence, namely, intimidation. The circumstance of aggravation pleaded was that he knew that persons were present within the dwelling house.

4The offence was in contravention of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years under Div 1A Pt 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The maximum penalty for an offence of intimidation under s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal) Violence Act 2007 (NSW) is imprisonment for 5 years and/or a fine of 50 penalty units.

5His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 4 years 2 months comprised of a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months commencing 10 December 2011 and expiring 9 September 2014, with a balance of term of 1 year 5 months expiring 9 February 2016. This sentence was the product of his Honour allowing for a reduction of 25 per cent on account of the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty. A finding of special circumstances (s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) was made arising from the applicant's need for extended supervision on parole.

6At the applicant's request, his Honour took into account two further offences on a Form 1, namely damaging property and contravening an apprehended domestic violence order. Those offences arose out of the same circumstances that gave rise to the principal offence.

7His Honour also dealt with breaches of two good behaviour bonds (s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). The bonds had been entered at the Balranald Local Court on 7 December 2011 for two offences of common assault (s 61 Crimes Act), both committed against the same victim who was also the victim of the s 112(2) offence. In respect of each matter his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for 10 months commencing 10 December 2011 and expiring 9 October 2012, to be served wholly concurrently with the sentence for the principal offence.

Facts

8There were agreed facts before the sentencing judge from which I have derived the following.

9The applicant and the complainant, Ms Alyce Shalliker, were in a domestic relationship and lived at a home in Balranald. The relationship broke down in September 2011. Ms Shalliker continued to live at the home. Mr Bradley Brumby moved in as a housemate but in around November 2011, began a relationship with Ms Shalliker.

10At about 5.15am on 10 December 2011, Ms Shalliker and Mr Brumby were asleep in the master bedroom. They were woken by noises from the outside and got up and went to the lounge room. They saw the applicant attempting to enter through a window. They successfully prevented him doing so. The applicant walked away and Ms Shalliker closed and locked the window. Mr Brumby left the home via the back door to summon help from Ms Shalliker's father who lived nearby. 

11Meanwhile, Ms Shalliker heard the front door handle being turned and then up to ten loud bangs before the front door was flung open. She barricaded herself behind the door from the verandah to the lounge room and braced her legs against the architrave of the bedroom door. She felt the door being kicked from the opposite side and heard the applicant yelling, ""where is he, I'm gonna get him"". 

12The applicant kicked the internal door with such force that parts of the top half of it caved in on top of Ms Shalliker with a piece of wood hitting her on the top of the head. As a result of her bracing herself against the door the applicant was momentarily stuck and he swung at the kitchen door, punching two holes in it. (The foregoing is literally what the agreed facts describe. The layout of the house is difficult to picture and how the applicant gained entry to the house is unclear.)

13The applicant broke off the top half of that door and entered the kitchen with Ms Shalliker following him. He said, ""you're a slut"" and hit her to the back of the head. He then said, ""I am going to stab you"". Ms Shalliker saw a large knife in the kitchen sink and ran straight out the back door, up the driveway and hid next door. 

14From that position Ms Shalliker heard banging and about five minutes later saw the applicant walking away. She returned to her home and saw that there was damage to two doors, the television was broken and her computer had been thrown on the floor. The fridge had been upended, a glass table was also upended and the drawers from her bedroom furniture were opened and some broken. 

15Mr Brumby returned to the home and saw that a utility parked in the driveway belonging to Ms Shalliker's grandfather had a smashed window. This is the offence of damaging property that was on the Form 1.

16Police were called and when they arrived they saw the damage to the utility and to various items inside the home. On 10 December 2011, the applicant was arrested and taken to the Balranald police station. There he told relatives in the presence of a police officer:

I fucked up, I smashed the house up, you should have seen the cunt run when I put my head inside the house, he had sparks coming off his thongs, the dog cunt. I'll plead guilty, I fucked up so I'll plead guilty. What am I supposed to do when the cunt has been running around behind my back for the past 9 months with that other cunt.

17He then turned to the officer who was present and said:

I was gunna run from you's but I thought I would face up to what I have done, because I'm remorseful.

Breach of bond offences

18I have earlier mentioned that the judge also dealt with the breach of two good behaviour bonds entered at the Balranald Local Court on 7 December 2011 in respect of offences of assault. The facts pertaining to those offences were not provided to the Court but they were summarised in the written submissions for the applicant.

19The first of these assaults occurred on 26 August 2011 when the applicant arrived home at about 11.30pm and argued with Ms Shalliker. In the course of this he shook her and she sustained a blow to the left eye causing it to blacken.

20The second offence occurred on 3 September 2011 when the applicant and Ms Shalliker again argued. In the course of this the complainant referred to the applicant in a derogatory and offensive fashion and in response he pushed her and she pushed him back. They then wrestled on the floor. He took hold of her but she managed to extricate herself and escape. It would seem that the breakdown in the relationship occurred at that stage and an Apprehended Violence Order, at least on an interim basis, was put in place.

Subjective circumstances

21The applicant was born in 1973 and so he was aged 38 at the time of the offences.

22The applicant's criminal history commenced with matters in a Children's Court in 1987. As an adult he has been dealt with on many occasions in the Magistrates' Court of Victoria and the Local Court of New South Wales. The record contains about 15 entries for offences of violence and there are also entries for damaging property and for firearms and related offences. He has been imprisoned on a number of occasions. 

23The applicant derived from an Aboriginal family. He was the youngest of three children born in Barmedman. The family lived on a farm. His parents separated when he was aged four. The reason for his parents' separation was his father's alcohol abuse. 

24His mother moved the family to Melbourne where they remained until he was aged six. At that time she remarried and the family moved to Wagga Wagga. 

25The applicant is said to have been traumatised after his mother's remarriage and the birth of his half-brother. He required counselling over several months. His mother indicated that his literacy problems commenced at that time. The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge that he had difficulties learning to read at school. He left school being unable to read or write and remained illiterate. 

26The applicant left his mother's home and school at the age of 14 and went to live with his natural father. He worked with him doing fencing, stock work and shearing. He was taught to fish and hunt. He continued to pursue these activities as a hobby in his adult years.

27The applicant played football when a teenager and occasionally was paid for playing. He gave evidence that at the age of about 17 or 18 he undertook a horse training course which was offered to Aboriginal children. The course involved doing stock work as well as training race horses. He trained a number of horses to sell at rodeos. He received a certificate upon completion. Thereafter he obtained work in Alice Springs, doing stock work and training race horses. A reference was tendered about the training course and it was to the effect that the applicant had excelled in every category. The author of the reference, Ms Mary Newcombe, indicated that she had maintained contact with the applicant and his mother and she clearly had a high regard for his ability.

28The applicant's mother and stepfather separated when he was aged 29. He maintained a good relationship with both of them. 

29The applicant's evidence included that he had been in steady employment, mostly as a shearer. At the time of the offences he was working with a shearing contractor who had told the author of a Pre-Sentence Report that the applicant had an excellent work ethic. The employer was willing to re-employ him, provided that he addressed his problem with excessive alcohol consumption.

30The applicant had a history of drug and alcohol dependence and what the author of the Pre-Sentence Report described as ""associated criminal behaviour"". He commenced smoking cannabis at the age of 13 and was dependent upon this substance until recent years when he reduced his consumption to a modest level.

31The Pre-Sentence Report referred to the applicant having experienced two significant relationships. He had two children in the first relationship who had until recently been in the care of their mother, but are now in foster care. The other significant relationship was with the complainant. That relationship had lasted for three years. The applicant gave evidence that they had a home together and he had thought the relationship was going well. He had been travelling a lot with his work and had been told by friends that the complainant had been unfaithful to him. He confronted the complainant about it and said that she ""broke down crying and saying she didn't want to hurt me"".

32The applicant gave evidence about the events leading up to the offence of 10 December 2011. He said that he finished work at about 6pm and had a few beers with the owner of the property where he had been working. He then went to a hotel and then home. He had a shower and returned to the hotel where he remained until it closed. He said that he was very drunk and that after the hotel closed he went to a friend's place and continued drinking. He said that he could not remember much after that.

33The applicant's evidence was that he would not normally get ""that drunk"" and that he was ""stressed out"" because he had been in court a few days before and that he was ""broken hearted"" about the break-up of his relationship with Ms Shalliker. He acknowledged, however, that Ms Shalliker would have felt worse than him and would have been very scared by his actions. He accepted responsibility for the offence from the very beginning from the time the police had spoken to him. He gave evidence of his remorse. 

34The applicant was held in gaol since his arrest. During that time he had completed a drug and alcohol prevention program for which he received a certificate. He also placed before the court a letter which he had dictated to someone in gaol. In that letter he said that he had done a lot of thinking in the time that he had been in gaol about what he had done that was wrong. He wanted to get back to work to support his mother and his children. He was particularly anxious to send his children away to college to get them a good education. 

35The applicant also gave evidence that he accepted that the relationship with Ms Shalliker was over.

Ground 1: His Honour erred in finding as a specific feature of aggravation that ""this was an offence constituting domestic violence""

36Counsel for the applicant referred to a number of aspects of the approach taken by the sentencing judge to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. 

37In the remarks on sentence the judge referred to the following matters in this context:


The offence involved the forceful invasion of the complainant's house by the applicant in terrifying circumstances.


The offender destroyed property and assaulted the complainant and threatened to stab her, causing her to flee the home and hide next-door. 


The circumstance of aggravation pleaded was that the applicant knew that there were persons present within the home (s 105A(1)(f)).


A further matter of aggravation was that at the time of the offence the applicant used corporal violence (s 105A(1)(c)) in hitting Ms Shalliker to the back of the head after threatening her.


The applicant invaded the home of the complainant. 


The offence was committed in the context of domestic violence.

38The contention was that the judge erred by taking into account ""as a separate feature of aggravation which increased the objective seriousness of the offence"" that the offence was one of domestic violence. It was submitted that this involved double counting because the fact of the offence involving domestic violence was already reflected in a number of features.

39The first matter relied upon was that the serious indictable offence committed consequent upon the break and enter was one of intimidation contrary to s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal) Violence Act. However, in relation to that I accept the Crown's submission which was to the effect that the offence of intimidation is not limited to conduct in a domestic violence context. Where it occurs in a domestic violence context there is an added dimension to the seriousness of the matter.

40The second feature was that the judge took into account an offence on the Form 1 of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order. Again, I do not regard that as involving double counting. Contravening an apprehended domestic violence order does not necessarily involve the commission of an offence in the nature of domestic violence. There are other, non-violent, ways in which such an order can be contravened. In any event, I know of no prohibition upon taking into account the circumstances underpinning an offence taken into account on a Form 1 when assessing the objective seriousness of the primary offence. (No authority was cited.) Obviously when that is done, care is needed in evaluating the extent to which the sentence for the primary offence might be increased by virtue of there being another offence taken into account.

41It should be borne in mind that it was at the applicant's request that the judge took into account the contravention of the ADVO when sentencing for the principal offence. No complaint is raised about the manner in which his Honour did so; nor is it contended that the influence it had upon the assessment of sentence for the principal offence was in any way erroneous.

42The third feature was said to be that ""the motivation for the applicant's entrance to the premises was the breakdown of the domestic relationship and its sequelae"". The circumstance of aggravation pleaded in the charge was that the applicant knew that there were persons inside. As I understand the submission, it was contended that having regard to both matters was, in effect, to have regard to the same thing.

43I do not accept that there was double counting in this respect. The circumstance of aggravation of knowing a person is inside the premises into which an offender breaks and enters is not limited to domestic violence situations. The domestic violence aspect was an additional element that operated in aggravation in this case. 

44Finally it was submitted that the judge erred by taking into account as an aggravating feature that the offence was committed in the victim's home, which was an element of the offence. The problem for the applicant in this respect is that in the written submissions provided by his then legal representative to the sentencing judge, it was conceded on the authority of this Court's judgment in Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA 142 at [21]-[22] that this was an additional aggravating feature.

45In Palijan the offender broke into the home of a woman with whom he had previously been in a relationship. He was sentenced for an offence of break, enter and commit serious indictable offence, namely intimidation, in circumstances of aggravation, namely the infliction of corporal violence. There was also an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The first ground of appeal was that the judge erred when finding that the fact that the home broken into was the victim's home was an aggravating feature. 

46Barr AJ, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreed, held that the element of breaking and entering in s 112(2) of the Crimes Act does not require that the premises be the home of the victim. Regard was had to s 21A(2)(eb) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

47The concession by the applicant's representative in the court below was appropriate and no error is disclosed in the judge taking this matter into account, along with all of the other matters he mentioned, in his assessment of the seriousness of the offence.

48I am not persuaded that there was any double counting in any of the respects contended. I would not uphold Ground 1. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence

49The submissions for the applicant referred to two features to support the proposition that his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence was erroneous. They were that the offence was not planned or premeditated and that the offence was committed under the combined impact of emotional instability and excessive alcohol consumption.

50The first thing to be observed is that the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is uniquely a matter for the discretion of a sentencing judge, a matter with which this court will not lightly interfere. For example, in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] Spigelman CJ said:

Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion.

51 Simpson J ""emphatically"" agreed and added (at [46]):

The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is quintessentially for the sentencing judge. It is, if not a finding of fact, then the exercise of an evaluative process akin to fact finding or the exercise of a discretion. As such it is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. The importance of respecting the role of a first instance judge should never be underestimated. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view of objective seriousness for that of the first instance judge. That is not because objective seriousness is something determined by reference to the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, in respect of which it is conventionally held that the first instance judge is in a superior position. It is because it is a fundamental aspect of the appellate system. Each judicial officer in the hierarchy has his or her own function, and those at appellate level need to take care not to trespass upon the role of those at first instance.

52The complaint about there being no planning or premeditation was that the judge erred by not making any reference to it. Counsel for the applicant pointed to the fact that the solicitor for the applicant submitted, and the solicitor for the respondent conceded, that this mitigating factor was present. It was also submitted that the failure to take this matter into account supported the complaint of erroneous assessment of objective seriousness. 

53The applicant relied upon Shaw v R [2008] NSWCCA 58 which concerned sentencing for a broadly similar offence against s 112(2). The sentencing judge found that the offence was ""high in the level of seriousness under the section"". The Crown had conceded that the offence was neither planned nor premeditated. Fullerton J (McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreeing) held (at [37]) that the assessment was erroneous and that the finding should have been one of ""middle of the range of offending of its kind"". One of a number of matters that led her Honour to that conclusion was (at [36]):

Were the applicant to have planned a forced entry, armed himself for that purpose, and then used the tool as a weapon to inflict injury, the offence would properly be categorized in that way [that is, as constituting a high level of objective seriousness].

54It was submitted that ""in the same way"" the applicant's case did not have such features and therefore it was wrong for the judge to have found that the offence ""fell in the 'spectrum at a high level'"". 

55I accept that the judge did say that, ""the objective seriousness of the offence does fall in the spectrum at a high level"" but that was in the context of dealing with a submission that was made on the applicant's behalf that the offence fell, ""towards the lower end of the scale but in the lower portion of that lower one third on the scale"". His Honour went on to say:

I believe it falls above the lower one-third on the scale. But I do not find that it is an offence falling in the higher end of the range of objective seriousness. (AB 29)

56In my view, all his Honour was intending to convey was that the objective seriousness was at a higher level than the characterisation advanced on the applicant's behalf. Such a finding was open to his Honour in all the circumstances. 

57In any event, I do not think that there was anything significant in the judge not mentioning the submission (and concession) that there was no planning or premeditation. It is to be noted that the offence was committed at about 5.15 in the morning. Clearly there must have been some forethought by the applicant in going around to the complainant's home. And in any event, offences of this nature are very often committed without any significant planning or premeditation. It was not a matter that reduced the seriousness of the applicant's offence to any material degree.

58The submission in support of the second matter was that whilst intoxication itself is not a reason to mitigate the seriousness of an offence; it is a matter that may be taken into account if it indicates that the offence was impulsive or unplanned or that the offender's capacity to exercise judgment was impaired. In this regard reliance was placed upon what was said in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 per Wood CJ at CL at [397]-[398] and in Waters v R [2007] NSWCCA 219 per James J at [38]. The problem in relation to this submission is that it was not one raised with the sentencing judge. In my view it is inappropriate to raise it for the first time on the hearing of this application: see for example Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44. 

59In any event, the applicant's intoxication did nothing to assist him in the assessment of sentence. The judge said, ""it is clear from his record that he has a lengthy history of serious alcohol abuse in the context of offending"". It did not cause him to act in a way that was ""out of character"". Unless that was established (the applicant bore the onus of proof and did not seek to discharge it) it did nothing other than serve as an explanation for the applicant's conduct: ZZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 83 at [110]-[112] per Johnson J.

60The asserted errors in the exercise of the judge's assessment of the level of objective seriousness of the offence have not been established. I would not uphold this ground.

Ground 3: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive

61In support of this ground it was submitted that his Honour erred in the sense referred to in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499.

62Where patent error is not established, as I believe is the case in relation to the previous grounds, the question is whether the sentence imposed was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"": Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.

63Reference was made by the applicant's counsel to the significant difficulties in life that he had experienced from an early age. These have been referred to in the earlier review of the applicant's subjective case. 

64There was also reference to the finding by the judge that the applicant was remorseful and his acceptance of the need for the applicant to enter into a residential alcohol rehabilitation program. Reference is also made to the applicant having undertaken courses whilst in custody. It was submitted that although no specific finding was made, all of the circumstances supported the proposition that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. 

65Reference was also made to the sentencing statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales for offences committed against s 112(2) and also to a table of comparable cases. Two of the cases in the table were specifically mentioned in oral argument: Shaw, supra, and Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50. It was submitted that both of those cases indicated more serious violence of a domestic violence nature with other aggravating features and yet the ultimate sentences were in the same order or slightly less than the sentence imposed upon the applicant. This, it was submitted, was indicative of the sentences being manifestly excessive. 

66I do not find the statistics to be particularly helpful. There is a substantial number of cases in the database but the range of offending that can be found in offences against s 112(2) is very wide and, of course, the statistics do not disclose anything about the circumstances of the individual offences. The limitations of the use of sentencing statistics were stated in Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]-[55]. I do accept however that in the broad range of sentences that have been imposed, the sentence passed upon the applicant was towards the upper end of the range.

67The ""comparable"" cases to which attention was specifically invited do not support the applicant's proposition. They are but two cases of many. It is difficult to support a proposition that a sentence is manifestly excessive by comparison with so few other cases. 

68The written submissions for the Crown included the following, at [40]-[41]:

As his Honour noted, this offence concerned the violent invasion of the complainant's home in the early hours of the morning. The applicant destroyed and vandalised property and assaulted the complainant. He threatened to stab her. This attack took place with a context of previous domestic violence perpetrated by the applicant on the complainant, in breach of an apprehended violence order and at a time when he was subject to good behaviour bonds.

Considerations of personal and general deterrence were of significance in the sentencing process, as was the protection of the community. The applicant was given the benefit of total concurrency for the sentences imposed for the breaches of the [good behaviour bonds].

69Those submissions are amply supported by authorities concerned with sentencing for offences of a domestic violence nature: see, for example, R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; 164 A Crim R 179 at [65]-[88]; Shaw, supra, at [24]; R v Ball [2013] NSWCCA 126 at [98]; and R v Eckermann [2013] NSWCCA 188 at [54]-[55].

70Deterrence deserved particular attention in the assessment of sentence in this case. The offence was committed only three days after the applicant entered bonds to be of good behaviour for two previous assaults upon the same victim. And the applicant had a significant history of violent offending.

71In my view the sentence passed upon the applicant was a stern one. But having regard to all of the features of the case I am not persuaded that it was beyond the range of the discretion of such an experienced sentencing judge.

1JOHNSON J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2PRICE J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  Mr Ishak Daeng Taru Ali (the surname is Taru Ali) pleaded not guilty to a charge of ""aggravated people smuggling"" contrary to s 233C of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).  The maximum penalty prescribed for such an offence is imprisonment for 20 years or a fine of 2,000 penalty units, or both.  The charge was described in the indictment as follows:
Between about 31 August 2010 and about 6 September 2010 in the seas between the Republic of Indonesia and the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Australia, facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia of a group of at least five persons, namely a group of fifty-two (52) persons, who were non-citizens and who had no lawful right to come to Australia, and he did so reckless as to whether the said fifty-two (52) persons had a lawful right to come to Australia.
4A trial before her Honour Judge Woodburne SC and a jury of twelve commenced on 6 February 2012 and concluded with a verdict of guilty being returned on 28 February 2012.  On 29 February 2012, the learned judge sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years (the minimum required by s 236B of the Migration Act).
5The appellant appeals only against his conviction and upon the sole ground that:
The trial judge erred in her directions to the jury in that the direction to the jury as to the accused's knowledge as to the ultimate destination was not sufficient.
Facts
6On 6 September 2010, the Royal Australian Navy (""the Navy"") detected and intercepted a vessel about six nautical miles off Ashmore Reef.  Its course was bearing directly towards the Reef.  Ashmore Reef is 80 nautical miles from Rote Island, an island of Indonesia just off West Timor, and 180 nautical miles from the Australian mainland.  There were 56 persons on board (52 passengers and 4 crew).  The appellant was steering the vessel. The passengers and crew were transported to Christmas Island for processing.
7Six of the passengers gave evidence for the prosecution.  In summary, their evidence was that the passengers had departed at night from near Surabaya on the island of Java.  They were launched on two small boats but soon transferred onto the vessel that was to take them to Australia.  There were six crew already on that vessel; a man named Mohamed was in charge. It was a wooden fishing vessel with a cabin, toilet and kitchen upstairs and only the engines down below.
8The passengers were required to remain downstairs although one, Fida Hussain, spent time up in the cabin.  There was a compass, set of maps and GPS device in the cabin. 
9After about six days, when the vessel was near Rote Island, a boat came and collected Mohamed and another member of the crew.  Mohamed took the GPS device with him and the maps were thrown overboard. Thereafter it was the appellant who was responsible for steering.
10From this point the passengers were freer to come up onto the deck.  It was the Crown case that this was because they had passed Rote Island, the southernmost part of Indonesia.
11Twelve hours later the Navy arrived and someone (not the appellant) yelled out, ""Australia police"".  Money was collected from the passengers both before and after the Navy arrived and given to the appellant for getting them to their destination safely.
12One of the passenger witnesses, Hamad Alshammari, gave evidence that the passengers were happy when the naval boat was sighted; they patted the appellant on the back and were saying ""thank you"" in Arabic.  Mr Alshammari showed the appellant photographs of his children.  In response, the appellant made a gesture with his hands with the inside of the wrists together and each hand cupped facing each other.  It was the Crown case that this was a handcuff gesture indicating that the appellant knew that he would be going to gaol.  Mr Alshammari then gave the appellant US$100 as well as money he had collected from other passengers.
13Fida Hussain, another one of the passenger witnesses, gave evidence about items in the cabin, including maps.  Mr Hussain took an interest in being told where they were and where they were going.  The maps showed various Indonesian islands and a location called Pulau Pasir (the Indonesian name for Ashmore Reef).  He said the crew told him that when they arrived in Australian waters there would be Ashmore Reef and that the Australian Navy will come and collect them. He said that these conversations were with all of the crew members. (AB2 161-2)
14Mr Hussain recalled speaking with the appellant about when they would get to Australian waters.  The appellant sometimes said ""two days"" and at other times ""three days"". (AB2 164)
15The appellant had a mobile phone and he was sending and receiving text messages.  He spoke to Mr Hussain about one of the messages and said ""the police will come from this side so we have to change our direction, we have to go from the other side of sea"".  (AB2 166)
16Mr Hussain was asked about other conversations he had with the appellant and he replied: 
Nothing much.  It was just try to keep us calm down and it was give us hope, so said you'll be fine and safe and I try to, we try get you there safe.
Q.  When he said ""get you there safe"", was there or was there not ever any specific mention of the destination of the boat?A. INTERPRETER: Yeah, of course, he was saying Pulau Pasir. (AB2 166)
17Mr Hussain said he overheard conversations between the appellant and other crew about their destination.  These conversations included reference to a plan that when they arrived in Australian waters and were questioned by the Navy, they would say, ""we've been forced to come here"".  The appellant and another crew member had said this.  He said the appellant had told him that ""when the Australian Navy came and they will put us in jail and you guys will be free"".  (AB2 167)
18Mr Hussain said that it was Mohamad and the appellant who told the passengers to stay below deck during the day.  The effect of his evidence was that this was explained as being necessary because there would be other vessels about and suspicion would be aroused if a large number of Middle-Eastern people were seen on a fishing vessel. (AB2 168)
19The appellant was promised a payment of US$100 as ""a gift"" if he were to get the passengers ""safe and sound to Australian water"".  When the Navy boat came, Mr Hussain had forgotten his promise; the appellant reminded him; and Mr Hussain apologised and gave him the money. (AB2 170-171)
20The appellant's evidence was that he had been hired to steer the boat on a voyage to Bali as the passengers were going on a holiday. He did not know the boat was travelling to Australia; he did not know that Ashmore Reef was part of Australia; and he did not intend to take the passengers to Australia.  He denied talking to any passengers; looking at maps; having a mobile phone; or telling the passengers to stay below deck.  He received some money from Mr Alshammari but he did not know why.  He did not make any ""handcuff"" gesture.
Elements of the offence
21The wording of the charge in the indictment mirrored the terms of s 233C(1):
(1)  A person (the first person) commits an offence if:(a)  the first person organises or facilitates the bringing or coming to Australia, or the entry or proposed entry into Australia, of a group of at least 5 persons (the other persons); and(b)  at least 5 of the other persons are non-citizens; and(c)  the persons referred to in paragraph (b) who are non-citizens had, or have, no lawful right to come to Australia.Penalty:  Imprisonment for 20 years or 2,000 penalty units, or both.
22Subsection (2) provides that absolute liability applies to paragraph (1)(b).  Subsection (3) provides for an alternative verdict for the basic offence of people smuggling in s 233A if the trier of fact is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the circumstance of aggravation in s 233C (""at least 5 persons"").
23The provision that ""absolute liability applies to paragraph (1)(b)"" means that the prosecution simply had to establish that ""at least 5 of the other persons are non-citizens"".  There is no fault element and no availability of a defence of mistake of fact.
24Subsection (1)(c) is a physical element; it is a ""circumstance in which conduct occurs"": s 4.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (""the Code"").  No fault element for subsection (1)(c) is provided in s 233C.   Accordingly, and by default, the fault element is recklessness: s 5.6(2) of the Code. 
25The question in the present case involves the construction of subsection (1)(a).  It is also a physical element of the offence.  It involves ""conduct"": s 4.1(1)(a) of the Code.  As no fault element is provided for it in s 233C, the default fault element of intention in s 5.6(1) applies.  Intention is established by proof that a person meant to engage in the conduct in question:  s 5.2(1) of the Code.
26The elements of the offence were set out in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Northern Territory in The Queen v Ahmad [2012] NTCCA 1; (2012) 256 FLR 423. That was a case concerned with the predecessor of s 233C, namely s 232A of the Migration Act, but there is no relevant difference between the two provisions. 
27In Ahmad, a stay of proceedings had been granted by the trial judge on the basis that the prosecution could not prove what she considered to be an essential element of the offence.  The facts of the case included that the respondent said and did things to indicate that he understood that the boat upon which he was either the master or a crew member was destined for Australia.  The trial judge thought that it was fatal to the prosecution that it could not establish that the relevant persons had actually entered Australia; the boat had been intercepted before it did so. It was held in the Court of Criminal Appeal (Mildren J at [17]-[19]; Southwood and Martin JJ at [40], [46]), in effect, that s 232A was intended to have territorial effect beyond Australia's boundaries and that proof that the people concerned entered Australia was not required.  Southwood and Martin JJ set out the elements of the offence (at [47]) which, deleting reference to the facts of that case, were:
1. The accused facilitated the bringing to Australia of a group of five or more passengers.
2.   The accused meant to facilitate the bringing of the passengers to Australia.
3.   At least five of the passengers were people to whom s 42(1) of the Migration Act applies.  That is, the passengers were not Australian citizens; and at the relevant time they did not have valid visas permitting them to enter Australia.
4.   The accused was reckless as to whether the passengers had a lawful right to come to Australia.
28I respectfully agree with that distillation of the elements of the offence. 
The appeal
29The ground of appeal is concerned with the first and second elements.  The trial judge combined them into the one element and directed the jury as to the fault element (element 2 above) that:
The Crown must establish not only that the accused physically facilitated the voyage to Australia but that he did so with the knowledge that what he was doing was assisting in bringing the group of at least five persons to Australia.  That is he must have acted intentionally.
In order to act intentionally the accused must have meant to do what he did.  In this case the accused meant to do what he did if he knew that by steering the boat and taking the group to the place that he did he was helping to take the group to Australia. (AB1 6-7)
30The contention of counsel for the appellant on the appeal is encapsulated in a single paragraph of his written submissions:
It is submitted that the trial judge's direction to the jury was not sufficient.  Given the evidence in this case and the reference by the passenger witness Fida Hussain to the use of the words ""Ashmore Reef/Island"" or in the context of what the appellant was said to have stated the use of the words ""Palau Pasir""[sic - Pulau Pasir is Indonesian for Ashmore Reef], the direction in this case needed to address the issue of the appellant having knowledge that Ashmore Reef/Island or [Pulau] Pasir [was] part of Australia. (AWS [29])
31Reliance was placed upon a number of appellate decisions which post-dated the appellant's trial: PJ v The Queen [2012] VSCA 146; 268 FLR 99; Sunada v R; Jaru v R [2012] NSWCCA 187; and Alomalu v R [2012] NSWCCA 255.
32PJ v The Queen was an appeal against an interlocutory judgment concerned with the construction of the phrase ""facilitate the bringing or coming to Australia of a group of at least five persons"" in s 233C(1)(a) of the Migration Act.  The Crown had contended before the trial judge that it was sufficient if it were established that the intended destination, Christmas Island, was a place within Australian territory, whether or not the accused was aware that Christmas Island was part of Australia.  The defence had contended that it was a necessary element of proof that the prosecution establish that the applicant was aware that the destination of the journey that he was alleged to have facilitated was Australia. The trial judge upheld the Crown's submission and the accused sought leave to appeal. 
33The Victorian Court of Appeal (Maxwell P, Redlich and Hansen JJA) held (at [5]; 101):
For the applicant to be found guilty of the offence under s 233C he must be shown to have intended that the relevant persons be brought to Australia.  That is, he must have been aware that Australia was the intended destination.
34Given that it was an appeal against an interlocutory judgment given at a pre-trial hearing, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was confined to the statutory construction point without any consideration of the factual issues in the case itself.  
35Having regard to the provisions of s 233C as a whole, I consider that the above statement by the Court of Appeal should be understood as if the words ""of the relevant persons"" were added to the end of the second sentence.  It is the destination of those persons, rather than the destination of a particular step in their journey, that is what the provision is concerned with.
36Sunada v R; Jaru v R was an ex tempore judgment of this Court (Macfarlan JA, Price and McCallum JJ) given two months after PJ v The Queen was handed down.  It was concerned with the now-repealed s 232A(1) of the Migration Act. That provision was in the following terms:
(1) A person who:(a) organises or facilitates the bringing or coming to Australia, or the entry or proposed entry into Australia, of a group of 5 or more people to whom subsection 42(1) applies; and (b) does so reckless as to whether the people had, or have, a lawful right to come to Australia;is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction, by imprisonment for 20 years or 2,000 penalty units, or both.
37The trial judge directed the jury:
It is enough if the Crown can prove that the accused knew that they were coming to Ashmore Reef, however called.  The Crown does not have to prove that they knew that it was part of Australia.
38It was submitted that this direction was erroneous but the trial judge declined to redirect the jury.  The appellants were found guilty and appealed against their convictions.  On the appeal, the Court's attention was invited to PJ v The Queen.  The Crown accepted the correctness of that authority; conceded that the trial judge's direction was erroneous; and submitted that the convictions should be quashed.  The Court accepted those concessions and upheld the appeal.  There was no occasion to discuss the evidence in the trial or the factual or legal issues that arose.
39In Alomalu the appellant was a member of the crew of a boat that conveyed asylum seekers from Indonesia to Ashmore Reef.  He submitted that his conviction for aggravated people smuggling (s 233C) was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence on the basis that the Crown had failed to prove to the requisite standard that he knew that the boat was destined for Australia; and, even if he did know that it was destined for Ashmore Reef, he did not know that Ashmore Reef was part of Australia.
40McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Rothman and Adamson JJ agreed, reviewed the evidence in the trial and said (at [37]) that ""the most that can be established from the evidence is that the appellant was told that the passengers would be taken to Ashmore Reef.  As was conceded by the Crown, there is no evidence to establish that the appellant knew that Ashmore Reef was a part of Australia.""  His Honour continued (at [38]):
In the last decade the arrival to Australia of asylum seekers via boat from Indonesia is an issue that has received considerable focus in the Australian media. As a result, many Australians would be aware of the location of Ashmore Reef, know that it is part of Australia and be conscious of its significance as a port of entry for asylum seekers. Many Australians would readily infer that a boat that departs from a port in Indonesia with 78 passengers from Middle Eastern nations and charts a course in a southerly direction is likely to have a final destination of Australia. However, it is a different matter for a poor, itinerate worker from Indonesia. Knowledge that an Australian would have cannot be attributed without evidence to an Indonesian. The inevitable outcome is that I have a doubt about whether the appellant knew that he was facilitating the bringing of persons to Australia and that is a doubt that the jury should have had. The issue is not capable of being resolved adversely to the appellant by any advantage which the jury may have had. It follows that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.
41Another ground of appeal in Alomalu was to the effect that the trial judge had erred in failing to direct the jury that they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended that the five or more persons be brought to a destination that was a part of Australia and that the accused knew that the destination was a part of Australia.  The trial judge had directed the jury that the accused intended to do something if he meant to do it and:
In this case, the accused meant to do it if the accused knew he was helping to take people to Australia. (Alomalu at [70]).
42McClellan CJ at CL held (at [82]):
To my mind his Honour's direction was not sufficient to effectively isolate the issue that the jury had to determine. It is the source of the problem identified in Ground 3 [the unreasonable verdict ground]. Although it was correct to instruct the jury that they must be satisfied that the appellant knew that he was helping to take people to Australia, the issue in this case was whether, although he knew the boat was going to Ashmore Reef, he knew that Ashmore Reef was a part of Australia. The emphasis in both Sunada and PJ was on the accused knowing that the intended destination of the voyage was a place known to the accused as Australia. His Honour's direction did not achieve that objective. If I was not of the opinion that the appeal should otherwise be upheld I would have granted leave under Rule 4 and allowed this ground of appeal. (Emphasis added)
43The Crown, rightly in my view, pointed to a discrepancy between what was actually said in PJ v The Queen and what this Court has said about it in the two subsequent cases.
44The passage I set out above from the judgment in PJ v The Queen speaks of an intention that ""the relevant persons be brought to Australia"" and that the accused be aware ""that Australia was the intended destination"".   But in Sunada, this Court referred (at [5]) to it having been held in PJ v The Queen that ""relevant persons brought to a destination that was a part of Australia and that the accused knew was a part of Australia"".  The slight misstatement of what was said in PJ v The Queen is liable to focus attention on the actual destination of the voyage and give it an emphasis that in some cases is unnecessary.  In some cases, such as the present on the Crown submission, the actual destination of the journey was not a critical matter.
45In Alomalu, McClellan CJ at CL referred to Sunada v R; Jaru v R (at [72]) and PJ v The Queen (at [73]).  Later, when identifying the inadequacy of the trial judge's directions because of the factual contest in the case at hand, his Honour said (at [82]):
The emphasis in both Sunada and PJ was on the accused knowing that the intended destination of the voyage was a place known to the accused as Australia.
46I respectfully accept the correctness of what his Honour said.  But it must be understood as a necessary consideration in the factual circumstances of that case (and of Sunada).  
47The rationale for the decision in Alomalu in respect of both grounds turned on the factual issue in the case: that the evidence was capable of establishing that the appellant knew the destination was Ashmore Reef but there was a question as to whether he knew that Ashmore Reef was a part of Australia.  It is pertinent that there was no evidence to establish anything other than the appellant's awareness of the destination being Ashmore Reef.  What the Crown needed to prove was that the appellant meant to facilitate the bringing (etcetera) of people to Australia.  If the appellant's awareness of the destination was not that it was ""Ashmore Reef"" but ""Australia"", the case would undoubtedly have had a different outcome.  The direction given by the trial judge was correct, as noted in the emphasised words in the extract from the judgment above (at [41] and [42]) and no more would have been required.
48The submissions for the Crown on this appeal were to the effect that the appellant's argument is based upon an incorrect understanding of the law.  Putting the argument briefly, it is not the law that a person must know of a destination within Australia to be guilty of people smuggling or aggravated people smuggling offences.  The statutory provisions are only concerned with people who facilitate the bringing or coming of unlawful non-citizens to Australia.  Simply because there is mention of a particular destination does not create an additional element of the offence, or necessarily require directions beyond those that were given in the present case.  
The relevant issue at trial
49The Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury on a number of aspects of its case in support of the proposition that the appellant knew that the boat was destined for Australian waters.  The points he sought to make included the following:
The appellant played a substantial role in controlling the direction of the boat.  He must have known where it was going.  (AB2 497; 500) The conditions under which the passengers were housed must have made it obvious that this was ""no tourist boat"" or ""pleasure cruise"".  (AB2 498; 500)
The appellant was seen by one passenger witness looking at a map.  He was asked by another passenger witness where the boat was going and he pointed to Ashmore Reef, or Pulau Pasir.  (AB2 501)
The appellant was asked on multiple occasions about when they were going to reach Australian waters and was responsive to these questions.  (AB2 503)
The appellant, and other crew members, told passengers that when they arrived in Australian waters, at Ashmore Reef, the Australian Navy would come and collect them.  (AB2 503)
The appellant spoke about text messages on his mobile phone and spoke of the police coming from a particular direction and that they would need to change their course.  This showed a knowledge of the illegality of the voyage.  (AB2 504)
The appellant told a passenger that when the Australian Navy arrived, the crew would be put in gaol and the passengers would be free.  (AB2 504)
The appellant was overheard speaking with another crew member about being apprehended by the Australian Navy and saying that they had been forced to go on the journey.  (AB2 504)
When the boat was intercepted by the Navy, the appellant reminded a passenger of his earlier promise to pay US$100 if the boat arrived at its destination safely.  (AB2 511)
The appellant made a gesture with his hands as if in handcuffs, demonstrating knowledge that the voyage was illegal and that he would be going to gaol.  (AB2 511)
When it was intercepted, the boat was on a direct course for Ashmore Reef and the appellant was steering.  This also supported the proposition that he knew where it was going.  (AB2 512)
50The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the jury would have ""no reasonable doubt that the [appellant] knew that the destination of the boat was Australia"". (AB2 514)
51The foregoing demonstrates that the Crown case as to the first two elements of the offence was squarely focussed on the question of whether the appellant was aware that he was facilitating the bringing or coming of a group of at least five persons ""to Australia"".
52The appellant's evidence included that he had never heard of Australia or of Ashmore Reef (AB2 376; 385).  He did not know where Australia was (AB2 397). He had heard of a place called Pulau Pasir but he did not know where it was (AB2 385-6).   When he embarked upon the voyage he thought he was being paid to steer a boat to Bali (AB2 393).   After the boat had passed Bali he had no idea where the boat was going (AB2 394).  After the two principals disembarked at Rote Island, he was told to maintain a southerly course but still did not know where they were going (AB2 395-7).   He denied certain aspects of the prosecution case such as being involved in conversations that the Crown said demonstrated his knowledge and intention.
53Counsel who appeared for the appellant at trial, but not on the appeal, submitted to the judge that she should direct the jury along the lines suggested in the ground of appeal.  Her Honour responded to the effect that whilst such a direction might be appropriate in a particular case, the issue with which such a direction is concerned did not arise in this case.
54Counsel's response included, ""I agree your Honour that on the facts of this case that's a long shot.""  Nevertheless, counsel maintained that such a direction should be given.  The jury might reject the [appellant's] denials but conclude that because there was reference to Ashmore Reef, that he was only aware of this as the place he was taking the passengers to and was not aware it was part of Australia.
Submissions and determination
55Reference to Ashmore Reef in the evidence did not convert the defence case to something beyond what the appellant had said in his evidence or make a question of whether he knew Ashmore Reef was part of Australia an issue in the trial.
56It was put to counsel for the appellant at the hearing of the appeal that there appeared to be two cases presented to the jury:  the Crown case being one which sought to demonstrate the accused's knowledge and intention about the boat going to Australia; and the defence case being the exact opposite, that the appellant had no knowledge of the destination at all, let alone an intention to facilitate the passage of persons to Australia.  Counsel was asked to identify how the jury could possibly have taken a middle course of deciding that the appellant was aware that the boat was going to Ashmore Reef but did not know that it was part of Australia.  Counsel responded by inviting the Court's attention to certain passages in the evidence of the prosecution witness, Fida Hussain.
57Mr Hussain said he saw in the captain's cabin a map, a GPS, a compass and some tools to fix the engine.  He was asked about the map:
Q. What did you see depicted on the map?A. INTERPRETER: On the map it was drawn like places, like islands, mainly Indonesian.  Also it was point which way in which direction we're going and up to Ashmore Reef or Pulau Pasir and I saw Ashmore.  They had the map, I could see. 
...
Q. You mentioned another place that sounded something like Pulau Pasir, is that correct?A. INTERPRETER:  Because he was talking in his language like he was mentioning that name Pulau Pasir and I wasn't quite sure what that means and he was just pointing at the Ashmore Reef island and he was saying the Navy will come and collect you guys from there.
Q. Why were you talking in particular about Ashmore Reef?A. INTERPRETER:  The crew, actually they were telling me or telling us so when you get to Australia water so there will be Ashmore Reef and Australian Navy will come and collect you guys.
Q. When you say ""the crew"" are you able to identify who exactly within the crew said that to you?A.  INTERPRETER:  All of them.  When we are asking questions they were all answering the same answer, so all of them. (T161-162).
58A little later, the witness spoke of the appellant receiving SMS messages on his mobile phone:
Q. Did you have any further conversation with him in relation to those messages?A. INTERPRETER:  Nothing much. It was just try to keep us calm down and it was give us hope, so said you'll be fine and safe and I try to, we try get you there safe.
Q. When he said ""get you there safe"", was there or was there not ever any specific mention of the destination of the boar?A.  INTERPRETER:  Yeah, of course, he was saying Pulau Pasir.
...
Q.  Did you have any other conversations with the accused, other than simply looking at the map or so on, that were relevant to the fact of your ultimate destination?A.  INTERPRETER:  No, not really but it's just like I was, they, just myself and every other passengers keep asking how long, how long is the journey is, how many days and when we getting to get to Australia's waters. (T166)
59The witness was then asked about conversations he may have overheard between the appellant and other crew members about where the boat was going:
A. INTERPRETER:  Yeah. I heard conversation between him and Ahmad and the other guy, the older guy, and when they were talking about, where you want me to say about what?  I heard a lot of conversations.
Q. In particular about when the boat reached its destination?A.  INTERPRETER:  They were talking about, they have conversation about when we get to Australia's water and when the navy ask us, asked us we will tell them look, we've been forced to come here.
Q.  Who used those words? A. INTERPRETER:  The person who's here and also the older guy.
Q.  Are those the exact words that were used?A.  INTERPRETER:  Yeah, I really can't remember, it was a long time ago, exactly sentence by sentence, but that was the conversation I heard, we will tell the Australian Navy we've been forced to come here.
Q.  And did you personally have any conversation with the accused about what would happen if and when the Australian Navy arrived?A. INTERPETER:  Yes, he told me when the Australian Navy came and they will put us in jail and you guys will be free. (T 167)
60I am unable to discern from this evidence that the jury could have concluded that the appellant knew that the boat was going to Ashmore Reef and that there was, as a result, a question as to whether he knew that Ashmore Reef was a part of Australia.  The evidence set out above certainly contains reference to Ashmore Reef, but it was in the context of conversations about it being in Australian waters, and of the boat being intercepted by the Royal Australian Navy.
61This evidence, and the other items of circumstantial evidence relied upon by the Crown at trial, makes it clear that the question for the jury was whether the appellant knew that the boat was destined for Australia.  This was not a case, as Alomalu was, where ""the most that can be established from the evidence is that the appellant was told that the passengers would be taken to Ashmore Reef"":  Alomalu at [37].

62Put succinctly, the submissions for the Crown were that the trial judge correctly directed the jury as to the elements of the offence and that, on the facts of this case, no further directions were required.  Those submissions should be accepted.  The appeal should be dismissed.
Order
63I propose the following order:
Appeal against conviction dismissed.

		09 September 2013",2013-09-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706227,Environment Protection Authority v Truegain Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCCA 204,"JUDGMENT


	
	LEEMING JA: The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) seeks leave to appeal, pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, in respect of three interlocutory decisions made by Lloyd AJ on 16 March, 20 March and 18 April 2012. No application appears to have been made for certification that the judgments were proper ones for determination on appeal (cf s 5F(3)(b)), and so leave is required. It seems that no orders were made until the third decision, so that no extension of time is required pursuant to r 5B of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952. The Court was told that no further steps have been taken in the prosecution since April 2012.
	
	
	The principal submission made by the EPA, by grounds 1-10 of its application for leave to appeal, is that the primary judge erred in determining that the summons filed in Class 5 of the jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court suffered from duplicity. (The EPA’s written and oral submissions did not address individual grounds, and these reasons follow the same course.) The EPA also challenges an order of costs against it.
	
	
	In my opinion, the EPA’s summons was duplicitous, substantially for the reasons given by the primary judge. However, I respectfully disagree that s 68 of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979 (LEC Act) authorised the ordering of costs in that Court’s summary jurisdiction, prior to the determination of the prosecution. In my opinion, there should be a grant of leave, the costs order should be set aside, but the appeal otherwise dismissed.
	


The commencement of the prosecution


	
	The EPA claimed by its summons filed 3 June 2011 that the respondent (Truegain) had committed an offence against s 64(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (POEO Act), which is in these terms:
	


“If any condition of a licence is contravened by any person, each holder of the licence is guilty of an offence.

Maximum penalty:

(a)   in the case of a corporation - $1,000,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further penalty of $120,000 for each day the offence continues, or

(b)   in the case of an individual - $250,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further penalty of $60,000 for each day the offence continues.”


	
	It was common ground that Truegain was the holder of Environment Protection Licence 7638 (Licence) which authorised the carrying out of “scheduled activities” at premises occupied by it at Rutherford. The relevant scheduled activity authorised was “Waste processing (non-thermal treatment)”. Section 48(2) of the POEO Act makes it an offence to carry on a scheduled activity without holding a licence which authorises that activity. Scheduled activities are listed in Schedule 1, within which clause 41 is headed “Waste processing (non-thermal treatment)”; it will be necessary to return to the detail of that clause below.
	
	
	The summons alleged that Truegain was the holder of a licence, a condition of which was contravened by a person “between about 2 June 2010 and about 9 July 2010”. The condition said to have been contravened was condition O1.1, which was in these terms:
	


“Licensed activities must be carried out in a competent manner. This includes:

(a)   the processing, handling, movement and storage of materials and substances used to carry out the activity; and

(b)   the treatment, storage, processing, reprocessing, transport and disposal of waste generated by the activity.”


	
	The summons alleged that Truegain failed to carry out its licensed activities in a competent manner in that:
	


“[I]t failed to have appropriate systems in place to treat and/or store liquid wastes at [its] premises in the following ways:

(i)   Causing liquid waste to be treated and/or stored in an inadequately bunded area at the Premises; and/or

(ii)   Causing liquid waste to be treated and/or stored in an inadequately alarmed area at the Premises; and/or

(iii)   Failing to have systems and procedures in place to prevent the escape of liquid waste at the Premises; and/or

(iv)   Failing to adequately treat liquid waste at the Premises; and/or

(v)   Failing to adequately store liquid waste at the Premises; and/or

(vi)   Dealing with liquid waste inappropriately.”


	
	It will be seen that particulars (i) and (ii) involved treatment and storage within the same paragraph, particulars (iv) and (v) although separate paragraphs, were to the same effect, and particulars (iii) and (vi) were capable of extending to both treatment and storage.
	
	
	The summons stated that evidence of the offence first came to the attention of an authorised officer on 6 June 2010. The POEO Act contains its own time limits. It requires prosecutions for an offence under s 64 to be commenced “within but not later than” 12 months after the date on which it is alleged to have been committed: s 216(1). However, s 216(2) authorises the commencement of proceedings for an alleged offence under, inter alia, s 64, “within but not later than” 12 months after the date on which evidence of the offence first came to the attention of any relevant authorised officer. By filing its summons on Friday 3 June 2011, the EPA did not commence its prosecution until the last possible day.
	


The request for and provision of particulars


	
	In the months after its prosecution commenced, the EPA served a prosecution brief comprising some thirty affidavits including from its own officers, Truegain employees, officers from Fire Rescue NSW and a senior planner at Maitland City Council. There ensued a series of correspondence and procedural hearings, directed to obtaining further particulars as to the “manner of breach” set out in the summons. On 19 September 2011 the EPA served an expert report of Mr Wayne Davis, and on 14 December 2011 the EPA supplied a draft “Statement of Agreed Facts” of 254 paragraphs extending over 33 pages identifying what on their face were a series of events in which untreated liquids were discharged into the environment, contrary to the conditions on Truegain’s permit. The EPA contended that those documents amounted to the particulars sought by Truegain.
	
	
	Truegain’s solicitor did not agree. He responded:
	


“[W]e disagree with your view … that the particulars previously requested by us have been answered in the draft Statement. The draft Statement is a voluminous compilation of contentious allegations relating to disparate aspects of our client’s operations, from which we have been unable to distil the particulars of the charge brought against our client.”

Truegain’s motion


	
	By motion dated 20 February 2012, Truegain sought an order that the EPA provide the particulars requested in its letter dated 8 November 2011. Rather than oppose that motion, the EPA supplied particulars by letters dated 24 and 28 February 2012. Those particulars led to Truegain filing an amended motion on 1 March that the proceedings be dismissed or stayed on the basis that the charge was duplicitous.
	
	
	The letters of 24 and 28 February comprised 18 single spaced pages providing further particulars of the “Manner of breach” particulars in the summons. They are not easy to read, and, having regard to the course the prosecution subsequently took, it is not necessary to summarise them completely in these reasons; I merely summarise two, by way of example. The particulars refer to the Trade Waste Tank (TWT) and the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) located on Truegain’s premises.
	
	
	First, the “failure to adequately treat liquid waste at the premises” was said to have taken place at “the area(s) in which the TWT is located” and “the area(s) associated with the WWTP” by processing the contents of the TWT when it contained sewerage, something not permitted under the Licence. It was said that treated water could only be pumped to sewer in accordance with limits set by a separate permit issued by Hunter Water Corporation, and that those limits had been exceeded in the period 2 June to 9 July 2010. It was also said that there had been a failure to report an overflow from the TWT “being an incident causing or threatening material environmental harm to the environment” (thereby picking up the language of s 148 of the POEO Act) and bypassing water and/or flow meters on the TWT so that not all water discharged to the sewer had been recorded. It was further said that there had been a failure to install or maintain a tank farm for the WWTP, a failure to bund the TWT, a failure to utilise the filtration system installed at the WWTP and reprocessing the contents of the TWT through the WWTP and half a dozen other failings. It might be thought that some matters summarised above could not constitute a failure adequately to treat liquid waste; neverthless, those were the particulars provided.
	
	
	Secondly, the further particulars given of “failing to adequately store liquid waste at the premises” stated that the complaint related to the entire premises, that there had been non-compliances with further conditions of the licence, namely O5.1 (which required installing bunding around above ground tanks or else putting in place an alternative spill containment system), O5.2 (which required the licensee to ensure that suitable measures (eg high/low alarms, control valves with interlock control, one way-valves) were installed on all tanks, ponds or clarifiers and associated pipes and hoses to prevent spillage of waste and L1.1 (which required the licensee to comply with s 120 of the POEO Act) and then set out some thirteen requirements (such as ensuring that only properly qualified operators were working on the WWTP, ensuring that bunds at the premises are not used for storage, reinstating the filtration system installed at the WWTP and implementing a system of management for rainwater at the premises). Once again, some of these might be thought not readily to answer the description of inadequately storing liquid waste, but those were the particulars provided.
	
	
	It will be seen immediately that some of the particulars of the contravention were acts in fact undertaken by Truegain and its officers and employees on particular days, or alternatively throughout the period, others (in fact, the majority) were omissions. The acts and omissions related to different parts of the licensed premises. It was also alleged expressly that there were contraventions of other licence conditions (O5.1, O5.2 and L1.1). Condition L1.1 made it a condition of the licence that Truegain comply with s 120 of the POEO Act. Section 120 makes it an offence for a person to pollute any waters; s 122 provides for a defence if the pollution was regulated by an environmental protection licence whose conditions were not contravened, and s 123 imposes a penalty not exceeding $1,000,000 in the case of a corporation.
	


The First reasons


	
	In commendably short submissions four pages long, junior counsel for Truegain identified, by reference to the particulars, seventeen different ways in which the offence was said to have been committed, in twelve different places on Truegain’s premises. The submission identified four conditions of the licence, separate offences of polluting waters in breach of s 120 of the Act, separate offences of carrying out the processing, the movement, the storing, the treatment of waste, the storing of waste, the processing of waste, the reprocessing of waste and the disposal of waste incompetently, and failing itself to comply with the licence in breach of s 64 of the Act, and failing to ensure that persons associated with it complied with the licence in breach of s 64 of the Act. The twelve different places at which the offence was said to have been committed included the TWT, the WWTP, the underground storage tank, various bunds adjacent to the oil/water separator, the tank farms, the sheds and the shipping containers. The submission concluded:
	


“8.   In light of the above, it is apparent that dozens of separate offences have been alleged under a single charge.

9.   Accordingly, the charge is bad for duplicity and the proceedings ought to be dismissed. See Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 482-492; Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Limited [1988] VR 411 and Byrne v Baker [1964] VR 443.”


	
	Central to what was advanced by the EPA in the Court below and in this Court was the submission that:
	


“The proper construction of section 64 of the POEO Act is that it is an offence provision that envisages a single criminal enterprise made up of more than one act. It is not directed at specific and individual acts or omissions but a course of conduct or series of events over time to establish incompetence.”


	
	The EPA stated that in the event that the summons was duplicitous, there was no power to dismiss it but the Court “may, however, cause the indictment to be amended to remove the defect” (paragraph 7). It was also said that:
	


“Section 17 [of the Criminal Procedure Act] provides, inter alia, the discretion of the court to cause the indictment to be amended. Section 20(1)(a) [of the Criminal Procedure Act] provides that such an amendment may be made with the leave of the court, or by order of the court of its own motion.”


	
	In his reasons given on 16 March 2012: [2012] NSWLEC 41 (First reasons) his Honour summarised (at [8]) 17 acts which Truegain had contended amounted to separate offences alleged under a single charge. It is sufficient for the purposes of this appeal to reproduce only some of them below:
	


“(i)   the defendant committed the offence by breaching condition O1.1 of the licence (see particular (b) in the summons);

(ii)   the defendant committed the offence by breaching condition O5.1 of the licence (see, e.g., para. 19 (first bullet point) in the second letter);

(iii)   the defendant committed the offence by breaching condition O5.2 of the licence (see, e.g., para. 19 (second bullet point) in the second letter);

(iv)   the defendant committed the offence by breaching condition L1.1 of the licence (see, e.g., para. 19 (third bullet point) in the second letter);

(v)   the defendant committed the offence by failing, itself, to comply with the licence, in breach of s 64 of the Act (see, e.g., para. 14 in the second letter);

(vi)   the defendant committed the offence by failing to ensure that persons associated with the defendant complied with the licence, in breach of s 64 of the Act (see, e.g., para. 24 (first bullet point) in the second letter);

(vii)   the defendant committed the offence by failing to notify the EPA of a tank overflow in breach of the obligations set out in Part 5.7 of the Act (see, e.g., para. 24 (third bullet point) in the second letter);

(viii)   the defendant committed the offence by polluting waters in breach of s 120 of the Act (see, e.g., para. 24 (top of page 9) in the Second Letter);

(ix)   the defendant committed the offence by carrying out the processing of materials and substances incompetently (see, e.g., para. 10 (penultimate bullet point) in the second letter).”


	
	His Honour said at [9] that:
	


“It can immediately be seen that the prosecutor by its particulars alleges breaches of other conditions of the licence and breaches of other provisions of the Act, all of which are said to amount to a commission of the offence”.


	
	After a helpful and concise analysis of the law, his Honour accepted that the offence created by s 64 could encompass a course of conduct (at [37]). His Honour referred to the penalty provisions which included provision for both a single penalty and a further penalty “in the case of a continuing offence”. His Honour said (at [39]) that:
	


“The real question is whether the particularised conduct - which may be of a continuing nature - describes a series of discrete or separate offences, accepting, however, that a single offence may be of a continuing nature.”


	
	His Honour concluded that there was actual duplicity, by the allegations of contravention of more than one licence condition, whereas the offence created by s 64 was committed if any one condition was breached (at [46]). His Honour also held that the acts or omissions said to contravene other statutory provisions ((ii)-(iv) and (vii)-(viii)) were duplicitous for the same reason (at [48]). His Honour held that with the possible exception of (v) and (vi), the balance was also duplicitous. He said (at [49]) (emphasis in original):
	


“As Dixon J said in Johnson v Miller: ‘Prima facie, but one offence can be proved under one charge’ and ‘to admit evidence of thirty distinct offences would be contrary to law’. In the present case, as in Byrne v Baker, as in Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd and as in Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill the summons charges the defendant with a single offence but each of the particulars if proved would constitute an offence. Thus, as in Boral Gas, the particulars allege a number of separate and distinct failures each of which would be a contravention in itself. If, however, the same act or omission were alleged then only one offence would be involved, but that is not the case here. To adopt Hill J in Boral Gas (at 179):

‘Many of the acts and/or omissions identified as failures are disparate in nature and content. They involve different items of plant, different systems of work, different operations and procedures … The defence, if any, under s 53 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act may well be very different in respect of each alleged failure.’”


	
	Finally, his Honour concluded (at [51]) that any defence Truegain might have might well be different in respect of each of the various failures particularised. His Honour held that the summons as amplified by the particulars was duplicitous, although not incurably bad. He said that the prosecutor could elect, prior to trial, which of the matters alleged in the particulars it proposed to pursue.
	


Further particulars and the Second reasons


	
	Thereafter, the EPA provided three pages described as “particulars to amended summons” which were confined to the “failure to adequately store liquid waste at the Premises” and the “failure to adequately treat liquid waste at the Premises”. Although it is long, it represents the ultimate way in which the EPA, after a hearing on duplicity and with the benefit of the reasons of the primary judge, proposed to advance its prosecution for a single charge of a serious environmental offence, and is set out in full in an annexure to these reasons.
	
	
	It will be seen that the EPA, in elaborate detail, identified both storage and treatment separately within the single charge, and particularised different acts and omissions on different days in respect of different areas of the premises so as to make good the allegations of inadequate storage and treatment.
	
	
	The matter returned to the primary judge on 20 March 2012, when Truegain maintained that the amended particulars continued to disclose duplicity. Despite the way in which the amended particulars were drafted, distinguishing storage from treatment, the EPA submitted that the storage of materials on site was part of the treatment of waste received, when decanting was occurring. When pressed in relation to the proposition that there were times when liquids were being stored with nothing happening to them, the EPA’s response was one which, in my opinion, illustrated the underlying problem (Transcript 20.03.12, 10.46-48, emphasis added):
	


“Even if [storage and treatment] are separate activities in my submission that doesn’t mean it would fall foul of duplicity, because the offence provision requires the prosecutor to establish that one of the conditions has been breached.”


	
	His Honour dealt with the dispute immediately (Second reasons) and said ([2012] NSWLEC 55 at [5]-[9]):
	


“A failure to treat adequately and a failure to store adequately gives rise, in my opinion, to separate or discrete omissions each of which, if established, gives rise to an offence.

To repeat what I said in my previous judgment, ‘only one offence can be proved under one charge’, as Dixon J said in Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 487. Moreover, as Dixon J also said at 489:

‘... evidence of more than one offence cannot be admitted, and under one charge to take evidence of a number of separate instances of the commission of the same offence ... is to pursue a course contrary to law.’

In the present case each of the particulars (c)(iv) and (v) in the summons would constitute an offence. The case is indistinguishable from Byrne v Baker [1964] VR 443, Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd [1988] VR 411 and Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill (1995) 37 NSWLR 150 where in those cases the legislation is in material respects similar to that with which we are concerned here.

As in those cases, the particulars now furnished in the present case allege separate and distinct failures each of which would be a contravention of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. As Hill J said in Boral Gas at 179:

‘In my view, these alleged failures involve at least two alleged contraventions ... and therefore two offences. The nature and content of each failure is separate and distinct.’

The prosecutor must therefore elect as to which of the two particulars it has now identified it wishes to pursue.”

The Third reasons


	
	Finally, by a reserved judgment (Third reasons) following a hearing on 21 March 2012, the primary judge required the prosecutor to amend its summons by deleting the particulars on which it would no longer rely, and pay the defendant’s costs thrown away by the reason of the amendment, such costs including the costs of the motions already determined and referred to above: [2012] NSWLEC 78 at [11]-[12].
	


“It can be seen from this sorry recital of the essential facts that the prosecutor has been persistently in breach of the Court's directions and declined on no less than five occasions to provide the particulars sought by the defendant. It was, frankly, ridiculous to expect the defendant to distill the prosecutor's case from 22 lever-arch files of evidence which had been served and from a draft statement of facts comprising 254 paragraphs (which was itself served by the prosecutor more than three weeks late). The defendant's initial request for particulars was reasonable and, when the particulars were ultimately and somewhat reluctantly supplied, it was necessary for the Court to go to those particulars in order to understand whether the summons as particularised was duplicitous.

The prosecutor's conduct of the prosecution is deserving of the severest censure and necessitated a large number of otherwise unnecessary pre-trial appearances, culminating in the defendant's notice of motion of 20 February (amended on 1 March) and the subsequent hearing before me.”


	
	His Honour held that s 68 of the LEC Act was a source of power to make an order for costs. His Honour found that s 257C of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 did not exclude the operation of s 68, which applied in proceedings in the Court’s Class 5 (criminal) jurisdiction: at [18]. His Honour referred to Wakool Shire Council v Garrision Cattle Feeders Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 199; (2010) 177 LGERA 282, where a prosecutor’s summons was found to be bad for duplicity, and the prosecutor was ordered to pay the defendant’s costs, although there was no reference to s 68 in that decision: at [19]. His Honour found that it was not necessary to find that exceptional circumstances relating to the conduct of the proceedings existed before costs could be awarded, in contrast with s 257D of the Criminal Procedure Act: at [22]. However if s 257D were to apply, then his Honour found that it was just and reasonable to order the EPA to pay Truegain’s costs: at [25].
	


Duplicity

(a) Introduction


	
	Archbold states (Archbold, Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice (2013) Sweet & Maxwell) at [1-216] that:
	


“The general principle in respect of what has come to be known as the rule against duplicity is that the indictment must not be double; that is to say, no one count of the indictment should charge the defendant with having committed two or more separate offences.”


	
	That passage (from an earlier edition of Archbold) was cited by Toohey J in S v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 266 at 280-281 and by Adamson J (with the agreement of Hoeben CJ at CL and Davies J) in Chapman v R [2013] NSWCCA 91 at [19].
	
	
	In Rixon v Thompson [2009] VSCA 84; (2009) 22 VR 323 at [46], Maxwell P, Weinberg JA and Kyrou AJA said that:
	


“It is a basic rule of the common law that no count in an indictment should charge the defendant with having committed two or more separate offences.”


	
	That “basic rule” is sufficient for the purpose of resolving this appeal. It finds support in Walsh v Tattersall (1996) 188 CLR 77 at 104 (Kirby J); S v The Queen at 280-281 (Toohey J); R v WWS [2009] VSCA 125; (2009) 22 VR 559 at [14], and in many other decisions, including R v Abdollahi (No 12) [2013] NSWSC 485 at [8].
	
	
	As noted above, the EPA’s response was, in essence, to contend that there was but one offence charged, to which all of the factual matters particularised contributed. It was not suggested by the EPA that the basis of Truegain’s complaint was not available. But, notwithstanding the agreement of the parties, it is necessary to say something of the background to the principle on which Truegain relied, in order to bring to account three considerations relevant to the disposition of this appeal. The first is that it will be seen that the rule relating to duplicity is a product of judge-made law and statute law, and it is necessary to bear in mind the statutory influences in order to determine its scope and content. The second is that the vices to which the rule is addressed emerge from earlier decisions, such that it will be seen that what the EPA seeks to achieve, and which the primary judge, in my opinion rightly, found could not be achieved, was contrary to a central element of the rule. The third is that one of the statutory provisions long ago enacted to ameliorate the nineteenth century excesses of the principle is relevant to the final grounds of the appeal (relating to the power to order costs).
	


(b) Historical background


	
	In S v The Queen, Gaudron and McHugh JJ at 284 traced the rule against duplicity to the seventeenth century, described by Kirby J as a time when there was “severe technicality and precision with respect to pleadings generally”: Walsh v Tattersall at 105. The rule was originally formulated with reference to indictments, but it was part of the suite of ways in which the Court of King’s Bench, by the middle of the nineteenth century, quashed by certiorari convictions in the exercise of summary jurisdiction, in the manner summarised by Jordan CJ in Ex parte Lovell; Re Buckley (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 153 at 165-167, who concluded that:
	


“[L]arge numbers of delinquents escaped punishment upon grounds some of which were highly technical. Legislation which had the effect of rendering summary convictions less open to attack was passed in England in the nineteenth century.”


	
	The legislation to which Sir Frederick Jordan referred was one of Sir John Jervis’ Acts, the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1848 (11 and 12 Vic c 43), adopted in 1850 in New South Wales (by Act 14 Vic No 43) as well as in other Australian colonies. Thereafter the question arose whether duplicity continued to be available as a basis for attack upon complaints or other originating process in the exercise of summary jurisdiction. The position was described by Griffith CJ in Hedberg v Woodhall (1913) 15 CLR 531 at 534-535 in respect of the Tasmanian legislation:
	


“Up to the end of the first half of last century innumerable objections could be taken in cases before magistrates. Then came the Acts called Jervis's Acts, which did away with many of them. One of those Acts, 11 & 12 Vict. c. 43, which was adopted in Tasmania by 19 Vict. No. 8, provides (sec. 1) that no objection shall be taken or allowed to any information for any alleged defect therein in substance or in form. That apparently means that if objections are taken which really do not go to the merits of the case the magistrate is not to stay his hand, but to proceed to dispose of the case on the merits. A later section (sec. 10) provides that a complaint must be for one matter only, and not for two or more. It was held by the Court of Queen's Bench in the case of Rodgers v Richards [1892] 1 QB 555, that the joining of two offences in one complaint, although contrary to the Act, is a defect in substance or form within the meaning of sec. 1, and does not justify the magistrate in refusing to give judgment in the case.”

The same approach may be seen in Ex parte Williams (1909) 9 SR (NSW) 140 at 144 per Simpson ACJ (“Assuming, however, [the conviction] is double, this Court could, in fact is bound to, amend”); see also at 145 (Cohen J) and 146-147 (Pring J).


	
	Rodgers v Richards [1892] 1 QB 555 and Hedberg v Woodhall might be considered to be highly technical objections. In Rodgers the defendants were charged with a single offence of unlawful “use” of a place for dog fighting and “did encourage and assist” at the fighting of such dogs. The complaint in Hedberg v Woodhall charged the defendant with having undersized flounders in his “possession” or “control”. Both were cases which called for a less extreme response than dismissal - either the provision of particulars confining the charge, or requiring the prosecutor to elect between the various offences embraced by the charge, or permitting the prosecutor to amend. When, eventually, courts exercising summary jurisdiction became empowered to take any of those three courses, the rule against duplicity became not so much a basis for quashing an originating process (or a conviction based upon it) as a means to identify when one or more of those powers was to be exercised.
	
	
	The New South Wales provisions, formerly found in ss 30 and 65 of the Justices Act 1902, are now found in s 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act which is to be read together with the power to amend in s 21 (noting that “indictment” is defined to include “any other process or document by which criminal proceedings are commenced”: see s 15(2)):
	


“16(2) No objection may be taken, or allowed, to any indictment by which criminal proceedings (including committal proceedings) in the Local Court or for any other offence that is to be dealt with summarily are commenced, or to any warrant issued for the purposes of any such proceedings, on the grounds of:

(a)   any alleged defect in it in substance or in form, or

(b)   any variance between it and the evidence adduced at the proceedings for the offence charged in the indictment or warrant.”

“21(1) If of the opinion that an indictment is defective but, having regard to the merits of the case, can be amended without injustice, the court may make such order for the amendment of the indictment as it thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of the case.

(2) If of the opinion:

(a)   that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or

(b)   that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.

(3)   If of the opinion that the postponement of an accused person’s trial is expedient as a consequence of it having amended an indictment or ordered a separate trial of a count, the court may make such order as appears necessary.”


	
	The course of Australian authority in the century following Hedberg v Woodhall confirms that the doctrine of duplicity continues to apply in the exercise of summary jurisdiction. That was, in my opinion, implicit in what was said by Mahoney JA in De Romanis v Sibraa [1977] 2 NSWLR 264 at 291, and on any view was explicitly held by Gleeson CJ (with the agreement of Priestley and Meagher JJA) in Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656 at 667-671, both cases having referred to the early twentieth century decisions. The legislative history was set out by Mahoney JA in Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill (1993) 32 NSWLR 501 at 515-518, and in J Hunter, “Prosecutors’ Pleadings and the Rule Against Duplicity” (1980) 3 UNSW Law Journal 248. As Basten JA observed in Rockdale Beef Pty Ltd v Industrial Relations Commission of NSW [2007] NSWCA 128; (2007) 165 IR 7 at [122]:
	


“At a time when the trial court lacked an express power to amend an information, there was an important distinction to be drawn between the provision of particulars (which could be ordered) and amendment of the information itself. That distinction is no longer of importance and s 16(2) should not be read down as if it were. Rather, the relevant principle is that there may be defects which are capable of remedy and defects which are not.”

(c) Purpose of the doctrine of duplicity


	
	As Griffith CJ had indicated (Hedberg v Woodhall at 534), it had become necessary for an accused person to identify a defect which went “to the merits” of the case. An influential example of a duplicitous information which went to the merits was Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467. It was an offence in South Australia to be a licensee of premises which a person was found on or seen coming out from on a Sunday morning. A complainant proposed to lead evidence that there had been some thirty men seen coming out from the premises, but laid a complaint before a special magistrate charging a single offence on the basis that “certain persons” had been seen. That was amended to “a certain person”. The complainant refused to provide particulars of the men. A majority of the Court overturned the decisions of the South Australian Supreme Court and upheld the special magistrate’s dismissal of the complaint.
	
	
	As initially formulated, the complaint was duplicitous. As amended, duplicity was cured, because it only charged a single offence, but it continued to be bad because it was no longer possible for the defendant to know the particular offence he was called upon to answer. Strictly speaking, Johnson is not a decision on duplicity, but given its procedural history, it contains useful statements of the effect and purpose of the principle.
	
	
	One aspect on which Dixon and Evatt JJ placed considerable weight (and which anticipates precisely what it seems the EPA was and is seeking to achieve in its prosecution), was the need to know what evidence is admissible. Dixon J said at 487:
	


“Prima facie, but one offence can be proved under one charge. For, except to prove intent or system and to exclude accident or mistake, evidence that accused persons committed other like offences is seldom relevant to the issue of guilt. But, if the present case fell within the prima facie rule, plainly to admit evidence of thirty distinct offences would be contrary to law, and the fact that each satisfied the description contained in the complaint could afford no justification for such a breach of so important a rule.”


	
	Evatt J said at 497-498:
	


“It is an essential part of the concept of justice in criminal cases that not a single piece of evidence should be admitted against a defendant unless he has a right to resist its reception upon the ground of irrelevance, whereupon the court has both the right and the duty to rule upon such an objection. These fundamental rights cannot be exercised if, through a failure or refusal to specify or particularize the offence charged, neither the court nor the defendant (nor perhaps the prosecutor) is as yet aware of the offence intended to be charged. Indeed, the matter arises at an even earlier stage. The defendant cannot plead unless he knows what is the precise charge being preferred against him.”


	
	There are other purposes vindicated by the rules relating to duplicity, many of which were identified by Gaudron and McHugh JJ in S v The Queen at 284-286. But for present purposes, it is not necessary to go beyond what Dixon and Evatt JJ described as “so important a rule” and the “fundamental rights” in the passages extracted above.
	
	
	To return to the Land and Environment Court in 2012, ss 16(2) and 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act applied by reason of s 15(1) (“This Part applies, to the extent that it is capable of being applied, to all offences, however arising (whether under an Act or at common law), whenever committed and in whatever court dealt with”). Those modern counterparts, together with the power to order particulars, enabled the Land and Environment Court to deal with duplicity in the exercise of its Class 5 summary jurisdiction.
	


(d) Single criminal enterprise


	
	The application of the doctrine of duplicity is relatively straightforward when the elements of the offence are discrete, such as persons coming out of licensed premises on a Sunday morning (Johnson v Miller) or child sexual assault (S v The Queen) or wilfully demanding or recovering irrecoverable rent in rent-controlled premises in Iannella v French (1968) 119 CLR 84. Even so, as Dixon J observed in Johnson at 483, questions could arise as to whether the facts said to constitute the offence were “repetitions, not continuations” of the offence.
	
	
	It has long been the case that where acts formed part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise, they could be charged in a single count. The classic example, given by Viscount Reading CJ in Parker v Sutherland (1917) 86 LJKB 1052 at 1054, is keeping a brothel or keeping a gaming house. A single criminal enterprise has been said to exist in cases under former s 29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which created an indictable offence where “a person … defrauds the Commonwealth”, such as R v Moussad [1999] NSWCCA 337; (1999) 152 FLR 373 (nine fraudulent childcare fee relief claims submitted) and Taylor v The Queen [1997] TASSC 5; (1997) 6 Tas R 318 (31 fraudulent claims for sole parent pension), decisions which were considered in Calleija v R [2012] NSWCCA 37.
	
	
	In Director of Public Prosecutions v Merriman [1973] AC 584 at 607, Lord Diplock said that had been the practice since the eighteenth century. In the United Kingdom that is now reflected in r 14.2(2) of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2011, whereby “More than one incident of the commission of the offence may be included in a count if those incidents taken together amount to a course of conduct having regard to the time, place or purpose of commission”: see Archbold at 91. However, in Walsh v Tattersall, where a more relaxed approach was contended for, Kirby J said (at 110) that “A strict approach has been consistently applied by this Court from Johnson v Miller through Iannella v French and up to S v The Queen”. Gaudron and Gummow JJ decided the case on the basis that a statute making it an offence to “obtain by dishonest means any payment or other benefit under this Act” created a separate offence each time any payment or benefit was received, but that is consistent with the strict approach favoured by Kirby J.
	
	
	Thus the general rule is that unless the allegation constitutes a continuing offence or offences which are closely related amounting to the one activity they should be separately charged. Kirby J explained in Walsh v Tattersall at 107:
	


“If, for example, criminal acts occurred within a few minutes of time and in close physical proximity, could they be regarded as components of the one activity, so as to be susceptible to treatment as a single count? If the events were seen as part of the one transaction or criminal enterprise this approach has been held to be permissible in England. If a precise understanding of the charge laid, although evidenced by multiple acts, is that it represents a single crime, then a single count is permissible.”

That was applied in Cha v R [2012] NSWCCA 142 at [29] by McClellan CJ at CL with the agreement of Price and Button JJ.


	
	The question whether a statute attached criminality to an on-going criminal enterprise, as opposed to a particular act, is inevitably a question of construction. Hence, as Basten JA said in Rockdale Beef at [97]:
	


“The propriety of commencing proceedings in the form adopted by the prosecutor must commence with a consideration of the statutory provisions under which the charge was laid.”


	
	The principles were stated by Basten JA in Hannes v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 373; (2006) 165 A Crim R 151 at [9] and endorsed in Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87; (2010) 200 A Crim R 1 at [131]:
	


“There are two steps in the process of identifying duplicity or uncertainty. The first is to consider the statutory description of the offence in order to identify what is the act or conduct prohibited. The second is to identify the act or conduct set out in the pleading as constituting the offence in the particular case. Where a particular act is prohibited if it has one of a number of qualities, it is likely that only one offence is committed in relation to each act, even if such an act has more than one of the proscribed qualities.”

That echoes what Jordan CJ had said in Ex parte Polley; re McLennan (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 391 at 392, namely that the question whether an enactment creates one offence or several depends upon its subject matter and language considered in their context.  Accordingly, I turn to the terms of the statute.

(e) Construction of the POEO Act and the formulation of the alleged offence


	
	In the present case, the elements of the offence are (a) holding a licence and (b) any person contravening a condition of that licence. Section 64(2) creates a defence in certain circumstances where a person other than the holder of the licence causes the contravention of the condition.
	
	
	Here the condition of the Licence said to have been contravened was a condition that “Licensed activities must be carried out in a competent manner”. The “Licensed activities” included the “scheduled activity” specified in cl 41 of Schedule 1 as “Waste processing (non-thermal treatment)”. Clause 41 applied to five activities (non-thermal treatment of general waste, non-thermal treatment of hazardous and other waste, non-thermal treatment of liquid waste, non-thermal treatment of waste oil and non-thermal-treatment of waste tyres), each of which was defined as meaning “the receiving of [relevant waste]…and [its] processing otherwise than by thermal treatment”. Each of those activities became a “scheduled activity” under cl 41(3) of Schedule 1 to the POEO Act if it met certain criteria as to scale; in each case, one of those criteria was that the given activity “involves having on site at any time more than [the prescribed quantity] of [relevant waste]. Thus, the statutory definition and criteria that determine whether an activity is a “scheduled activity” look to receipt, “having on site” (i.e. storage) and processing.
	
	
	In the present case, the critical element of the offence alleged was the failure to carry out “waste processing (non-thermal treatment) in a competent manner”. It is plain that the non-thermal treatment of waste includes both the storage and processing of waste. Indeed that was express on the face of the Licence and, even if that were not so, those are elements required by the POEO Act to be present. It is plain that waste may be stored incompetently and processed incompetently. It is plain to my mind that doing either of those things incompetently would amount to a breach of the condition of the Licence.
	
	
	When one turns to the “Particulars to Amended Summons”, supplied after the benefit of a hearing and reasons, it is clear that the EPA chose to advance, under the one charge, separate claims that there was incompetent storage and incompetent treatment (a distinction resembling the statutory distinction between storage and processing). In my opinion, those particulars disclosed more than one offence.
	
	
	First, there was said to be storage which was not competently carried out on six days within a period of some three and a half weeks (2, 3, 14-16 and 18 June), whilst there was said to be treatment which was not competently carried out on six days (3, 4, 22, 28, 29 June and 1 July) in a similar period, all save one of which are different days. Secondly, the storage was said to have been carried out other than competently at seven places on the premises, while the treatment was said to be carried out other than competently at three places on the premises. That reflects the obvious facts that waste was stored in places other than where it was treated, and its competent storage involves quite different acts and omissions from its competent treatment. For example, it is not alleged that there was any incompetent treatment of waste on 18 June (although it is alleged that waste was discharged on that date constituting storage which was not competent). And it is not alleged that there was any incompetent storage of waste on 1 July, although waste is said to have been incompetently treated on that day. However, it seems equally obvious that incompetent storage could constitute a breach of condition considered alone, as may incompetent treatment. Test the matter this way: it is not the case, in my opinion, that the charge would inevitably fail unless both the storage and the treatment particulars were made out.
	
	
	The EPA submitted (written submissions, paragraph 60) that:
	


“the alleged criminality to be alleged against the respondent was that it was involved in a scheduled activity (Condition A1.2, Licence) and, that it did not carry out that scheduled activity in a competent manner, on the licensed premises (Condition A2.1, Licence), the licenced activity of the ‘treatment, storage, processing, reprocessing, transport and disposal of waste generated by the activity’ (Condition O1.1(5), Licence).”


	
	It may be accepted that the scheduled activity of “Waste processing (non-thermal treatment)” was one of the licensed activities, and that all aspects of it, including “treatment, storage, processing, reprocessing, transport and disposal of the waste generated by” the licensed activity were required to be carried out in a competent manner. But in my opinion, in circumstances where as here what is to be carried out competently are different (albeit related) activities, one of which is storage, another of which is treatment, the fact that the condition deals with that conduct collectively is not to the point. The element of the offence is the contravention of the condition. But the condition, no differently from the Act, refers in terms to both storage and treatment. A contravention will occur when treatment is undertaken other than competently, and a contravention will also occur when storage is undertaken other than competently. In other words, it is not necessary in order to breach a condition requiring the carrying out of a scheduled activity competently to store waste incompetently and to process waste incompetently.
	
	
	In an attempt to defend its submission that there was but a single offence, the EPA advanced submissions which involved what, to my mind, amounts to an exceedingly fine distinction. One example is found in paragraph 74 of its written submissions:
	


“Section 64 … says: ‘If any condition of a licence is contravened.’ It does not say: ‘If any contravention of a condition of a licence.’ [sic] Or: ‘If the manner in which a licence condition was contravened’. [sic]”


	
	However, as Windeyer J said in Iannella v French at 106:
	


“To ask what would be the effect of an Act if it were differently worded is a roundabout and often dangerous way of seeking its meaning and effect worded as it is.”

In my view, little assistance is obtained in this appeal from the inquiry the EPA would wish to make.


	
	The EPA also submitted (paragraph 78):
	


“It matters not, for proof of the offence, how often, or in how many ways, the licensee failed to carry out the scheduled activities in a competent manner. The respondent was alleged to be guilty of one offence, and one offence only, during that period. The particulars provided the circumstances, over that period, in which the applicant alleges the respondent was not competent in carrying out its licensed activity. The fact that those particulars identify a number of circumstances in which the applicant alleges the respondent was not carrying out its activities in a competent manner is not an allegation of more than one offence. The Condition was breached by the conduct of the respondent that demonstrated the scheduled activities were not carried out in a manner that was competent.”


	
	I do not agree. The question is one of construction of the statute. Section 64 penalises conduct which contravenes a licence condition. In my opinion, the primary judge was right to conclude that a failure to treat adequately, and a failure to store adequately, give rise to separate and discrete omissions which independently give rise to an offence.
	
	
	As was said (in a different context) in this Court by Miles J, with Street CJ agreeing, in R v Manwaring [1983] 2 NSWLR 82 at 88, a decision which this Court said was “instructive” in Davis v R [2006] NSWCCA 392 at [45]:
	


“It does not necessarily follow…that, by bringing all forms of forcible abduction into one section, Parliament intended that one offence only was thereby to be created. There are numerous examples in the Crimes Act of single sections which penalize more than one distinct type of behaviour and thereby create multiple offences, for instance the various types of attempt to murder provided for in ss 27 to 29. The problem in the present case is whether forcible abduction with intent to marry or carnally know a female is a different ‘act’ from forcible abduction with intent to cause a female to be married to or carnally known by any person.”


	
	So too here. Section 64 brings all forms of contraventions of licence conditions into a single section. But that merely requires one to turn to the conditions of the licence alleged to have been contravened. Although the prosecutor has relied only on a contravention of condition O.1, that of itself cannot in my view be determinative of the question of duplicity. The question is one of substance, not form, and as soon as one considers the activities which are authorised by the Licence and which are particularised by the prosecutor, one can immediately see the distinct conduct (both acts and omissions) which suffices to constitute an offence.
	
	
	I would reach that conclusion unassisted by authority. However, authority is not lacking. As the primary judge pointed out, Chugg v Pacific Dunlop Ltd [1988] VR 411 concerned an information based on the obligation on an employer to “provide and maintain so far as is practicable for employees a working environment that is safe and without risks to health”, and the particulars identified several acts and omissions. Fullagar J held the information duplicitous. Boral Gas (NSW) Pty Ltd v Magill (1995) 37 NSWLR 150 concerned the New South Wales counterpart. Hill J said that many of the acts and omissions identified as failures were “disparate in nature and content”, and involved “different items of plant, different systems of work, different operations and procedures, different locations on the premises, … [and] different risks of danger to different employees” (at 179). His Honour said that the gist of the offence was each act or omission which breached the obligation to ensure the health, safety and welfare of an employer’s employees. Hungerford J also found that the disparate acts amounted to more than one offence.
	
	
	As the primary judge noted at [31]-[33] of his First reasons, a new section was inserted into the legislation following Boral Gas expressly overriding the doctrine of duplicity. That provision was later moved to s 31(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000, which provided:
	


“More than one contravention of a provision of Divison 1 by a person that arise out of the same factual circumstances may be charged as a single offence or as separate offences.”


	
	When that provision was considered in John Holland Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of NSW [2010] NSWCA 338; (2010) 202 IR 82, Spigelman CJ said at [71]:
	


“Section 31(1) is facultative and permits a course which common law principles of duplicity would not permit.”


	
	The primary judge referred to Environment Protection Authority v Sydney Water Corporation Ltd (1997) 98 LGERA 361, which was about a procedural ruling in the course of a prosecution. It was relied on by the EPA, however, for its apparent endorsement (necessarily obiter) of the proposition that a prosecution based on a single offence comprising a failure to maintain industrial plant installed on premises in an efficient condition contrary to a licence condition could be particularised by reference to five separate items of equipment, on the basis that the sewerage treatment plant was “a single entity wherein the free flow of liquids is interrupted by individual items of plant” (at 362). Gleeson CJ said (at 363) that:
	


“Charging a single offence in such circumstances is consistent with authority and practice in criminal cases: see, eg, Director of Public Prosecutions v Merriman [1973] AC 584; R v Hamzy (1994) 74 A Crim R 341.”


	
	Each case turns on the elements of the offence the subject of the charge. In Sydney Water, the charge was failure to maintain industrial plant in an efficient condition. There may or may not have been a factual dispute as to whether the five items were separate items of plant, although from their nature (certain penstocks, certain penstock controls, an item called “7 - Section Siphon and stopboards”, a particular raw sewerage pump and electrical control equipment which powered that pump) they would seem to have been closely linked operationally. Likewise, in Hakim v Waterways Authority of NSW [2006] NSWCCA 376; (2006) 149 LGERA 415, the statutory offence was to “make an excavation on, in or under protected land” and the single charge extended to two excavations on the same site, separated in time, and a third excavation immediately following the second. Spigelman CJ held (with the agreement of Grove and Bell JJ) that although it would have been open to lay separate charges (at [82]), there was no reason as a matter of construction for excavation to be narrowly construed (at [87]):
	


“Nothing in the scope and purpose of the legislative scheme suggests that the word ‘excavation’ requires a process of specification of each distinct act capable of constituting, in some technical or other sense, a different excavation. It is appropriate that the prohibited conduct should be understood as extending to a course of conduct over a period of time pursuant to an overall scheme.”


	
	Likewise, the present case is different from CSR Ltd v Environmental Protection Authority [2000] NSWCCA 373; (2000) 110 LGERA 334 where there was held to be no duplicity in a single charge based on an act which was alleged both to harm the environment and to be likely to harm the environment. As Smart AJ said for the Court at [35]:
	


“There is a close connection between the concepts of a leak harming the environment and a leak likely to harm the environment. Frequently, the leak of the polluting substance will do both.”


	
	Matters of fact and degree are apt to arise where duplicity is alleged. However, storage is different from treatment, and the storage alleged to have been performed incompetently took place on different days, and with different equipment, from the treatment which is alleged to have been performed incompetently. In the present case, the charge extends to failure to store and failure to treat. Let it be assumed, favourably to the EPA, that all of the machinery and facilities on Truegain’s premises formed a single “entity”. Nevertheless, it is plain on the face of the particulars that the conduct and omissions giving rise to the alleged incompetent storage is different (in time, in location, and in content) from the conduct and omissions giving rise to the alleged incompetent treatment.
	
	
	Ultimately, but to my mind revealingly, the EPA complained that (written submissions at paragraph 6) (references omitted):
	


“a large amount of highly probative evidence will be inadmissible in the prosecution of the respondent, which, in effect, will substantially weaken the applicant’s case against the respondent. Thus, the respondent will not be exposed to the full alleged criminality that is proposed to be alleged against it.”


	
	In my opinion, that submission tends to expose the true position of the EPA - which is that the full alleged criminality is more serious than the single charge in the summons. That is precisely the vice to which the statements made by Dixon and Evatt JJ extracted above in Johnson v Miller were directed. The EPA’s stance is contrary to what Evatt J said was an “essential part of the concept of justice in criminal cases”. In my opinion, there should be a grant of leave, but grounds 1 to 10 of the EPA’s appeal should be dismissed.
	


Costs


	
	It will be recalled that in his Third reasons the primary judge ordered that the summons be amended by deleting the particulars on which the EPA could not rely, and made a costs order against the EPA based on s 68 of the LEC Act.
	
	
	It has often been said that traditionally the Crown neither paid nor received costs (see for example Attorney-General of Queensland v Holland (1912) 15 CLR 46 at 49 and Solomons v District Court of New South Wales [2002] HCA 47; (2002) 211 CLR 119 at [72]), but in truth the situation was far more complex (as is explained in Sir John Simon KC’s argument in Swift & Co v Board of Trade [1926] 2 KB 131 at 137-140 and by Roger Quick and David Garnsworthy, Quick on Costs, Chapter 2). In criminal litigation for summary offences, provision was long ago made by statute for applications for costs following unsuccessful prosecutions: see the review of the legislation of each Australian State and mainland Territory by Dawson J in Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534 at 547-554.
	
	
	Although Chancery asserted a power to order costs independently of statute: see Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at [33]-[34], this appeal has proceeded on the basis that it was necessary to identify a statutory source of power to award costs in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction. That reflects what was said in Barton v Berman [1980] 1 NSWLR 63 at 67 by Hope JA, with whom Glass JA agreed (“In respect of proceedings upon indictment, there was no statutory provision for costs before the [Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967] statute, and orders were not made in favour of or against the Crown”) and by Mason CJ’s opening statement in Latoudis at 537 (that the question was what were “the criteria to be applied by a court of summary jurisdiction in exercising a statutory discretion to award costs in criminal proceedings which have terminated in favour of a defendant”). Nothing in these reasons is directed to whether and when costs might be ordered in the exercise by a superior court of its jurisdiction to guard against abuse of process, as to which (in a civil case) see Partington v Pacific Link Housing Ltd [2013] NSWCA 259 at [63]-[75].
	
	
	Subsections 68(1) and (4) of the LEC Act in their current form are as follows (subsections (2) and (3) deal with irregularities and reflect the former s 81 of the Supreme Court Act 1970):
	


“(1) In any proceedings before the Court, the Court shall have power at any stage of the proceeding to order, upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as the Court thinks fit, any amendments to be made which, in the opinion of the Court, are necessary in the interests of justice.

(4) This section does not apply to proceedings in Class 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the Court’s jurisdiction.”


	
	Subsection 68(1), on which the primary judge relied, has never been amended. Subsection (4) was added in 2007 (by Item 27 of Schedule 6 of the Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2007) at the time the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules became applicable to proceedings in classes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Court’s jurisdiction (see Schedule 2, Item 9 of the same Act, and Uniform Civil Procedure Rules (Amendment No 20) 2007, Schedule 1, Item 11).
	
	
	Section 68(1) is in materially identical terms to the powers conferred upon the Land and Valuation Court and before it the Land Appeal Court by s 16 of the Land and Valuation Court Act 1921 and s 7 of the Crown Lands (Amending and Declaratory) Act 1912 respectively. Those two courts of course had no summary jurisdiction, and had a general power to order costs (see s 18 of the 1921 Act and s 8(III) of the Crown Lands Act 1889).
	
	
	When the Land and Environment Court was created in 1979, s 69(2) conferred a power to order costs, which was not only “[s]ubject to the rules and subject to any other Act”, but which also did not apply to proceedings in Class 5 of the Court's jurisdiction: see s 69(9). Part 4 Division 5 contained “Special provisions respecting Class 5 proceedings (summary jurisdiction)” one of which was s 52(1), which conferred a power to award costs in three circumstances. If the Court convicted a person or made an order pursuant to s 556A of the Crimes Act 1900 it was empowered to order that the person pay costs, and if the Court “makes an order dismissing the charge” then it could order the prosecutor to pay the defendant's costs. Section 52(2) provided that “[t]he amount so ordered to be paid for costs shall in all cases be specified in the conviction or order”. Indeed, in Oshlack at [18], Gaudron and Gummow JJ said, contrasting it with s 69, that “In respect of summary proceedings, s 52 of the [LEC Act] prescribes its own costs regime”. Section 52 was copied verbatim from s 14 of the Supreme Court (Summary Jurisdiction) Act 1967.
	
	
	The list of matters falling within the Court's Class 5 jurisdiction has expanded since 1979 (from proceedings under six specified Acts in 1979 to seventeen in 2013). However, the Court still hears and disposes of those proceedings “in a summary manner”: s 21. The special provisions in Part 4 Division 5 described above have been replaced by s 41 which provides that “Part 5 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 applies to proceedings in Class 5 of the Court’s jurisdiction”. Part 5 of Chapter 4 of the 1986 Act is headed “Summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and other higher courts”. Division 4 within that Part addresses costs. That Division contains provisions which are broadly similar to those originally found in s 52, limiting the circumstances in which a costs order could be made in the exercise of summary criminal jurisdiction. Section 257B permits an order of costs in favour of a prosecutor if the person is convicted or if the court makes an order under section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 257C(1) provides that:
	


“A court may at the end of proceedings under this Part order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court, for payment to the accused person, if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn.”


	
	It is clear that ss 257B and 257C(1) closely resemble the power originally conferred by s 52(1).
	
	
	Section 257C(2) requires the order either to state the amount of costs, or to have that amount agreed or assessed. That reflects an expansion of the original limitation imposed by s 52(2). Section 257D imposes a limitation upon the order of costs against a prosecutor, the gravamen of which is that the prosecutor was acting unreasonably or improperly or there were some other exceptional circumstances to make a costs order just and reasonable. That represented a clarification of the previous practice, as to which Jacobs JA had said in Ex parte Justelius; Re Lucas (1970) 92 WN (NSW) 455 at 456, that “I am not sure that past practice has ever been quite consistent on the subject”. Finally, s 257F confers a power to order costs if a matter is adjourned.
	
	
	In my opinion, that review of the legislative scheme reveals the following propositions.
	
	
	First, when the Court was created in 1979 with both civil and summary criminal jurisdiction, separate provision was made as to costs. The predecessors of that Court only exercised civil jurisdiction and had a single power to order costs. An innovation in 1979 was the conferral of criminal jurisdiction: see B Preston, “Operating an environment court: The experience of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales” (2008) 25 Environmental and Planning Law Journal 385 at 387. At the same time, the Court was given two separate powers to order costs: the general power under s 69 applicable to all proceedings other than those in Class 5, and the special power in s 52 in respect of proceedings in Class 5 of the Court's jurisdiction. Those powers were distinct: for example, the power under s 52 was limited in that it was necessary for the order to specify the amount of costs, while that under s 69 was not so confined. They were treated as distinct in Oshlack at [18] and [29]. Importantly for present purposes, the power in s 52 turning as it did on the outcome of the trial, was only available when the proceeding had been determined.
	
	
	Secondly, the power to order amendments “at any stage of the proceeding” and “upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as the Court thinks fit” was not a separate power to confer costs. It was a power to order amendments which presupposed that, in the event that a term as to costs was imposed, the power to do so would be found elsewhere. As a matter of ordinary language, s 68 was not drafted in a way apt to confer a power relating to costs.
	
	
	To construe s 68 as a power relating to costs also sits uneasily with its history, for its source was the power in the Land and Valuation Court where there could never be an occasion to order costs in summary jurisdiction and where there was always a source of power to order costs in civil proceedings elsewhere conferred.
	
	
	What is more, to conclude that s 68 constitutes a third source of power to order costs would be to undercut the evident legislative scheme disclosed by the Act as a whole. For the qualified powers in s 52 and s 69 between them applied to every matter within the Court's jurisdiction, and they did so in different terms and subject to different conditions. The position was explained by Spigelman CJ in The Ombudsman v Laughton [2005] NSWCA 339; (2005) 64 NSWLR 114 at [19]:
	


“Where any conflict arises with the general words of another provision, the very generality of the words of which indicates that the legislature is not able to identify or even anticipate every circumstance in which it may apply, the legislature is taken not to have intended to impinge upon its own comprehensive regime of a specific character.”


	
	The reasoning of French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ in Australian Education Union v Department of Education and Children's Services [2012] HCA 3; (2012) 86 ALJR 217 at [31] is to similar effect:
	


“Even if it were possible to characterise the power conferred upon the Minister by s 15 as a specific power carved out of a more general power conferred by s 9(4), the interpretative principle enunciated in Anthony Hordern & Sons Ltd v Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia would require that the general power be read as not applying to the subject matter of the specific power.”


	
	In the present case, the separateness of the two powers in ss 52 and 69 together applying to the universe of proceedings within the Land and Environment Court's jurisdiction, with each power expressed in different terms and subject to different conditions, is antithetical to the conferral of a general power applicable where an amendment was made. That is to say, there is in my opinion no good reason to identify a third power, in s 68 (which immediately precedes s 69), which was also applicable in civil litigation in relation to costs where there is an amendment, and which was also applicable in the exercise of summary jurisdiction in addition to s 52.
	
	
	I am conscious that laws granting powers to a court are construed differently from other legislative grants - they are given “the most liberal construction”, for the reasons given by Gaudron J in Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd (1992) 174 CLR 178 at 205, which were endorsed by the High Court in Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia [2006] HCA 38; (2006) 226 CLR 486 at [10]. But in my view the 1979 language is inapt to confer a power, and further any such power would undermine the legislative scheme.
	
	
	So far I have considered the position in 1979. The third proposition is that nothing in the subsequent amendments has altered the position. Three things happened in the ensuing decades. The Court's Class 5 jurisdiction was expanded, the special provisions in Part 4 Division 5 of the LEC Act were replaced by Part 5 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and the power to order costs in civil proceedings is now found in the Civil Procedure Act 2005, not s 69. (Since the applicability of the Uniform Rules of Civil Procedure and the Civil Procedure Act, the power in matters in classes 1, 2, 3 and 4 is now found in s 98 of that Act.)
	
	
	However, none of those changes is apt to confer an additional, free-standing power to order costs. In particular, the inclusion of s 68(4) did not convert s 68(1) to a power to order costs at an interlocutory stage in Class 5 proceedings. Subsection (4) subtracted from the operation of s 68(1) (at a time when the UCPR applied to proceedings in Classes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Court’s jurisdiction); it did not convert s 68(1) into a separate source of power to order costs, and it did not undermine the proposition that there continued to be separate sources of power for costs in civil and criminal matters.
	
	
	Fourthly, the conferral of power by s 257C, carrying with it conditions as to time (“at the end of proceedings”) and circumstances (satisfaction of one of the circumstances in s 257D) is not to be undermined by construing s 68 so as to yield an independent, unqualified power. In the exercise of the summary jurisdiction of the Land and Environment Court, the Legislature has long made it clear that costs may be ordered, but only if the matter is dismissed. It is easy to discern a legislative policy that those found guilty of offences should not be permitted to obtain costs. It is also easy to discern a legislative policy that the question of unreasonableness or other improper maintenance of a prosecution is to be determined only at the end of the trial (including, perhaps, on different evidence than was adduced at the trial).
	
	
	Fifthly, as noted earlier in these reasons when dealing with duplicity, a specific power to amend was and is conferred on all courts exercising summary jurisdiction when a defect has been identified. That power is now found in s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act. True it is that that power is “in addition to and not in derogation of any other power of the court for the same or similar purposes” (s 21(6)). But in my opinion, that is a further reason why the power under s 68 should not be construed to confer a free-standing power to order costs. (The primary judge did not purport to rely on s 21. For completeness, I note that although s 21 confers power to make “such order as appears necessary”, similar reasoning confines those general words so as not to support a power to order costs in a way which would undermine s 257C.)
	
	
	Sixthly, the foregoing accords with principle. Where a prosecutor invokes the judicial power of the State in order to punish a wrongdoer, it has long been the case that costs are addressed separately. “Different considerations arise in criminal proceedings which are brought, not for private ends, but for public purposes”: Latoudis at 557 (Dawson J). Although one must be cautious of arguments based upon a classification of proceedings as either “civil” or “criminal” (cf Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 49; (2003) 216 CLR 161 at [114]), it is plain that for many years, in relation to the question of costs, the Legislature has enacted different regimes turning upon that classification.
	
	
	For those reasons, in my respectful opinion, the primary judge was wrong to conclude that s 68(1) was a separate head of power to order costs (at [18]), and wrong to say that it was not inconsistent with s 257C (at [22]). When the question is one of inconsistency of powers in separate statutes, the first question is one of construction, and not lightly will an earlier, generally worded power be held to cut across a specific, qualified and later power. In my opinion, such statutory power as the Land and Environment Court has to order costs in respect of proceedings in Class 5 of its jurisdiction is regulated by the Criminal Procedure Act. The costs order made in Wakool Shire Council v Garrision Cattle Feeders Pty Ltd is to be regarded as being made per incuriam, as was that made Sutherland Shire Council v Benedict Industries Pty Ltd [2013] NSWLEC 121 at [35] in reliance on the decision the subject of this appeal: [2012] NSWLEC 78.
	
	
	Nothing in these reasons will prevent Truegain from applying for a costs order, at the conclusion of the proceedings, in the event that it can satisfy the elements of ss 257C and 257D, as regularly occurs (see for example Port Macquarie - Hastings Council v Lawlor Services Pty Ltd (No 7) [2008] NSWLEC 75; (2008) 159 LGERA 87 and Director-General, NSW Department of Industry & Investment v Coomes [2012] NSWLEC 251).
	
	
	That is sufficient to deal with the balance of the appeal. I am conscious that pages 52-54 of the EPA’s excessively long submissions challenge the finding of exceptional circumstances, although nothing was said orally about this (or indeed by the EPA about costs at all). The submissions are outside the issues identified in the notice of appeal. In any event, in my opinion, they should be rejected, and given that they are not dispositive of any aspect of the appeal, I will do so concisely.
	
	
	The factual criticisms advanced by the EPA (written submissions, paragraph 158) of the primary judge’s chronology of the prosecutor’s conduct of the proceedings, and my conclusions regarding those criticisms, are as follows:
	



	
	It is said that no order was sought by Truegain for particulars on 7 October 2011. But the first two orders handed to her Honour on that day by junior counsel sought directions for particulars, who also spoke to them (Transcript 2.24).
	
	
	It is said that at no stage did the EPA refuse to supply particulars to Truegain. That submission turns on the propositions that the expert’s report and the 254 paragraph draft statement of agreed facts were particulars. Those propositions are incorrect, in my opinion, self-evidently so.
	
	
	It is said that two slippages of the timetable by the EPA were consented to by Truegain. That appears to be so, but is largely irrelevant: the gravamen of Lloyd AJ’s criticism was the persistent breaches of timetable (as to most of which the EPA has made no submission on the appeal) and the delay in providing particulars.
	



	
	In other respects, it is to be regretted that the EPA continued to advance written submissions in this Court that were factually incorrect. Only one was developed in oral submissions. It was said, in writing and orally, that the draft statement of facts was in evidence before the primary judge on the first hearing. But an examination of the transcript and the affidavits which were read makes it plain, as senior counsel for Truegain pointed out - in writing and orally - that that was not so (see 7 March 2012, T4.1-13 and 32.12 (where the EPA read a different affidavit from that annexing the draft statement)). The criticism that “his Honour at no time considered the detailed particulars that had been served upon the respondent in the statement of agreed facts” (paragraph 24 of the EPA’s submissions) is therefore doubly ill-founded: not only does it wrongly assume that the draft statement of agreed facts was particulars, but it also wrongly assumes the draft statement was in evidence before his Honour. The written submissions on factual matters which the EPA did not advance orally were likewise incorrect. Truegain described this aspect of the EPA’s written submissions, in my view accurately, as “replete with errors and omissions”, and identified thirteen factual errors, in each case specifically providing transcript references. Those factual errors should have been corrected by the prosecutor after they had been drawn to its attention by Truegain. However, nothing turns on the way the EPA presented its case on appeal (and in particular, no question of costs can arise in this Court: Criminal Appeal Act, s 17).
	
	
	For those reasons, I propose these orders:
	


1.   Leave to appeal be granted and appeal allowed in part.

2.   Set aside the order for costs, being order 2, made on 18 April 2012.

3.   Otherwise dismiss the appeal.

	BUTTON J: I agree with Leeming JA.

		15 November 2016",2013-08-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706236,R v Slacke [2013] NSWSC 1215,"Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  Natasha Slack (""the offender"") was today arraigned upon an indictment alleging first, an offence of being an accessory after the fact to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and alternatively, hindering the apprehension of a person who had committed the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent.  
2The offender pleaded not guilty to the first count but guilty to the second count.  The Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment.  
3The offence is contrary to s 315 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and there is prescribed for it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years.  It is an offence that may be dealt with summarily pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) and, if dealt with in the Local Court, the maximum that can be imposed is imprisonment for two years.
Facts 
4There is a statement of agreed facts and I draw the following from that document.
5The matter concerns events on 10 January 2012 that ultimately led to the tragic death of Mr Alan Henry.  Sometime in the first half of 2011, the offender and the deceased met and struck up some sort of relationship.  The offender lived in Port Stephens but visited the deceased on occasions and stayed at his home in Gloucester.  In about the middle of that year, the offender's then boyfriend, Jason Grogan, began to accompany her on these visits.  After an event in early July 2011, there was an argument involving Mr Henry and Mr Grogan that culminated in Mr Henry making it clear that Mr Grogan was not welcome at his home.
6On 10 January 2012, the offender and Jason Grogan drove to Gloucester.  At about 4.30 pm they were at the Caltex Service Station in Gloucester where they were seen by a number of witnesses to be engaging in a very loud argument.  Mr Grogan's behaviour was described as violent and aggressive and it was to the extent that bystanders were prompted to intervene to restrain him for the protection of the offender.  Ultimately, a police officer was flagged down by a motorist and attended the scene.  Mr Grogan disappeared while the officer spoke with the offender. 
7The offender engaged in a telephone conversation with Mr Henry.  She passed the phone to the police officer.  This was at about 5.10pm.  Mr Henry told the officer that the offender was welcome to stay at his home but he was emphatic that Mr Grogan was not welcome.  
8Mr Grogan, in fact, went to the home of the deceased while the offender was speaking with the police officer.  He entered the home and used unlawful violence towards the deceased that resulted in him sustaining a significant head injury.  Grogan then stole the deceased's laptop computer and fled from the home. 9The offender attended Mr Henry's home a short time later.  She found him lying on the kitchen floor and called triple-0.  The call was logged at 5.31 pm.  Grogan must have left the premises only minutes before.  When the ambulance officers arrived they found Mr Henry prone on the kitchen floor.  He was unconscious and had signs consistent with a significant head injury.  There was a pool of blood on the floor around his head; he had trauma to his left ear; and a contusion and swelling to his right forehead.   
10Mr Henry was taken to hospital where he was found to be still deeply unconscious.  There was a significant laceration behind his left ear and grazes to his right forearm and shoulder.  He had suffered a severe brain injury requiring specialist treatment.  He was evacuated by air ambulance to Sydney and admitted to Westmead Hospital. 11Soon after the ambulance had left, a neighbour was drawn to an argument taking place on the back verandah of the deceased's home.  It involved the offender and Grogan and included Grogan saying, ""It's gone too far you can't back out now"".  The pair went inside the premises and were there until two police officers arrived at the front door at about 7.18 pm.  The officers had been alerted to the incident that had earlier occurred at the home and were making enquiries.  As they approached the house they heard a male and female within the premises and saw an outline of a female figure and a male figure.  These persons were the offender and Mr Grogan.  Mr Grogan moved quickly into the kitchen and out of view; but the officers would still hear whispering inside the house.  
12They knocked on the door and the offender answered.  When the officers asked to come in the offender told them that she was not going to let them.  She became agitated and said, ""You can't come in, get a warrant, he only had a fall"".  When they persisted the offender responded, ""Yeah well I've had a bad day too.  I've come all the way up here, had a fight with Jase, and then see someone with their head bashed in"".  
13The offender's choice of words was questioned and she replied, ""I didn't mean to say that, I meant someone who's fallen and bashed their head"".  She continued to refuse to allow the police to enter the premises; again telling them to get a warrant.  She closed the door. 14One of the officers went to the rear of the house.  He noticed that the back door and screen door were both wide open.  The offender rushed to the door and stopped the officer from entering saying, ""You can't come in here, you don't have a warrant"".  When the officer told her that he needed to find out what had happened, she said, ""He was fucking bashed, oh fuck I didn't mean to say that, he fell over and just hit his head"".  The officer asked the offender, ""Where the male person who had been in the house a short time before was?""  She replied, ""There is no one fucking here, I was here by myself.  You fucking cops are all the fucking same"".  Ultimately, the offender agreed to allow the two officers to enter.  
15It is the actions of the offender in delaying the police entry and thereby permitting Mr Grogan time to flee the premises that is the gravamen of the charge to which she has pleaded guilty. 16The officers left and made various enquiries and returned to the house later in the evening.  On this occasion they saw the offender walking out from the front of the house and down the street with Mr Grogan trailing behind her.  The officers called out to Mr Grogan to stop because they needed to speak with him but he fled and could not be found. 17Later in the evening the police returned to the deceased's home and found the offender once again inside.  She was told that the house had been declared a crime scene and she was ejected.  Later that evening, she was at a hotel in Gloucester where she was observed to have a bruised eye.  Sometime after that, ambulance officers were called as the offender was unconscious on the verandah of the hotel.  She was found to be in a drunken stupor and she had bruising to her left eye which had not been present when the police had earlier spoken to her.  She was taken to hospital. 18On 17 January 2012, police found the offender and Mr Grogan in Taree.  They were both arrested for the assault upon the deceased.  The offender agreed to be interviewed.  In part she said that when she went to the deceased's home on the afternoon of 10 January she had consumed about two litres of wine.  When she entered, she found deceased lying on the floor with ""a little bit of blood on him"".  She told the police that she thought he must have slipped while taking the garbage out. 19Mr Henry spent a considerable period of time at Westmead Hospital where he was treated for a serious brain injury.  His condition remained very poor and he was discharged to a nursing home in Erina on 27 March, but sadly passed away on 19 April 2012.
Procedural history
20Mr Grogan was charged with murder and I have presided over his trial over the past few weeks.  A jury found him guilty of murder after a relatively short period of deliberation on Tuesday of this week.  He has been remanded in custody for sentence later this year.
21The offender was due to be tried jointly with Grogan but his counsel successfully applied for a separate trial.  It had been proposed that the offender's trial commence before me today, without a jury, but ultimately a trial became unnecessary.
Matters personal to the offender
22The offender is aged thirty-five.  She has a fairly lengthy criminal history.  It comprises a considerable number of convictions for dishonesty offences.  It has the hallmarks of a person who has experienced a problem with illicit drugs.  She has not been imprisoned, as I understand the records, until 2012 when she was sentenced to two months imprisonment for an offence of being carried in a conveyance taken without the consent of the owner.  She has spent two days in custody solely referable to the present matter and that will be taken into account in my assessment of sentence. 23It has been put to me in submissions by Mr Watson, counsel for the offender, that the relationship of the offender with Mr Grogan was one characterised by violence and intimidation by him towards her.  It was submitted that she was subjected to repeated physical abuse.  I note from the criminal record that was tendered in the sentence proceedings of Mr Grogan that he has a significant history of offences of violence and so I tend to accept the characterisation of the relationship as put to me by counsel. 24The offender has a history of difficulties with illicit drugs and alcohol.  I was informed that she was addicted to heroin in her later teenage years but overcame that, but then had an enduring problem with alcohol abuse.  She returned to the use of illicit drugs from the time she commenced her relationship with Mr Grogan.   25The offender is now in a new relationship with a man with whom she lives in the Kempsey area.  I am told that this man does not have any difficulty with alcohol and is helping the offender to deal with the difficulty that she has had in that respect.  The offender has a ten-year-old daughter who, because of intervention by the Department of Community Services as a result of the offender's alcohol problem, lives in Forster with her natural father.   26The offender is currently receiving a NewStart allowance.  She does have some vocational qualification in hospitality.   27She seems to have some mental health difficulties in terms of depression and anxiety, for which she is taking medication. Assessment of sentence
28It has been put, in effect, that the objective seriousness of the offence is at a low level.  Reference was made to the immediate response of the offender in calling triple 0 after she came across the deceased lying on the kitchen floor, thereby demonstrating her concern for his wellbeing.  
29The facts that underpin the charge to which she has pleaded indicate that her actions were relatively brief in delaying the police entry to the home so as to permit Grogan to escape apprehension.  I do accept, in the range of conduct that can give rise to an offence against s 315, that this offence falls at the lower level. 30I have not heard any evidence from the offender, and so I am unable to make any findings in her favour as to matters such as remorse.  I get the impression from the submissions that were made that her prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable.  I cannot put it any higher than that without evidence that would support more favourable findings.  
31She does get credit for her plea of guilty but it was relatively late in the piece, although it was the result of negotiation that brought about a less serious charge.  It is of some value to her in the assessment of sentence.  I do not intend to quantify it any further than what I have just said. 32It has been put to me that the appropriate disposition of the matter is by way of s 9 good behaviour bond.  The Crown has not sought to be heard in opposition to that proposal.  There is a question of whether, if I acceded to that, I should impose conditions as to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service.  I do not, of course, have any assessment by that Service as to the need for any involvement by it.  It seems to me that it would be unnecessary in the circumstances to impose such a condition but I do accede to the submission that the matter should be resolved in that way. Sentence
33For the offence of hindering the apprehension of Jason Grogan for a serious indictable offence, you are convicted.  I order that you enter into a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a period of two years.  It will be a condition of the bond that you notify the Registrar of the Supreme Court in Sydney of any change of address within seven days of such change.

2706246,Ngati v R [2013] NSWCCA 203,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Schmidt J. 

2McCALLUM J: I agree with Schmidt J, for substantially the reasons her Honour has stated. As to the fact that the offence to which the applicant ultimately pleaded guilty was a table 1 offence, I would add that I doubt whether a judge of the experience of Berman DCJ would have overlooked that consideration. In my view, his Honour's starting point for the sentence on that charge was high by comparison with those of the co-offenders for the aggravated offence. For that reason, I would respectfully not join in Schmidt J's characterisation of the sentences as entailing considerable leniency. However, considerations of parity were informed in this case by the applicant's separate offending (in both the driving charge and the earlier assault) and the fact that he had committed the present offences whilst on bail. I have not been persuaded that the sentence for the s112(1) offence was manifestly excessive or that any justified sense of grievance should arise when the overall structure of the sentences is taken into account.

3SCHMIDT J: Johnny Ngati pleaded guilty to one offence of break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for which was 14 years imprisonment and a second police pursuit offence contrary to s 51B(1) of that Act, the maximum penalty for which was 3 years imprisonment. He seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed for the s 112(1) offence.

4The offences were both committed on 21 September 2011, while the applicant was at liberty on bail in respect of an alleged offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On 5 October 2012, when he was sentenced by Berman DCJ for his further offending, he was serving the sentence imposed upon him for that assault. His non-parole period for that offence was due to expire on 29 October 2012. By application of the principle of totality, his Honour took this into account by fixing 30 April 2012 as the start date for the s 51B(1) offence. In the result this sentence was made concurrent with the sentence imposed for the assault, by some 6 months. 

5His Honour also imposed partially concurrent sentences for the two offences for which he sentenced the applicant by imposing:


a fixed term of imprisonment of one year, to date from 30 April 2012 for the s 51B(1) offence; and


a term of imprisonment of 3 years, 6 months for the s 112(1) offence, dating from 30 December 2012, with a non-parole period of 18 months, to expire on 29 June 2014 and the balance of term of 2 years expiring on 29 June 2016. 

6The period of this concurrence was some 4 months. His Honour also imposed a 12-month period of disqualification from driving from the date of sentencing, 5 October 2012. 

7Given the seriousness of the applicant's offences, it is evident that he received considerable leniency in this sentencing exercise. The Crown did not appeal these sentences, however, and accordingly, in these proceedings the sentence imposed for the s 51B(1) offence is only relevant, in so far as the sentence for the s 112(1) offence was made partially concurrent by some 4 months with that sentence. 

Grounds of appeal

8The Crown did not oppose the leave sought. 

9The grounds of appeal pressed were:

1. failing to give sufficient weight to the applicant's lesser role in the offence

2. failing to give any weight to his contrition

3. failing to give sufficient weight to the parity principle for the break enter offence

4. that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.


The entry of the plea

10The applicant originally pleaded not guilty to both the s 51B offence and to a count under s 112(2). His co-offenders both pleaded guilty to s 112(2) offences. That was the aggravated form of the break and enter offence, to which the applicant later pleaded guilty. It was on the second day of the trial, after his Honour raised with the Crown its difficulty in establishing the aggravation alleged, namely that the offence took place whilst the applicant was in company, that the Crown obtained approval to have the indictment amended to include a s 112(1) charge, that removing the circumstance of aggravation. The applicant then entered a plea to that lesser offence, as well as to the s 51B offence. 

11Agreed facts were later tendered at the sentencing hearing. The applicant also gave evidence and tendered a psychologist's report. 

The circumstances of the offence

12The evidence established that it was in the early hours of the morning of 21 September 2011 that the applicant drove his co-offenders, Peter Ofo and Daniel Sirol, to a Coles supermarket at Illawong in a white Nissan Pintara. At 3 am, Mr Ofo forced entry through a side fire door of the supermarket, using a crowbar. Mr Sirol entered the store with Mr Ofo. They were carrying a large grey and white doona cover and a crowbar. The applicant remained in the vehicle outside.

13An employee saw the co-offenders, who were both wearing balaclavas, enter the store. He called the police. CCTV footage captured the offenders entering the cigarette kiosk area where Mr Ofo used a crowbar to break the locks on a cabinet and Mr Sirol loaded a large quantity of cigarettes worth about $14,000 into the doona cover. They then left the store by the fire exit door and were driven away by the applicant.

14A few minutes later police sighted the vehicle. They activated lights and sirens and attempted to stop the vehicle. The applicant failed to stop. A 65-minute police pursuit ensued. About six other police vehicles became involved.

15During the pursuit the applicant drove through many suburbs in a manner which his Honour found was dangerous to the public. At times he exceeded the speed limit, on one occasion driving at 165 kilometres per hour. He crossed onto the wrong side of the road and drove through seven red traffic control lights. His Honour found that he drove at grossly excessive speed during this pursuit, during which he had risked the lives and safety of many people.

16The applicant lost control of the vehicle on a gravel road in a cul-de-sac, where he was cornered. He then turned back and rammed into a police vehicle, which was stationary at a one lane bridge. He then reversed and rammed into another police vehicle, which had stopped behind.

17The offenders then attempted to leave the vehicle, but all were arrested, with the applicant still in the driver's seat. Mr Sirol was still wearing the balaclava, gloves and other clothing depicted in CCTV footage. Mr Ofo was still wearing gloves and other clothing depicted in that footage. The applicant was wearing bright pink rubber cleaning gloves on both hands. The doona cover containing approximately 820 packets of cigarettes was found in the vehicle, together with a crowbar. 

18On arrest the applicant took part in a recorded interview. He denied having any knowledge of the break and enter and also denied being the driver of the vehicle during the police pursuit. 

Sentencing remarks

19Berman DCJ noted the circumstances in which the plea had been entered. His Honour considered that the sentence that would otherwise be imposed should be reduced by only a relatively small amount, to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea, given the time it was entered.

20After considering the circumstances of the offences, his Honour turned to consider the applicant's subjective circumstances. He found that the applicant was an extreme example of people appearing before the court, who had had a difficult upbringing. The applicant did not have an opportunity to be brought up with good role models, but was exposed to a lifestyle where committing crimes was commonplace, as was acting violently. He was one of 14 children and was raised by his grandparents, having limited contact with his parents and when he did have such contact, it was not to his benefit. He had been badly beaten by his father and had modelled his life on criminality and violence, believing that committing regular crimes was normal. His Honour accepted that his decision to begin and continue to commit crimes had to be looked at in that light. 

21He found that the applicant had a significant criminal history for someone of 20 years of age. He had spent time in juvenile detention and was only able to remain free in the community for a few months, before committing these offences. This was his first time in adult jail.

22In custody he had been able to complete year 10. He was in a relationship and had children. His daughter being taken away from him by DOCS had been a contributing factor to the commission of these offences, that being a time when he began using heroin, by which he was affected when the offences were committed. 

23His Honour referred to the evidence that the applicant had given, that since he had been in custody, he had come to understand what he had missed out on in life, by spending his time in custody, and what he needed to do, to stay out of trouble. His Honour accepted that he was genuine in what he had said, but observed that things would not be easy for the applicant and that he had a substantial way to go. For those reasons a finding of special circumstances was made. 

24His Honour also accepted that the applicant was a young man when he committed these offences, who did not have the maturity that an adult would. This was taken into account in his favour.

25His Honour also considered the issue of parity, having regard to the remarks of the co-offenders' sentencing judge, Garling DCJ. His Honour concluded that Mr Ofo's criminal history was not quite as bad as that of the applicant. Mr Sirol had no criminal history.

26His Honour noted that the co-offenders both received a 25% discount for an early plea to the aggravated form of the offence which carried a higher maximum penalty of 20 years. His Honour observed:

""I have fashioned a sentence in order to ensure that Mr Ngati does not have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentences I will impose upon him with the sentences imposed upon his co-offenders.""


27His Honour concluded that both of the applicant's offences were serious. He had regard to the applicant's manner of driving, the significant numbers of people he had put at risk, given the length of the police pursuit and the way in which he drove during the pursuit, a pursuit which only came to an end after the applicant trapped himself, after which he still continued to drive dangerously, by ramming two police cars in an attempt to get away. His Honour observed that ""to say that his driving was seriously criminal is something of an understatement.""

28His Honour also found that the break, enter and steal offence was serious. He observed:

""He was part of a scheme which involved significant intrusion to the legitimate property rights of the supermarket in which cigarettes were taken. It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the objective gravity of the crime must be reflected in the sentencing imposed. That fundamental rule is a significant constraint on the leniency that I can offer the offender.""


Ground 1 - failing to give sufficient weight to the applicant's lesser role in the offence

29The applicant submitted that his Honour had failed to give apparent consideration to the applicant's relatively minor role, compared to that of his co-offenders, who had planned and executed the robbery, while he was engaged by them at the last moment, in order to drive the getaway car. It was argued that insufficient consideration had been given by his Honour to the fact that the applicant had not taken any part in the robbery itself, that he had been approached to take part in an offence already planned, and that he had been under the influence of heroin, when he made the decision to participate.

30In my view these submissions must be rejected.

31The degree of an offender's participation is a relevant factor to be taken into consideration on sentencing (see Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 per Gibbs CJ at 609). Such an assessment is to be approached in the way discussed by Woods CJ at CL in R v Goundar [2001] NSWCCA 198; (2001) A Crim R at [28] - [34]:

30 In Breedon NSWCCA 3 December 1992 this Court considered the case of a similar offender who had been the driver of a motor vehicle and who had been charged with the same offence as the present respondent. That offender received the same sentence as the co-offender who had entered the various premises where the offences had been committed and had there threatened the victim with a weapon. 

31 This Court approved the observation of the sentencing judge, when assessing the objective criminality of the offenders, as ""being of the same quality"" upon the basis that they had involved themselves ""in a course of criminal conduct which could be described as a joint criminal enterprise"". 

32 This does not automatically mean that every participant in such an enterprise shares the same degree of objective criminality. The assessment does, however, begin or should begin with the proposition that each intended the crime and each set out to carry it into effect. 

33 On some occasions cause will arise for differentiation between them, for example, if one offender stands out as the obvious ring-leader, or abuses some inside knowledge or connection with the premises to carry the crime into effect, or is the person who actually elects to carry out the threat of violence by using the weapon offensively to cause injury to the victim. 

34 The present case, however, was not such a case since the robbery went according to plan, without violence beyond that contemplated and threatened by the presence of the weapon.""


32This was a similar situation. On the evidence, his Honour's view that the applicant was involved in ""a scheme which involved significant intrusion onto the legitimate property rights of the supermarket in which the cigarettes were taken"" was not only open, but correct. The evidence did not leave open the conclusion that his was a minor role in that scheme. To the contrary, its importance was revealed by the agreement that the applicant was to receive one third of the proceeds of the robbery. The applicant's role was a critical one, albeit it was one which the prosecutor finally accepted should be reflected by the lesser form of the s 112 offence. 

33On the evidence it was open to his Honour to consider that the fact that the applicant was not much involved in planning, did not reveal lesser objective criminality on his part, than that of his co-offenders (see the discussion in R v Cornwall [2007] NSWCCA 359 at [56]). The assistance and encouragement which he provided his co-offenders was plainly considerable. 

34That the applicant was affected by heroin when he decided to participate was also relevant on sentencing, as the applicant submitted. As discussed in Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22; (2010) 199 A Crim R 38 at [26], however:

""There was evidence before the sentencing judge which clearly indicated that it was probable that the applicant's intake of alcohol was the most significant cause of the applicant's behaviour. Intoxication, whether by alcohol or drugs may explain an offence but will ordinarily not mitigate the penalty save where the intoxication is the result of an addiction and the original addiction did not involve a free choice. An offender cannot expect a reduction in sentence merely because they have committed an offence while intoxicated: R v Rosenberger (1994) 76 A Crim R 1.""


35Here the applicant told the psychologist that he was affected by heroin when he decided to participate in the scheme. The extent to which he was affected by that drug also has to be considered. The evidence was that he not only agreed to participate in the scheme, but he agreed to drive the getaway vehicle. He was plainly then capable of driving, with the result that during the police pursuit, he drove at high speed, for a considerable time, over considerable distances, before being cornered by police. It follows that in this case, the applicant's use of heroin can not be accepted as mitigating the seriousness of this offence. 

Ground 2 - His Honour erred in failing to give any weight to the applicant's contrition

36The applicant submitted that his Honour had failed to undertake the important separation of the elements of contrition and the utilitarian value attaching to his plea, when sentencing him. 

37It was conceded that the lateness of his plea, albeit to a lesser charge, and the nature of the proceedings meant that the discount given for the utilitarian value of the plea had to fall towards the lower end of the range. It was also accepted that it was always open to the applicant to have earlier offered to plead guilty to the lesser s 112(1) charge, but it was argued that there was no evidence that such an offer would have been accepted by the Crown, had it been sought. It was submitted that it could be inferred that such a plea would not have been accepted, because that was not offered to the co-offenders. 

38It was further submitted that the question of remorse was different and ought to have been considered separately. In the absence of any reference to a discount being given for contrition, it ought to be inferred that none had been given. In the result, it would be concluded that the sentence imposed on the applicant was too high.

39In my view these submissions must also be rejected.

40It is settled that the utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and that the reason for the delay is irrelevant (see R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; (2006) 160 A Crim R 510 and Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 280). The discount for a plea is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain (see R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 and Ahmad v R [2006] NSWCCA 177).

41Further, the utilitarian discount does not have regard to the strength of the prosecution case (see R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225; (2004) 41 MVR 40), but the extent to which leniency can be afforded on the basis of remorse, does. Consideration must also be given to whether a plea resulted from a recognition of the inevitable (see R v Winchester (1992) 58 A Crim R 345). 

42These are all relevant considerations in this case. 

43While his Honour did not specify the precise amount of the discount which the applicant received for his plea, the conclusion that the sentence could only be reduced by a relatively small amount, given its limited utilitarian value, was plainly correct. Otherwise, given the sentence actually imposed, the inference that proper regard was not paid by his Honour to the issue of remorse, may not be drawn. 

44Remorse is a mitigating factor available to be taken into account in sentencing under s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, only in particular circumstances. It provides:

""(i) the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:

(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and

(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)""


45No separate discount is given for any expression of remorse. It is rather one of a number of mitigating factors which may taken into account in the general synthesis involved in the overall sentencing exercise (see R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1).

46The applicant was arrested with the two co-offenders, after a long, dangerous police chase. They both entered early pleas to the aggravated version of the s 112 offence. The applicant defended that charge and the s51B(1) charge. It was always open to the applicant to have offered to plead guilty to the lesser charge, as his Honour observed. Instead, he defended both charges.

47Given the strength of the Crown case, conviction on the driving charge was always inevitable. In the circumstances, a plea to that offence and an offer to plead to a s 112(1) offence could have been made at an earlier time than here emerged. The hearing before the jury commenced on 1 August 2012. The plea was entered to the lesser charge the following day. 

48It follows that in the circumstances, little weight could be given to the remorse which the applicant finally expressed, by entry of the plea to the offence the subject of this appeal. 

49The applicant was interviewed by the psychologist in September. The sentencing hearing took place on 5 October. The applicant gave evidence and the psychologist's report was tendered. 

50The applicant himself then gave no evidence as to his remorse. Outlined in the psychologist's report was an account which the applicant had given, that at the time of the offence he was having difficulty functioning, because of his daily heroin use. He was affected by heroin when he decided to participate in the offence. He became involved as the result of the offer of a 'three way split', in order to finance his purchase of more drugs.

51The report referred to the applicant expressing regret for his offending. The psychologist considered this evidenced some maturity and a sense of empathy for his offending behaviour, which according to the applicant, he did not have following earlier offences. In his evidence on sentencing the applicant confirmed the accuracy of the account which he gave to psychologist. He was not cross-examined as to this aspect of the report. 

52On all this evidence it was open to his Honour to accept that remorse had been demonstrated. Given the lenient sentence which his Honour imposed, which he explained was constrained by the need to impose a sentence which reflected the objective gravity of this serious offence, it must be inferred that his Honour took proper account of all available mitigating matters, including remorse.

Ground 4 - The sentence was manifestly excessive

53The applicant's case was that the sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust, so as to warrant this Court's intervention.

54It was submitted that relevant sentencing statistics showed that the sentence fell towards the upper end of the range for s 112(1) offences, but those imposed on the co-offenders fell within the middle of the range for s 112(2) offences. Comparative cases demonstrated that the applicant was dealt with more harshly than offenders in similar cases, given that his offending did not fall into the worst category, but towards the bottom of the range. It was also relevant that it was an offence which could properly have been dealt with in the Local Court.

55I am satisfied that these submissions must be rejected. 

56Before the applicant could be re-sentenced, a basis for the opinion that some other sentence than that imposed is warranted in law and should have been passed, must be established (see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79]). Absent demonstrated error, the Court of Criminal Appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge, merely because it would have exercised the sentencing discretion in a different way to that which the sentencing Judge exercised that discretion (see Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at [15]).

57Further, before it could be established that the sentence was manifestly excessive, the applicant would have to establish that it was unreasonable or plainly unjust (see Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325). That was not established.

58That the s 112(1) offence to which the applicant entered the plea on the second day of his trial on the s 112(2) offence could have been dealt with in the Local Court, was not relied on at the sentencing hearing. It is only in rare circumstances that a factor which might operate in mitigation of penalty, which the material led on sentencing reveals may have been overlooked by defence counsel and the sentencing judge, can be raised for the first time on appeal. Further, as also discussed in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [83]:

""It is difficult to see how the possibility of summary disposal lies in this category. In reality, as will be seen, the possibility of summary disposal as a mitigating factor is to be confined to a rare and exceptional set of circumstances where the offender is being sentenced in the District Court for an offence which may be seen as a clear summary offence which ought otherwise have been prosecuted in the Local Court. In such circumstances, it might be thought that the argument is so obvious that defence counsel at first instance will advance a submission in the District Court to that effect. If that does not occur, then this may be a very practical barometer as to whether such an argument was realistically available in the circumstances of the case in the first place.""


59Likewise in this case, given the nature and seriousness of the applicant's offence, that it ought to have been prosecuted in the Local Court was an argument which was not realistically available to the applicant, particularly when the circumstances in which he came to be sentenced for the s 112(1) offence in the District Court are considered. 

60Neither the sentencing remarks nor the sentence imposed establish that his Honour took into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for the more serious offence, for which the applicant's co-offenders were sentenced. The case advanced on appeal overlooked the applicant's own explanation of his role in the offenders' scheme, for which the offenders agreed that he would take a one third share of the proceeds of the robbery. 

61It is also relevant that the applicant agreed to participate, so that he could fund his further drug taking. In arriving at this sentence his Honour was obliged to consider all of the applicant's conduct relevant to the offence to which he had entered his plea. His Honour was sentencing the applicant in circumstances where he had committed his offence while at liberty on bail. That was an aggravating factor which had to be taken into account in the sentence imposed on the applicant, which was not present in the case if his co-offenders (see s 21A(2)(j) of the 1999 Act).

62On the evidence the conclusion that the co-offenders' offences fell within the mid-range, while that of the applicant fell into the bottom of the range of their respective offending, was simply not open. The comparative cases on which the applicant relied certainly did not support that conclusion. The sentences imposed in those cases do not establish that the sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive.

Ground 3 - His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of parity

63The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed did not have necessary regard to the co-offenders' conviction of the more serious s 112(2) offence, which carried a maximum term of 20 years, rather than 14. It was argued that his Honour did not distinguish sufficiently between the offences, given his conclusion that the s 112(1) offence was a 'slightly less serious version' of the offence and in concluding that the applicant had been part of 'the scheme'.

64It was also submitted that his Honour had failed to give consideration to the applicant's relatively minor role in the offence, compared to that of his two co-offenders. It was the other two offenders who had planned and executed the robbery and the applicant who had been engaged by them at the last moment, to drive the getaway car. In dealing with parity, his Honour had not distinguished their roles as he ought to have.

65In the result no or insufficient weight had been given to the fact that the applicant took no part in the robbery itself, did not provide the vehicle, was not involved in the planning, was approached by the co-offenders to take part in the scheme once it was already planned and was under the influence of heroin, when he made the decision on that day to assist. 

66It was also submitted that if his Honour had allowed only a 10% discount for the plea, the starting point for this sentence must have been a term of some 46 months, while that for the co-offender Mr Sirol was 48 months and the co-offender Mr Ofo 39 months. They were respectively aged 19, 37 and 27 years. Both Mr Ofo and the applicant were found to have had extensive criminal histories, Mr Ofo's not quite as bad as that of the offender. There was, however, it was submitted, little to distinguish between them. Nor had account been taken of the fact that Mr Ofo had been the product of a sound upbringing, whereas the applicant was the product of an abusive background, with little opportunity to escape from modelled behaviour of criminality and violence.

67In the result it was submitted that the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance at the sentence imposed.

68In my view this ground of appeal has also not been established.

69A complaint as to parity accepts that the sentence imposed was otherwise appropriate (see England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [22]; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [251]). It is for the applicant to demonstrate that the sentence imposed on him has left him with a justifiable sense of grievance.

70In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462, French CJ, Crennan And Kiefel JJ observed at [31]:

""Because appeals are creatures of statute, the parity principle in appeals against sentence arises in a statutory context. The jurisdictions to entertain such appeals, conferred by statutes on courts of criminal appeal in Australia, are supported by powers to increase or reduce sentences affected by appealable error. In the exercise of those powers in appeals by convicted persons, and subject to the applicable sentencing statutes, a court may ""reduce a sentence not in itself manifestly excessive in order to avoid a marked disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender.""[Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609-610 per Gibbs CJ] The exercise of the statutory discretion is informed by the common law norm. Gibbs CJ said in Lowe v The Queen [(1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610]: ""the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done."" The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity [Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 323 per Gummow J; at 338 per Kirby J]. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise [Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609 per Gibbs CJ].""


71When sentencing the applicant, his Honour considered the sentences imposed on the co-offenders. The s 112(2) offence to which they entered their pleas carries a higher maximum penalty than the offence for which the offender was being sentenced, of 20 rather than 14 years. It also attracts a standard non-parole period of 5 years. Both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period had to be taken into account, when the co-offenders were being sentenced. 

72In considering parity as between the co-offenders, Garling DCJ considered that they had an equal part in their serious offences. He had regard to the planning involved, that the offence was committed for financial gain, that they fled the scene and that there was an hour-long pursuit. In the result, his Honour considered that both general and specific deterrence were required to be given attention on sentencing. He observed that the difference between them was that Mr Sirol had no criminal record. (Mr Ofo's record was considered by Berman DCJ to be similar to that of the applicant.) Special circumstances were found in both cases.

73Garling JDCJ concluded that no sentence other than imprisonment for a term in excess of 2 years was warranted in each case. The starting point for Mr Sirol's sentence was 3 years and 3 months, reduced by 25% to result in a non-parole period of 1 year and 2 months and a total term of 2 years and 5 months. The starting point for Mr Ofo was 4 years, reduced by 25% to result in a non-parole period of 2 years and a total term of 3 years. 

74In dealing with the question of parity when sentencing the applicant, his Honour also took account of the fact that the co-offenders had pleaded guilty to the aggravated from of the s 112 offence, receiving a 25% discount for their plea, as well as their respective personal circumstances, which he referred to. 

75Having considered the resulting sentences imposed on the co-offenders, Berman DCJ sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months, 4 months of which was concurrent with the 1 year fixed term for the police pursuit offence. The total term for the offence was 3 years and 6 months, against the maximum penalty of 14 years.

76In arriving at that sentence, his Honour did not indicate the amount of the discount which he gave the applicant for his very late plea. He was not obliged to do so (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 419 [160].) That it was as high as 10%, as was submitted for the applicant, seems unlikely in the circumstances. 

77Even if it were, the end result of the sentencing exercise was a lenient one, given that only 14 months of the non-parole period for the s 112(1) offence was referable to this offence alone, 4 months being made concurrent with the sentence for the s 51B(1) offence. 

78His Honour said he had arrived at this result, having in mind the principle of parity. I can see no error in the conclusion so reached. In my view the sentences imposed do not show either unjustifiable disparity, or an objective basis for any justifiable sense of grievance on the applicant's part.

79Unjustifiable disparity is an infringement of the equal justice principle involving appellable error. Even if, contrary to the view I have reached, it were concluded that such an error had occurred, that would not necessarily lead to this appeal being allowed (see Green at [32]). That is because, as was there explained at [33]:

""There is a question whether a sentence which would otherwise be appropriate can be reduced on the ground of disparity to a level which, had there been no disparity, would be regarded as erroneously lenient. In Lowe that question was answered explicitly in the affirmative by Mason J[(1984) 154 CLR 606 at 613-614] and less explicitly but to like effect by Dawson J, with whom Wilson J agreed[(1984) 154 CLR 606 at 623 per Dawson J, Wilson J agreeing at 616. And see R v Diamond (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 18 February 1993) per Hunt CJ at CL, James J agreeing, which so interpreted the observation by Dawson J]. It has also been answered in the affirmative in a number of cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales[R v Tisalandis [1982] 2 NSWLR 430 at 435 per Street CJ; R v Anastasio (unreported, 21 November 1986) at 3; R v Smith (unreported, 5 December 1986); R v Draper (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 12 December 1986) at 5 per Street CJ, Hunt and Wood JJ agreeing at 5; R v Diamond (unreported, Court
of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 18 February 1993) at 5 per Hunt CJ at CL, James J agreeing at 11; R v Maslen (1995) 79 A Crim R 199 at 207-208 per Hunt CJ at CL, Sully and Smart JJ agreeing at 212.]. On the other hand, as Simpson J correctly pointed out in R v Steele [Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 17 April 1997 at 8-11, Sheller JA and Grove J agreeing. See also Pecora v The Queen [1980] VR 499 at 503; R v MacGowan (1986) 42 SASR 580 at 583 per King CJ, Mohr and von Doussa JJ agreeing at 584; R v Cox (1991) 55 A Crim R 396 at 401 per Thomas J; R v
Reardon (1996) 89 A Crim R 180 at 182 per Gleeson CJ; at 183 per Sully J; cf at 191 per R S Hulme J; R v Djukic [2001] VSCA 226 at [29]-[30] per Vincent JA, Brooking and Phillips JJA agreeing at [1] and [2]; Newburn v The Queen [2004] WASCA 108 at [44] per E M Heenan J, Templeman J agreeing at [1]; R v Hildebrandt (2008) 187 A Crim R 42 at 49-52 [51]-[65] per Dodds-Streeton JA,
Ashley JA and Lasry A-JA agreeing at 43 [1] and 56 [93]], the existence of a discretion, where unjustified disparity is shown, to reduce a co-offender's sentence to one which is inadequate does not amount to an obligation to do so. Certainly, the discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal to reduce a sentence to a less than adequate level would not require it to consider reducing the sentence to a level which would be, as Street CJ put it in R v Draper, ""an affront to the proper administration of justice."" [ R v Draper (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 12 December 1986) at 5 per Street CJ, Hunt and Wood JJ agreeing at 5; R v Diamond (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 18 February 1993) at 5-6 per Hunt CJ at CL, James J agreeing at 11; R v McIvor (2002) 136 A Crim R 366 at 371 [10] per Heydon JA, Levine J and Carruthers A-J agreeing at 372 [12] and [13]] Moreover, if the relevant sentencing legislation, on its proper construction, does not permit an inadequate sentence to be imposed, there can be no discretion on appeal to impose one [That proposition seems to have been implicit in the construction placed on s 6(1) of the Sentencing Act 1995 (WA) by Murray J in Goddard v The Queen (1999) 21 WAR 541 at 562 [61]. That sub-section required that ""a sentence imposed on an offender must be commensurate with the seriousness of the offence""]. Whether or not the discretion to reduce a sentence to an inadequate level is available, marked and unjustified disparity may be mitigated by reduction of the sentence appealed against to a level which, although lower, is still within the range of appropriate sentences.""


80In this case the applicant has already received a lenient sentence for his serious offence. When it is considered that 4 months of the non-parole period imposed for this offence is to be served concurrently with the non-parole period fixed for the s 51A offence, any further reduction of his sentence would plainly result in an inadequate sentence for this offence. It follows that even if it were concluded that an objective basis for a justifiable sense of grievance had been established, any reduction in the sentence imposed could not be granted. 

Orders

81The orders I would propose are:

1. Leave to appeal in relation to grounds 1 and 2 refused.

2. Leave to appeal in relation to grounds 3 and 4 granted.

3. Appeal dismissed.

		30 August 2013",2013-08-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706251,R v Veronica Eliana SALAS-COLLARD [2013] NSWSC 1188,"Judgment

Introduction

1On 12 April 2013, following a trial the offender, Veronica Eliana Salas-Collard, was found guilty of being an accessory after the fact to murder, an offence under s 349(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. No standard non-parole period applies to this offence. The offender has asked the Court to take into account (and I do so) under a Form 1 another charge of being an accessory after the fact, in this case, to an offence of aggravated breaking and entering which, under the applicable section of the Crimes Act renders the offender liable to imprisonment for a maximum of 5 years. Again, such an offence is not one carrying a standard non-parole period. Each offence was allegedly committed between 1 December 2010 and 16 December 2010 and, essentially, involved assisting her then boyfriend (aged 17 at the time) to evade police, he having committed the offences in company with another young man. It is important to note that it is, and could not be, suggested that the offender was in any way at all involved in either the murder or the aggravated breaking and entering. However, it is of course necessary to briefly describe these offences.

Background 

2During the night of 30 November 2010 Corrie Loveridge (then aged 18) and AB (aged 17) had been with the offender and a number of others at an address in St Marys for some hours drinking and using drugs. Loveridge, with a knife, and AB, left together and walked to a nearby house where resided alone, as Loveridge knew, an elderly woman, Mrs Parrelli. The pair entered the house. Wakened by the noise they made Mrs Parelli, then in bed, got up, saw the back door was open and went to close it. She then saw Loveridge and AB inside the house. Loveridge grabbed the walking stick which she was holding at the time and hit her several times over the head and body with sufficient force to break the stick, knocking her to the ground. Loveridge and AB threatened Ms Parrelli and demanded money. Ultimately they took a television set and a wristwatch from the house, Loveridge dropping the knife on the driveway as they fled. Loveridge and AB carried the television back to the house from which they had come. Mrs Parrelli was taken to hospital by ambulance and found to have suffered serious bruising to her head, face and arm, remaining in hospital for some 22 days. 

3When Loveridge and AB returned, they told the offender, in substance, that they had just committed a break and enter at the home of an elderly woman whom Loveridge had punched and hit with her walking stick on the head several times. They also said they had come back with a watch. 

4The murder in question occurred when Loveridge and AB left the premises about two hours or so later and were on their way back from a nearby service station where they had withdrawn cash and purchased some food. They were armed with kitchen knives. They came across three young men, including the victim Alan Ray Gordon who was 17 years old. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that after Loveridge attacked one of the young men with a knife, he and another fled to get help but Mr Gordon did not manage to get away. He was set on by Loveridge and AB who punched, kicked and stabbed him many times, causing very serious injuries, leaving when he was unconscious and bleeding to death. 

The facts of the offence 

5The pair ran back to the house where other occupants were still awake, whom they told of their attack. Essentially, the evidence relied on by the Crown comes from the offender's account told to police of her movements with AB after he returned with Loveridge from the attack. The offender said that she was sleeping and was awakened by their return. She said they were taking their clothes off putting them in a backpack. They then took her to an intersection, virtually across the road from where they told her the body lay but she could not see it. Whilst they were on their way, they told her briefly, in effect, that they thought they had killed him but she was not clear why they wanted her to go back with them and thought that they wanted her to see if he was alive or not. She said that police were there with a spotlight, so they remained concealed. Loveridge walked her back to the house. 

6It is from this point that the actions of the offender rendered her liable to the offence of which she has been convicted. Both concern only what she did by way of assisting AB. It is not suggested that, in any way, she assisted Loveridge to evade the police. So far as assisting goes, merely remaining in the company of AB was, rightly, not put forward by the Crown as amounting to assisting him. 

7Some hours later, about 10.30am in the morning, she and AB caught a taxi together, with a sports bag which contained bloody clothes and at least one of the knives, although this was not said to be known to the offender. They first went to the house of AB's sister and her boyfriend where they stayed for several days. It is not suggested that the offender had anything to do with this part of AB's attempt to abscond. The offender said that, at this time, she still did not believe that AB was telling the truth about killing someone. She had not actually seen the victim and said that she had not seen any blood. But everyone else told her that he had committed the murder. 

8I accept that it is likely that the offender was aware of sufficient matters surrounding the killing of Mr Gordon at some time during their stay with AB's sister but there was uncertainty as to her presence during all of the conversations between AB, his sister and his sister's boyfriend, when undoubtedly sufficient of the details establishing his guilt of murder were disclosed. She was also drowsy during this period and nodding off to sleep. She told police that whilst they were still at AB's sister's place they had looked at news reports on the internet about the attack on the victim, who had died on the way to hospital. At this point, although any reasonable person, I think, would have realised that AB had been involved in a killing, I think there is a reasonable possibility that the offender did not appreciate that he had committed murder. At the same time, however, she was aware that he had committed a very serious criminal offence and, despite this, she was prepared to assist him to avoid arrest by arranging for accommodation at her cousin's place, where the pair stayed for two days.

9The offender and AB then went to her cousin's place, where her baby son was. At this point the offender still maintained that, although she had been told that AB had killed a boy, she still could not believe it. Whilst they were staying with her cousin, AB went out and she met him at a nearby sports oval. AB told her, ""We've got to, we've got to get out of here, we've got to go"" and told the offender, in effect, that he and Loveridge had killed the victim, describing briefly to her what had happened with details that informed the offender that there had been a fight involving a number of people including AB and Loveridge and that a boy had died from several stab wounds inflicted by one or other or both of Loveridge and AB in circumstances amounting to murder.

10The couple moved after two days to a home unit at Miller where a friend of the offender lived and was, it appears, prepared to let them stay. Quite what he was told or knew is not known and is irrelevant for present purposes. It is clear that the offender took AB to Miller with her because he told her they needed to move from where they were staying because of the presence of police, whom he thought were in the area. She accepted that the reason for taking him to Miller was to help him avoid police. On 16 December 2010 AB was arrested outside the home unit where they had been staying. 

11Overall, the offender's assistance of AB to avoid police amounted to taking him to her cousin's home and then onto the Miller unit, all in all covering a period of perhaps three days or so, enabling him to remain at large for about two weeks. There is insufficient evidence as to what transpired when they came to the Miller address and I do not find beyond reasonable doubt that her assistance extended beyond finding that address and accompanying him there, and staying with him and her son and, perhaps, (but the evidence does not go so far) with her friend who was the occupier. 

12The defence case, which depended upon evidence of AB's propensity for violence and the offender's psychological vulnerability, was that the jury could not be satisfied that the offender had assisted AB as a voluntary act but because her will was overborne by AB. The prosecution case in this respect was that, the offender had told police, in effect, that AB had never made any threats that he would hurt her if she were to go to the police and indeed she said that he had never been violent towards her. In short, she was not and did not feel threatened. The Crown also pointed out at least one and possibly more opportunities when, if she were so minded, she could have gone to the police and sought protection. In the result, of course, the jury must have accepted the Crown case on either of these bases. In my view, whilst the offender did not assist him because she was in fear of him, such was her relationship that it did not occur to her that she should act independently and not to what he asked her to do. 

The offender's mental state

13Dr Olav Nielssen was called in the defence case during the trial to give evidence about the offender's psychiatric condition at the relevant time. This evidence was relied on for the purpose of sentence. The offender has a strong family history of mental illness involving an uncle, two cousins and her mother. She, herself, has been involved with mental health units since she was 13, both for long and short admissions, with varying diagnoses. Following her arrest she had attempted suicide, requiring admission to hospital. Medical records show a prescription of medication for bipolar mood disorder and depression, this latter apparently involving chronic suicidal thoughts, exacerbated by early onset substance abuse, mainly cannabis, in the context of significant trauma, neglect and abuse in childhood and adolescence. 

14Following her arrest on 16 December 2010 and consequential imprisonment until her release on bail on 23 December 2010 the offender was treated by Justice Health following self-reporting of hallucinations and paranoia which, on her release, required medication, perhaps indicative of a developing psychotic illness. At the time of the offence, the doctor thought it to be reasonably well established that she suffered from a personality disorder involving pervasive maladaptive personality traits having a significant impact on her social performance as evidenced by her frequent admissions to hospital with deliberate self-harm, severe mood swings and some severe depression and self-defeating behaviour including, for example, in forming abusive relationships (some six months before her arrest she had been stabbed in the hand by her previous partner, causing permanent injury). 

15Dr Nielssen thought that the offender probably had an underlying or emerging schizophrenic illness combined with an anxiety disorder. These mental characteristics would have affected her judgment, contributing to poor and self-defeating decision-making. At the same time, the doctor noted that there was no empirical signs of any mental illness such as disorganised thinking or appearing distracted, demonstrated during her interview with police. For myself, although I thought she did not appreciate the serious position in which she found herself and her account was in some respect disorganised, her responses and general demeanour appeared reasonably normal. Whatever the detailed character of any diagnosis might be, I do not doubt that the offender was mentally and emotionally fragile, immature for her age and in thrall to AB.

16This evidence is relevant both to the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective features to be taken into account on sentence.

Subjective features

17The offender was 19 years of age as at the date of the offence with a conviction for shoplifting and contravening an apprehended violence order for which no penalty was imposed. A pre-sentence report was tendered giving details of her very compromised upbringing but also a good and supportive relationship with her mother and stepfather. She gave birth to her first child when she was but 16 years of age and fell pregnant again after these offences, having a second child in July of this year, the father of the child being about 30 years older than the offender but, it appears, a very significant support for her. The Probation and Parole officer thought that the offender appeared to be genuinely sorry about her involvement but, at the same time, (as I understand the officer) she felt powerless in the situation due to her own fears and previous experiences of violence and abuse. The offender was assessed as unlikely to require or benefit from supervision by the Probation and Parole Service for the reason that her mental health needs would be best addressed by community based mental health services. She was also unsuitable for a community service order because of her unstable mental health, the continuing effects of her hand injury and, at the time of the report, her pregnancy. I accept that she has now disassociated herself entirely from AB and, indeed, this occurred shortly after his arrest although there were communications between them after that date, involving serious threats made by AB because he thought she was being unfaithful to him.

18The offender now has the care of two children. She is supported by her mother and stepfather and the father of her newborn. I am satisfied that she is remorseful and that it is most unlikely that she will commit an offence of this kind or this seriousness again. 

Assessment

19An offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder is, obviously, serious, as is demonstrated by the maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years. As Thomas J stated in R v Hawken (1986) 27 A Crim R 32 at 38 - 

""... It is in the interests of the community that murderers should be completely isolated from support and deprived of assistance and that such crimes be not covered up.""

It is evident, however, that the offence can be committed in a wide range of varying circumstances, giving rise to sentences of full time imprisonment, periodic detention, release on entry to a good behaviour bond and suspension. Overall, the cases decided in this Court are far to few to suggest any range although it is clear that a non-custodial disposition is appropriate in some cases. If I may say so, Buddin J in R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104, set out (at paras [15] to [24]) a useful summary of a number of significant judgments of this Court concerning this offence, which I do not need to repeat here.

Conclusion

20In this case, the assistance rendered by the offender was over a relatively short period at the insistence of AB and whilst she was compromised by her mental condition and though not overborne to the extent of being under duress, was in a situation where I am satisfied it did not occur to her that she could or should decline to assist him as he demanded. In all the circumstances I am not satisfied that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate: see s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

21Accordingly, I order the offender to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of two years subject to the condition that, during the term of the bond the offender will be of good behaviour and will appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond.

		30 August 2013",2013-08-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706253,Wienand v R [2013] NSWCCA 202,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
Offence and sentence
The applicant pleaded guilty to one offence of supply a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years. The amount was 1,848.6 grams.

2On 10 August 2012 the applicant was sentenced by Sorby DCJ to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months commencing 2 December 2010 and expiring 1 June 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months, expiring 1 December 2018.

3The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following grounds:

a. The sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive.
b. The sentence imposed started from a notional starting point that was too high.
c. The sentence imposed caused the applicant to have a justifiable sense of grievance when the sentence is compared to the sentence imposed on Hill, his co-offender.

Factual Background

4The facts of the offending were set out in an Agreed Statement of Facts which became part of Exhibit ""A"" in the sentence proceedings. The Crown and defence each supplied a summary of facts. The following were the facts found by the primary judge.

5In May 2010 NSW Police commenced a controlled operation investigating the criminal offending of Mr Paul Robinson (Robinson). As part of the operation an authorised participant (AP), who was a previous criminal associate of Robinson, was authorised to buy prohibited drugs from Robinson. The controlled operation utilised telephone intercepts, listening devices and surveillance.

6In late October 2010 the AP made contact with Robinson. On 26 October 2010 the AP introduced an undercover police officer (UCO) with the intention that the UCO would purchase prohibited drugs directly from Robinson. During the phone call Robinson advised the UCO that he supplied the drugs from someone who sourced them from another person.

7The head of the supply chain was an accused person ""AM"". He would hand the drugs to the applicant, who would then deliver them to the co-offender, Hill, at his place of business where Robinson went to collect them to supply to the UCO. This place of business was known as ""Razorback Inflatable Boats"".

8The first supply was on 4 November 2010. On that occasion Hill met the applicant at his private residence the day before ""to make sure that you know everything is all right"". The applicant, Hill and Robinson then attended Razorback Inflatable Boats at about 6.10pm. 

9The UCO remained outside the premises during the transaction. Robinson supplied the drugs to the UCO while Hill and the applicant remained inside the premises. Five minutes after the transaction, the applicant left the premises. The actual supply by Robinson to the UCO was captured on a listening device and video surveillance. The drugs were seized by the police and the UCO immediately thereafter. A DAL certificate confirmed that the drugs comprised 249 grams of methylamphetamine, 978 tablets at 3.5 percent purity.

10The next supply was on 11 November 2010. On this day, Hill told the applicant by telephone that the money would be dropped off that day. The applicant replied ""same as last week,"" and Hill replied ""yes"". They then arranged for the drugs to be dropped off at 6pm with Hill telling the applicant that he could just wait in the car ""so he doesn't see you"". There was a further telephone conversation in which those arrangements were confirmed.

11At 3pm the applicant had a telephone conversation with AM who told him that he was on his way. The UCO was supplied with methylamphetamine by Robinson at 6.04pm in exchange for $14,000 outside the Razorback premises. Hill remained inside the premises during the transaction. The applicant was not present. At 6.45pm the applicant had another telephone conversation with AM to organise a meeting place to ""pick up my pay"". 

12The actual supply by Robinson to the UCO was captured by a listening device and video surveillance. The drugs were seized by the police from the UCO immediately afterwards. A DAL certificate confirmed that the drugs comprised 248.6 grams of methylamphetamine, 995 tablets at 3 percent purity.

13The next supply was on 18 November 2010. On that occasion, at 4.43pm the applicant had a telephone conversation with AM. The applicant told him that he was approaching Dolls Point. He picked up the methylamphetamine from AM shortly thereafter. At 5.27pm the applicant had a telephone conversation with Hill and told him that he would be there at 6.10pm. The applicant thereafter attended the Razorback premises where he delivered the methylamphetamine to Hill. Robinson and the UCO arrived shortly afterwards. Robinson supplied the drugs to the UCO.

14At 7.56pm the applicant had a telephone conversation with AM in which he asked where he was. Shortly thereafter, the applicant was observed handing over a parcel to AM. The actual supply by Robinson to the UCO was captured on a listening device and video surveillance. A DAL certificate confirmed that the drugs comprised a total of 486 grams of methylamphetamine at 4 percent purity, with 958 tablets in one bag and 951 tablets in another bag.

15The fourth supply was on 2 December 2010. On 23 November 2010 the applicant and Hill discussed by telephone the next supply. On 24 November 2010, the applicant exchanged text messages with AM. The two agreed to reduce the sale price to $8.50 per pill in exchange for supplies of 5,000 every week until Christmas. On 24 November 2010 the applicant and Hill discussed by telephone the applicant's supply of the tablets to Hill for $10 who would on-supply to Robinson for $10.50. 

16On 1 December 2010, text messages were exchanged between the applicant and AM, organising a supply for the following day. On 2 December 2010 text messages were exchanged between the applicant and AM, organising a supply for the following day at 3pm. At 2.55pm the applicant telephoned and said that he was lost. At 2.56pm the applicant met AM in the foyer of the building where AM lived. At 3.19pm the applicant left that building alone, holding a green bag which was earlier seen to be held by AM. The applicant was arrested shortly thereafter with 864 grams of methylamphetamine. This consisted of 3,105 tablets at 35 percent purity and 88 grams of powder at 7 percent purity.

Proceedings before primary judge

17A number of documents were before the primary judge, including his remarks on sentence in relation to Hill, whom he had sentenced on 18 November 2011. 

18A report of a psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro, was tendered on behalf of the applicant. This report stated that the applicant was born in 1965 in South Africa. He came to Australia with his family when he was aged 12. He completed his school certificate and did two years of a panel beating course before joining the Army where he completed his apprenticeship as a panel beater. He ran his own panel beating business for six years from the age of 30. He went out of business, as a result of psychiatric problems due to his substance abuse, long working hours and the breakdown of his marriage. He had four children from the marriage. Thereafter, he had various jobs in the smash repair industry until his arrest in 2010.

19The applicant told the psychologist that he had started smoking cannabis at the age of 17 and using amphetamines at the age of 19. This had continued until the time of his arrest. He had also abused ecstasy and cocaine.

20His Honour noted that the applicant did not give evidence, or express any remorse for his behaviour, although he did tell the psychologist that he was remorseful. His Honour was prepared to accept that the applicant was genuinely remorseful because of testimonials tendered on his behalf. His Honour found special circumstances because of the applicant's need for ongoing rehabilitation.

21The applicant had only minor convictions on his record and none for drug use or supply. The most serious offences concerned contravening apprehended violence orders. His Honour found ""his general good character is attested to by letters tendered on his behalf ... the offender's character is a relevant factor in the offender's rehabilitation prospects"". 

22Because the applicant pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, he was given a 25 percent discount for the utilitarian value of his plea. His Honour found that the offence committed by the applicant ""was both for his drug problem and for profit"". His Honour considered that drug supply for profit was an aggravating factor.

23In relation to the offence, his Honour said:

""These facts reveal an objectively serious offence. The amounts of the drug were significant, well above the thousand-gram threshold. If it had made its way into the community, rather than to the UCO, it would have been capable of doing a great deal of harm, particularly among the young. General deterrence is particularly important in a sentencing exercise, to send a clear message to like minded individuals in the community that such activities will not be tolerated. The role of this offender, as in any such offence, is an important issue going to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence.

The offender was not the principal - that role could be, on the facts, the person AM from whom the offender obtained the drugs, on each occasion before supplying them to Hill and Robinson and ultimately to the undercover officer known as UCO. Neither Robinson nor Hill dealt with AM. It was only through this offender and this placed this offender close to the source of the drugs, higher up the hierarchy, although in supplies 1, 2 and 3 he only delivers the drugs from AM to Hill and Robinson.

In the fourth deal he is involved in price negotiation, an indicator of a greater role in the supply chain than that of a mere courier. He holds discussions with someone on the end of a telephone as to price and quantity, and then negotiates with Hill and Robinson. The purity of the drugs however was relatively low. This offence is objectively serious, and in my view of a similar level of seriousness to that of the offender Hill."" (ROS 5)

24The primary judge was conscious of the principle of parity between the applicant and Hill. In that regard, he summarised the relevant factors as follows:

(i) Both were involved in the same four transactions and with the same amount of drugs.

(ii) Hill was given a 50 percent discount for his plea of guilty in the Local Court and his assistance to authorities was described as being ""of great importance"".

(iii) The objective seriousness of Hills's offending was found to be ""below, but not far below the mid range of objective seriousness of such offences.""

(iv) There was a finding of special circumstances for Mr Hill.

(v) Hill had no criminal history and was found to be of good character, for his community work and research on behalf of the community.

(vi) Hill was the middle man between the applicant and Robinson. The applicant acted as a middle man between the principal supplier AM and Hill.

(vii) AM was head of a supply chain and this applicant had direct dealings with him as opposed to Hill.

(viii) This applicant was the intermediary between the principal AM and Hill, and therefore higher within the drug hierarchy.

(ix) Hill received no financial benefit from the first two transactions. For the third transaction, he received $1,000 and had anticipated a profit of $1,500 for the fourth transaction.

(x) Following the second transaction, the applicant spoke with AM and discussed a meeting place to ""pick up my pay"" indicating some financial remuneration for that transaction. The applicant anticipated a profit of $3,500 for the last transaction which was significantly greater than the $1,500 Hill had just received for that transaction.

25It should be noted that Hill was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years, with a balance of term of 2 years. On appeal to this Court, that sentence was reduced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 1 year. The basis for the reduction in the sentence was the opinion of the Court that the sentencing judge had given insufficient weight to Hill's strong subjective case. In that matter: Hill v R [2012] NSWCCA 265, Harrison J (with whom Simpson and Adamson JJ agreed) said:

""6 His Honour also referred to the fact that the applicant had either been, or at least felt that he had been, threatened by Robinson and Wienand. The extent if at all to which his Honour took account of this material as evidence of some form of coercion is unclear. It seems on balance likely that his Honour did take that material into account. 

...

24 There is in my view much to be said for the contention that the sentence imposed upon the applicant is incongruously at odds with the strong subjective case. Nowhere is this more apparent than from the terms of the applicant's own letter to his Honour for sentencing purposes. That letter chronicles a frightening and rapid descent into an unpredictable involvement with his co-accused, wholly foreign to the life he had lived to that point. He put the safety of himself and his family at risk for no good purpose and for little tangible or other reward or benefit.

...

27 I consider this applicant to have a very strong subjective case, both with respect to his position before the offences were committed and since he has been charged. It seems to me that his Honour has failed in his analysis to incorporate some matters particularly affecting the applicant, and has thereby erroneously given inadequate and correspondingly improper consideration to his subjective case. This has in my view resulted in a failure to take into account some material consideration in the way explained in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-5.""

THE APPEAL
a. The sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive.
b. The sentence imposed started from a notional starting point that was too high.

26The applicant dealt with these two grounds of appeal together. It is convenient to follow the same approach. 

27The applicant submitted that the standard non-parole period played a significant role in the calculation of the sentence in such a way as to give rise to the error identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. To support that proposition, the applicant relied upon the assessment of objective seriousness which the primary judge made when sentencing Hill. There his Honour assessed the offence as ""below but not far below the mid-range of objective seriousness for such offences"". The applicant submitted that because his Honour said in relation to the applicant ""this offence is objectively serious and in my view, of a similar level of seriousness to that of the offender Hill"", he had incorporated the same erroneous concept into his assessment of the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending. As a result, the applicant submitted that the starting point for the sentence imposed on him was too high.

Consideration

28In oral submissions, these grounds of appeal were but faintly pressed. In order to make out the first ground of appeal, i.e., that the sentence is manifestly excessive, it was necessary to persuade this Court that the sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v R [2008] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325. No reason was put forward as to why the sentence imposed on the applicant was unreasonable or plainly unjust. In those circumstances, this ground of appeal should be dismissed.

29I have some difficulty in understanding the reasoning behind the second ground of appeal. No Muldrock error was raised in the ground of appeal and yet it appears to be the focus of the submissions in support of the ground.

30In any event, there is no substance to the submission that the primary judge committed the error identified in Muldrock. His Honour did not engage in a two-stage process, nor did he give undue emphasis to the standard non-parole period. His Honour did no more than refer to the fact of the non-parole period and by reference to the sentence imposed on Hill, his Honour assessed the objective seriousness of the offending to be ""below, but not far below, the mid-range of objective seriousness of such offences"". The assessment of the objective seriousness of offending remains an important part of the sentencing process and of the intuitive synthesis upon which it is based.

31In that regard, the observation of Davies J (with whom Whealy JA and Rothman J agreed) in Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 is apposite:

""26 ... Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre-Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene. Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it. It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick.""

32This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground c: The sentence imposed caused the applicant to have a justifiable sense of grievance when the sentence is compared to the sentence imposed on Hill, his co-offender.

33This was the ground to which the applicant's submissions, both oral and in writing, were substantially directed. The applicant submitted that in the case of Hill, the start point for the sentence imposed by the primary judge was 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years. After adjustment for an early plea of guilty and assistance, that was reduced to a head sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. After the intervention of this Court, the final sentence became imprisonment for 3 years and with a non-parole period of 2 years, i.e. a start point of imprisonment for 6 years. In the case of the applicant, the start point was 10 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and 4 months. After adjustment for the early plea of guilty, the sentence became imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months.

34The applicant submitted that a comparison of this sentence with the sentence ultimately imposed on Hill, engendered in him a justifiable sense of grievance, i.e., that a reasonable person looking at the circumstances of the case would regard the applicant's sense of grievance as justified.

35In that regard, the applicant relied upon Regina v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114. There Johnson J (with whom Giles JA and Hoeben J agreed) said:

""34 The elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community - the issue is whether the particular sense of grievance or injustice is a legitimate one: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 at 611 per Mason J. The test for determining the existence of a sense of grievance is objective not subjective. What has to be demonstrated by the person complaining on the grounds of parity is not that he feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the offender's grievance is justified: R v Doggett (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 March 1996, unreported) per Sully J; R v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251 at paragraph 6.""

36The applicant submitted that because Hill had received a longer sentence than the applicant from the primary judge, it followed that the primary judge must have accepted that the objective criminality of the applicant was less than that of Hill. Accordingly, it was submitted, the applicant should be re-sentenced to a sentence which was less than that imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on HilHHill. The applicant submitted that the comparison of the circumstances of Hill and the applicant, set out by the primary judge in his remarks on sentence, made it clear that both had strong subjective cases, minimal criminal histories and good prospects of rehabilitation. It also made clear that the objective seriousness of their offending was similar.

Consideration

37The difference in the starting point for the sentences of the applicant and Hill, with Hill having a higher starting point was never explained by the primary judge. Such a result was not justified by his Honour's fact finding. While his Honour regarded the objective criminality of the offending as the same, it is also clear that his Honour found that the applicant occupied a higher position in the drug distribution hierarchy than did Hill. The applicant dealt directly with the principal, AM, whereas Hill was further down the chain and dealt with either the applicant or Robinson. A proper appreciation of their respective positions in the drug distribution hierarchy can be seen by a comparison of what each was to receive as a result of the fourth transaction. Hill was to receive $1,500 whereas the applicant was to receive $3,500. This fact was specifically noted by the primary judge.

38It follows that an important point of distinction between the applicant and Hill is that the applicant clearly occupied a higher position in the drug distribution hierarchy than did Hill. This has always been regarded as an important consideration in drug supply cases (DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [67]; R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 at [19]).

39Another important point of distinction is the difference in the subjective cases of the applicant and Hill. This Court found that the primary judge erred in his failure to adequately assess Hill's subjective case. The Court found that the strength of his subjective case was such that his sentence should be halved. This was because of the significant element of coercion, to which reference has already been made at [25]. There was no similar important factor in the applicant's subjective case.

40The final consideration is that to which the majority (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) referred in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [33]:

""33 There is a question whether a sentence which would otherwise be appropriate can be reduced on the ground of disparity to a level which, had there been no disparity, would be regarded as erroneously lenient. In Lowe that question was answered explicitly in the affirmative by Mason J and less explicitly but to like effect by Dawson J, with whom Wilson J agreed. It has also been answered in the affirmative in a number of cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales. On the other hand, as Simpson J correctly pointed out in R v Steele, the existence of a discretion, where unjustified disparity is shown, to reduce a co-offender's sentence to one which is inadequate does not amount to an obligation to do so. Certainly, the discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal to reduce a sentence to a less than adequate level would not require it to consider reducing the sentence to a level which would be, as Street CJ put it in R v Draper, ""an affront to the proper administration of justice."" Moreover, if the relevant sentencing legislation, on its proper construction, does not permit an inadequate sentence to be imposed, there can be no discretion on appeal to impose one. Whether or not the discretion to reduce a sentence to an inadequate level is available, marked and unjustified disparity may be mitigated by reduction of the sentence appealed against to a level which, although lower, is still within the range of appropriate sentences.""

41In this case, there is no basis for a justified sense of grievance on the part of the applicant. There were important differences between his case and that of Hill. He occupied a higher position in the drug supply hierarchy and Hill had a much stronger subjective case.

42Finally, the criminality of this offence was significant, albeit that the primary judge regarded it as ""below, but not far below the mid-range of objective seriousness of such offences"". The maximum sentence was life imprisonment. There was a standard non-parole period of 15 years. These are clear indicators of how seriously the community regards this kind of offence. The applicant occupied an important position in the drug supply hierarchy. The quantity of drugs involved was substantial. The offence was committed for financial gain. The applicant neither offered nor provided assistance to the authorities. The only positive features were his subjective case and good prospects of rehabilitation. In my opinion, no lesser sentence was warranted.

43I am not persuaded that a breach of the principle of parity has taken place. Even if it had, to impose a lesser sentence would be likely to produce a sentence which was erroneously lenient.

44This ground of appeal has not been made out.

45The orders which I propose are:

1. In relation to grounds of appeal a. and b. I would refuse leave to appeal. 

2. In relation to ground of appeal c., I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.

46McCALLUM J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that there is no merit in grounds 1 and 2. The parity ground raises a more difficult issue. The starting point of the sentences passed at first instance (by the same judge) was 12 years in the case of Mr Hill and 10 years and 8 months in the case of the applicant. That was difficult to reconcile with the judge's findings, including his Honour's conclusion that the applicant was higher within the drug hierarchy than Mr Hill and the higher remuneration the applicant expected to receive. Notwithstanding that circumstance, there was no parity ground in Mr Hill's appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal made a finding of patent error and saw fit to pass a lesser sentence without reference to the sentence passed on the present applicant and notwithstanding the considerable leniency reflected in the combined discount of 50% for Mr Hill's early plea (25%) and past and future assistance to authorities (a further 25%): see Hill v R at [3]. 

47The sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal upon Hill's re-sentence was extremely lenient. However, since it is a sentence passed by this Court, I do not think it is open to approach the present application on the premise that it was erroneously so. The result is that the respective starting points are now 10 years and 8 months for the applicant compared with 6 years for Mr Hill. Acknowledging the greater discount obtained by Mr Hill, the disparity between the sentences is revealed more acutely in the fact that the applicant faces a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months compared with 2 years in Mr Hill's case. In my view, the two sentences entail a measure of disparity that warrants a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant, even having regard to the matters considered above by the Chief Judge.

48The High Court in R v Green; R v Quinn considered the authorities as to whether a sentence which would otherwise be appropriate can be reduced on the ground of disparity to a level which, leaving aside the disparity, would be regarded as erroneously lenient. In the passage set out above in the Chief Judge's judgment, the Court said, ""whether or not the discretion to reduce a sentence to an inadequate level is available, marked and unjustified disparity may be mitigated by reduction of the sentence appealed against to a level which, although lower, is still within the range of appropriate sentences.""

49Although the sentence passed on the applicant was in my view entirely appropriate, I consider that there is marked and unjustified disparity between his sentence and that passed on Hill in his appeal such that, in order to afford equal justice to the two men, this Court should reduce the applicant's sentence. I would accordingly have exercised my discretion to reduce the sentence to a level which was lenient but still within the appropriate range. My conclusion that a reduced sentence would still be within the appropriate range is necessarily informed by the required premise that, since the comparator was imposed by this Court, it is not open to me to regard it to be erroneously lenient. Since mine is a dissenting view and having regard to the matters to which I have referred, it is not necessary and arguably not appropriate to articulate the lesser sentence I would have imposed

50SCHMIDT J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		30 August 2013",2013-08-29 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706255,Colquhoun v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 191,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: In May 2009 the appellant stood trial in the District Court before a judge and jury on five charges of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The circumstance of aggravation relied upon was that the alleged victim of the assaults was under the age of 16 years, being then aged 13. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on Counts 1, 4, and 5 and not guilty on Count 2. It was unable to reach a verdict on count 3. The appellant has appealed against his convictions but not against the sentence that was subsequently imposed.

2Whilst represented by counsel, the appellant appealed on the following three grounds:

""1. A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the admission and/or use of evidence of sexual interest of the appellant.

2. The trial judge misdirected the jury with respect to the use of evidence of uncharged conduct.

3. A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the Crown Prosecutor's cross-examination of the appellant with respect to the truthfulness of evidence of other witnesses in the Crown case.""

3After he ceased to be represented, the appellant added eight further grounds and on 18 January 2013 filed applications for orders directing the examination, in relation to those further grounds of appeal, of 13 named persons including six police officers and three other persons called by the Crown as witnesses at the trial. These applications related not only to the present proceedings but also to those dealt with in Colquhoun v R (No 1) [2013] NSWCCA 190. It is convenient to address the three grounds formulated by counsel before addressing the further grounds and the examination applications.

THE FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES

4The complainant was 13 at the time of the alleged offences in April and May 2007. He lived at Gymea in Sydney with his father and often visited the Gymea Bay Baths. At the Baths, the appellant, who was then 43 years old, befriended the complainant and gave him biscuits and chocolates. They fished and swam together and on three occasions the complainant and some of his friends fished from the appellant's boat. 

5The first count of the Indictment related to an incident that the complainant said occurred when he stayed overnight on the appellant's boat. He said that on that occasion the appellant cuddled him, with his penis being near to the complainant's bottom, and that the appellant touched the complainant's penis on the outside of the complainant's clothing. The appellant was convicted on this count.

6The complainant also said that on another occasion on the appellant's boat the appellant lay on top of him and put his arms around the complainant and tried to kiss him. This alleged conduct was the subject of Count 2, upon which the appellant was acquitted.

7As to Count 3, upon which the jury could not agree, the complainant's evidence was that whilst at the Baths on 30 May 2007, the appellant cuddled the complainant and kissed him twice on the cheek. 

8As to Count 4, upon which the appellant was convicted, the complainant gave evidence that, whilst at the Baths, the appellant cuddled him and touched him on the bottom with his hand three or four times. A police officer, Detective Harris, gave evidence that he observed this occurring.

9As to Count 5, upon which the appellant was also convicted, the complainant gave evidence that, whilst at the Baths on 30 May 2007, the appellant grabbed him and had his penis touching the complainant's bottom. In support of this count the Crown relied upon DVD film taken by Sergeant Harris of the alleged incident. Based on the film, the Crown put to the appellant in cross-examination that he pushed his penis toward the complainant's bottom in a ""humping"", sexual manner. The appellant denied these allegations, as he did those related to the other counts.

GROUND 1: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE ADMISSION AND/OR USE OF EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL INTEREST OF THE APPELLANT
GROUND 2: THE TRIAL JUDGE MISDIRECTED THE JURY WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF EVIDENCE OF UNCHARGED CONDUCT

10These grounds of appeal relate to the following evidence.

Photographs and video recordings of children possessed by the appellant

11The Crown tendered in evidence a large number of photographs, and a segment of video footage, found in the possession of the appellant. A number of children are depicted in the images, including the complainant and other child witnesses in the Crown case. Many of the images are close up photographs of children in their swimming costumes or wearing boxer shorts only. The Crown Prosecutor cross-examined the appellant extensively about the photographs, emphasising that they were of children not adults and the partially clothed state of many of the subjects.

12In his closing address, the Crown Prosecutor referred to the fact that there were no adult males in the photographs and put that they were not ""the sort of photographs that one might find in a family album. In my submission they are consistent with unusual interest"".

The evidence of child witnesses WA and EG

13WA and EG's evidence was that the appellant gave children confectionary and other gifts. EG said that the appellant acted in a way that was ""strange for his age"" as he associated with children and not adults, whilst WA said that the appellant used to put his arm around him. 

14In his closing address the Crown Prosecutor submitted that the appellant had an ""unusual relationship"" with boys in the area and that he had a ""focus on dealing with adolescent or near-adolescent boys"". 

15The trial judge referred to this evidence in his Summing-Up.

16EG also said, in a record of interview that was tendered, that he had seen the appellant touch the complainant on the back and the leg. This evidence did not relate to the incidents the subject of the charges against the appellant.

17The Crown Prosecutor referred to this evidence in his closing address.

The Summing-Up

18The trial judge's Summing-Up at the trial included the following:

""In this case you have heard evidence of matters which are not the subject of the charges. I have already told you that what the prosecution was doing [sic]. You have heard [the complainant] give evidence about other matters which might in your mind look like an offence but which have not been charged. The law permits that type of offence [semble: evidence] to be given by the prosecution for a number of purposes, to put the alleged offence in context, to show that it did not occur in a total vacuum. It is permitted to show the relationship between the accused and the complainant or to show that the accused had sexual desire or feeling for the complainant. If you accept that evidence it may show consistency in the account of the alleged crime.

The evidence of the uncharged acts, the other matters which are said to constitute context, there are a number of them. [The complainant] gave evidence of cuddling and touching at various stages in the relationship he had with Mr Colquhoun. Certainly on the three occasions that he said he was on the boat he talked about Mr Colquhoun cuddling him continuously. 

Mr Colquhoun denies that there was [a] third time. That is a matter for you to decide. There is not only cuddling but there is also evidence from [the complainant] of inappropriate touching at various times. Those offences are charged. I will come in a minute to the actual matters that the Crown says constitute the offence.

In evidence you have a large number of photographs. Most of these photographs are of various young boys who Mr Colquhoun identified. The Crown has introduced those matters into evidence because it says that that is material from which you can draw an inference about the attitude of Mr Colquhoun towards young people. You have heard a lot of evidence about the relationship of affection between Mr Colquhoun and [the complainant]. Those matters, the Crown says, gives you a context in which Mr Colquhoun, it says, did the alleged acts. It shows the relationship between Mr Colquhoun and [the complainant] and it also constitutes material from which you can make certain inferences about sexual desire.

You will have to look at all that evidence individually. I am not going go through it in great detail. The Crown Prosecutor has done that and you will have the evidence there. You can think about what he said to you. Look at it with great care then decide whether or not you are satisfied that it occurred. You must not use this evidence of uncharged acts to show that it is more probable than not that any of the five offence occurred. Just because the evidence was given it does not make it true. If you are not satisfied about any of these uncharged acts then you must decide whether the prosecution has failed to prove the context, the relationship or the sexual desire.

You do not have to be satisfied of all of them but even if you are satisfied of the uncharged acts you can only use it for the limited purposes that I have explained, that is the context of the events which give rise to the charges, the relationship or the existence of some sexual desire. It does not prove the offence for which it is charged and you must not use it for that purpose. You must not reason that if Mr Colquhoun did those uncharged acts that he is the sort of person who would commit the offence with which he is charged because the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he did those specific acts which constitute the charges. If you are not satisfied about some or any of the uncharged acts does that cause you to have reservations about accepting his evidence about the offences charged? So I repeat to you the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and it can only do so on the evidence that bears on the commission of the five offences charged"" (emphasis added) (AB pp 23 - 25).

Consideration

19As the Crown submitted on appeal, evidence was admissible at the trial to support the complainant's evidence that he regularly spent time with the appellant, swimming and fishing, in a context that was likely to be enjoyable for a young boy. Such evidence was relevant to explain why the complainant continued to associate with the appellant. It therefore helped in the evaluation of the complainant's evidence and was thus admissible (Norman v R [2012] NSWCCA 230 at [23] - [35]).

20However in my view the evidence to which Ground 1 relates cannot wholly be characterised in this fashion. Its volume and content, and the way it was used in cross-examination and address, leave little doubt that, viewed objectively, the bulk of it was tendered and relied upon to demonstrate the sexual interest of the appellant in the complainant. This amounted to use of the evidence to show that because he had a sexual interest in the complainant the appellant was more likely to have committed the offences alleged. However unless the conditions specified in ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act 1995 for the admission of such tendency evidence are satisfied, the evidence may not be admitted or used for that purpose (Colquhoun v R (No 1) [2013] NSWCCA 190 at [22]). The Crown did not contend that these conditions were satisfied in the present case.

21The evidence to which the trial judge referred in the passages from the Summing-Up that I have quoted in [18] above went beyond the categories of evidence covered by Ground 1 to refer to evidence of the complainant that the trial judge thought the jury might consider indicated that the appellant had committed offences further to those charged, that is, ""uncharged acts"". However it was not permissible for the jury to use any of the evidence to which the trial judge there referred, as the trial judge said it could, to establish sexual desire or feeling of the appellant for the complainant. An invitation to the jury to use the evidence for impermissible tendency reasoning was thus made explicit in the Summing-Up, particularly in the portions of the quoted passages that I have highlighted (see [18] above). 

22Furthermore, it was not permissible for the trial judge to indicate to the jury, without a more precise explanation, that the evidence was able to be used to ""show the relationship between the accused and the complainant"". Without identification of a permissible use, such as to put the complainant's evidence in context and render it explicable, this direction was liable to encourage the jury to use the evidence for the impermissible tendency purpose of suggesting that, because of an apparent sexual interest of the appellant in the complainant, the appellant was more likely to have committed the offences charged. As explained by McClellan CJ at CL in DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; 200 A Crim R 206 at [29], evidence ""is not relevant merely because it discloses aspects of the relationship between an accused and a complainant. There must be an issue which the evidence may explain or resolve by placing the alleged events in their true context"".

23Understandably the Crown conceded on appeal that the trial judge's directions concerning the use to which this evidence could be put by the jury were erroneous. It however submitted that the Court should nevertheless apply the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and dismiss the appeal. To apply that proviso, the Court must be of the view that ""no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"". I do not consider that to be the situation here. The evidence in question, together with the submissions and directions to the jury concerning it, constituted a prominent aspect of the trial, with the potential to be regarded by the jury as of considerable significance to their deliberations. 

24As the determination of the prosecution's case required the jury to form views as to the credit of the complainant, the appellant and Detective Harris, and the reliability of their evidence, this Court is not in a position to form, and give effect to, a view as to the appellant's guilt, at least as to Counts 1 and 4. This would be necessary for the Court to apply the proviso.

25Count 5 is arguably in a different position as the Crown relied heavily in relation to it upon the objective evidence of the DVD film taken by Detective Harris. However I am not satisfied that, when considered on its own, without the benefit of the complainant's evidence, the film demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that, as the Crown alleges, the appellant placed his hand on the complainant's buttock, that his groin came into contact with the complainant's buttocks, and that the appellant ""humped"" the complainant (or that following his contact with the complainant, the appellant moved his hand ""as though adjusting his penis""). The complainant's evidence cannot be taken into account by this Court because, first, its acceptance would require this Court to make a finding concerning the complainant's credit, which it is not in a position to make, and, secondly, regard cannot be had to the jury's obvious acceptance of the complainant's evidence due to the erroneous directions given to it. 

26In these circumstances, the conclusion follows that the trial miscarried and the appellant's convictions must be quashed. The points the subject of Grounds of Appeal 1 and 2 were not taken at the hearing, but the appellant should not in my view be precluded by r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules from taking them on appeal as he has demonstrated that he has lost a not unrealistic chance of acquittal such that a miscarriage of justice has occurred (R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; 62 NSWLR 346 (see [21])). I would accordingly grant leave to rely upon those two grounds.

GROUND 3: THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE APPELLANT

27As the appellant has succeeded on Grounds 1 and 2, this ground, and those remaining, can be dealt with briefly. It is sufficient to say that in relation to Ground 3 I do not regard the Crown Prosecutor's cross-examination of the appellant concerning the evidence of the complainant and two child witnesses as departing from the standards of fairness identified in Libke v R [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559. Subject to one matter, the prosecutor did no more than perform his duty to test the credibility and reliability of the account which the appellant gave (ibid at [75]). Questions asking the appellant to identify error in the witness' accounts were not unfair when read in the context of the prosecutor's detailed cross-examination. The absence of objection to the cross-examination by the appellant's counsel, either in the course of the cross-examination or subsequently, provides some support for the view that there was no unfairness apparent in the context of the trial (ibid at [76]). 

28The qualification to these views is that at one point the prosecutor asked the appellant whether one of the witnesses had been lying. This was impermissible (Gonzales v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 321; 178 A Crim R 232 at [147] - [151]) but when assessed in the context of the whole of the lengthy cross-examination, in which the prosecutor permissibly asked the appellant on a number of occasions whether evidence given by Crown witnesses was correct, this question did not in my view result in any unfairness to the appellant (see ibid at [152]).

GROUND 4: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE ADMISSION AND/OR USE OF FALSIFIED EVIDENCE

29This ground relates to a typed note and a $10 bank note found between the spokes of the complainant's bicycle after the appellant had been arrested and charged with the offences in question. The authorship of the note was in issue at the trial. On appeal the appellant seeks to lead further evidence on the issue but has not demonstrated any arguable basis for an entitlement to do so.

GROUND 5: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE ADMISSION AND/OR USE OF POLICE STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE USING KNOWN LIES

30This ground of appeal should be rejected, at least for the reason that the written police statements about which the appellant complains were not in evidence at the trial. 

GROUND 6: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF CRIMINAL OFFENCES COMMITTED BY POLICE INVOLVED

31The appellant complains that Detectives Harris and Brown disclosed the appellant's criminal history to the complainant's father prior to him providing a written statement to the police. This ground should be rejected at least for the reason that it was open to the appellant to cross-examine Detectives Harris and Brown at the trial on this issue but he chose not to do so. It was understandable that the appellant made this choice as the cross-examination would have disclosed his criminal history to the jury but if the appellant had regarded this issue as of particular significance he could earlier have sought a judge alone trial. 

GROUND 7: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF COACHING OF WITNESSES

32The appellant submits that Detective Harris coached the complainant and his father in their evidence. This was an issue that could have been and, in the case of the complainant, was raised at the trial. The appellant seeks to elicit further evidence on this issue but has demonstrated no arguable basis for an entitlement to do so.

GROUND 8: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF UNFAIR CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE APPELLANT

33The appellant has raised no arguable issue beyond that raised by Ground 3 above. The ground should accordingly be rejected.

GROUND 9: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF MAJOR INCONSISTENCIES AND LACK OF CREDIBILITY OF CROWN WITNESSES

34The matters relied upon by the appellant were all open to be, and largely were, raised by the appellant at the trial. No arguable issue is raised by this ground of appeal. 

GROUND 10: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF PREJUDICIAL EVIDENCE FROM [DETECTIVE] CHRISTIAN POPP AND THE TRIAL JUDGE'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY DIRECT THE JURY

35The appellant's submissions in relation to this ground of the appeal raise a similar issue to that raised by Grounds 1 and 2, which have been upheld. Otherwise no arguable issue is raised by the appellant under this heading. 

GROUND 11: THE PREJUDICIAL AND UNFAIR DIRECTIONS GIVEN TO THE JURY BY THE TRIAL JUDGE DID MISGUIDE THE JURY CAUSING A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE

36To some extent the appellant's submissions reflect Grounds 1 and 2, which have already been upheld. Otherwise, the submissions do not raise any arguable issue. In particular, the appellant's submission that the Summing-Up ""mocked and downplayed"" the appellant's case is clearly not well founded.

THE APPLICATIONS TO HAVE WITNESSES EXAMINED

37The appellant's applications for the examination of witnesses (see [3] above) are largely designed to support the grounds of appeal referred to above. As he has not established that any of the witnesses sought to be examined could give evidence that he would be entitled to lead for the first time on appeal, the applications should be dismissed.

ORDERS

38As Appeal Grounds 1 and 2 have been upheld and the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act found to be inapplicable, the appellant's convictions of the offences charged in the counts of the Indictment upon which verdicts of guilty were returned must be quashed. A new trial should be directed but it will remain for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether a retrial should occur bearing in mind, inter alia, that the appellant has already served the bulk of the non-parole period of his sentence. That period is due to expire on 18 October 2013, with the overall term to expire on 18 November 2015.

39For the above reasons, I propose the following orders:

(1) Grant leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on Appeal Grounds 1 and 2.

(2) Allow the appeal.

(3) Quash the appellant's convictions entered following the return of verdicts of guilty at his trial in May 2009.

(4) Direct a new trial of the charges upon which the appellant was convicted.

(5) Dismiss the appellant's applications for examination of witnesses filed on 18 January 2013 insofar as they relate to the present proceedings.

41ADAMSON J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

		22 August 2013",2013-08-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706258,Colquhoun v R (No 1) [2013] NSWCCA 190,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: In February 2009 the appellant stood trial in the District Court before a judge and jury charged with the following offences:

(1) One count of an aggravated act of indecency with a person under the age of 16 years (aged 11 years) contrary to s 61O of the Crimes Act 1900, the circumstance of aggravation being that the child was under the appellant's authority.

(2) Two counts of aggravated indecent assault of a person under the age of 16 years (aged 11 years) contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.

2The child concerned was the same in each case.

3The appellant was convicted of each offence and subsequently sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 6 years and 4 months, comprising an effective non-parole period of 5 years, commencing on 19 July 2007 and expiring on 18 July 2012, and an additional term of 1 year and 4 months, expiring on 18 November 2013. He has not been granted parole.

4The appellant appeals against his convictions on the eight grounds addressed below. Grounds 1, 2 and 3 are supported by written submissions signed by counsel. The remaining grounds were advanced after the appellant ceased to have legal representation. They are supported by lengthy handwritten submissions of the appellant.

5Also after he ceased to be represented, the appellant filed applications for orders directing the examination, in relation to his five further grounds of appeal, of 13 named persons including six police officers and three other persons called by the Crown as witnesses at the trial. These applications related not only to the present proceedings but also to those dealt with in Colquhoun v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 191. It is convenient to address the three Grounds of Appeal formulated by counsel before addressing the further grounds and the examination applications.

THE FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES

6In late December 2006 or early January 2007 the complainant, who was then aged 11, was befriended by the appellant, then aged 42, at the Gymea Bay Baths in Sydney which they both frequented. The appellant gave the complainant gifts, including sporting equipment, computer games and a mini motor cycle, and took the complainant to the movies, kayaking, horse riding and tenpin bowling. The complainant's mother, who was estranged from the complainant's father, was aware of the friendship. The appellant occasionally visited the complainant's and his mother's home and stayed overnight on three occasions. 

7On 6 March 2007 the complainant went to the appellant's home for dinner, with the complainant's mother's knowledge and agreement. 

8According to the complainant's evidence, whilst the complainant was playing on a computer at the appellant's home that night, the appellant pulled his pants down and masturbated, ejaculating on the complainant's leg. This alleged conduct was the subject of Count 1 in the Indictment. On the complainant's evidence, the appellant then grabbed the complainant's clothes and pulled his penis. This alleged conduct was the subject of Count 2.

9In late March 2007 the appellant stayed the night at the complainant's home. According to the complainant's evidence, he asked the appellant to massage his back, which was sore, but the appellant massaged not only his back but his buttocks as well. Both were dressed only in shorts. This alleged conduct was the subject of Count 3. 

10The complainant's mother and sister both gave evidence that they observed the massage occurring and that the mother intervened, requiring the appellant to leave immediately. The complainant's sister said that she had seen the appellant straddling the complainant, with his knees on either side of the complainant's buttocks, and massaging the complainant with baby oil. The complainant's mother said that she observed the appellant massaging the complainant with oil, with the complainant lying on his stomach, his boxer shorts pulled down to the top of the crack of his buttocks, and the appellant lying beside him. Neither said that they observed the appellant massaging the complainant's buttocks.

11In evidence at the trial, the appellant agreed that he had been friendly with the complainant and had given him many gifts. He denied the conduct alleged in Counts 1 and 2 of masturbating in the complainant's presence and touching his penis. As to Count 3, he agreed that he had given the complainant a massage but denied touching his buttocks. 

APPEAL GROUND 1: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE ADMISSION AND/OR USE OF EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL INTEREST OF THE APPELLANT

12On appeal the appellant complained of the admission and use made at the trial of the following evidence. As no relevant objection was made by the appellant's counsel at the trial, the appellant is precluded from relying upon this ground of appeal unless leave is granted under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.

(a) Photographs and video recordings of the complainant in the appellant's possession

13The Crown tendered at the trial two compact discs which the appellant had given to the complainant's mother. They contained photographs, and video footage, of scenery, people unrelated to the trial, animals, the appellant and a large number of photographs of the complainant, many whilst he was dressed only in boxer shorts or a swimming costume. The photos and footage were taken by the appellant, or under his direction.

14After the complainant's mother had produced the CDs to the Court, the Crown Prosecutor asked her what, in general terms, she had seen on them. She responded:

""Lots of photos of him [the complainant] with like only his cossies on and just of his body and not his head"".

15In cross-examination the Crown Prosecutor put to the appellant that he took photos of the complainant partially clothed that focused on his body rather than his head, and he played a segment of the video footage which he suggested to the appellant panned down the complainant's body, seeming ""to focus momentarily on his crotch area"". The appellant responded that the camera ""just happened to be stopped at that point in time"".

16In his closing address the Crown Prosecutor quoted the evidence of the complainant's mother referred to above and put that:

""[W]hen one looks, for instance, at the thumbnail photographs [hard copy photographs taken from the CDs], one might wonder whether they are the sorts of photographs that would appear in a family album"".

17He also put that there was reason to wonder whether the relationship of the appellant and complainant was ""a father/son relationship in any genuine sense"".

18In the course of his Summing-Up, the trial judge said:

""[The Crown Prosecutor] asked you to look at the images in exhibit B [the CDs] very closely, and said they are not the kind found in a family album, and in particular drew attention to one of the videos I think it was in which he stated there was a concentration of the camera on the crutch of the complainant. Now that is my paraphrase of the argument put by him. You will have the video. If you think that is a correct submission you will act up on [sic] it. If, on the other hand, you think it is not that is a decision making fact finding process for you and you alone"".

19On appeal the appellant submitted that the CDs were not relevant except to show sexual interest of the appellant in the complainant and that the evidence therefore amounted to tendency evidence which was inadmissible, in the absence, as was the case, of compliance with s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (see also s 101).

20In response the Crown submitted that the evidence was admissible as context evidence to provide, for example, independent support for the complainant's evidence of the types of recreational activities that he enjoyed with the appellant, and that the evidence did not suggest any sexual interest of the appellant in the complainant. The Crown implicitly accepted that if the evidence did in fact suggest the existence of such a sexual interest, compliance with ss 97 and 101 would have been required, or the trial judge would have had to direct the jury that it could not use the evidence to draw an inference of such sexual interest, that is, not to use it for a tendency purpose. No such direction was given, or sought, at the trial.

21Where the impugned evidence is that an accused, on an occasion prior to that of the alleged offence, had a sexual interest in a child complainant and acted upon that interest, the need for a tendency direction is readily apparent. If such evidence is admitted simply because it provides context to the complainant's evidence (and not as a result of compliance with ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act), the jury must be directed not to use it to reason that because the accused has engaged in such conduct on a prior occasion he or she is the more likely to have engaged in it on the occasion the subject of the charge.

22The courts have however gone further and treated evidence of an accused's sexual interest in, at least, a child complainant as being tendency evidence subject to the strictures of ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act even when the evidence does not suggest that the accused had previously committed an unlawful sexual act in relation to the child (R v AH (1999) 42 NSWLR 702 at 708 - 9; Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95; 171 A Crim R 462 at [87]; DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; 200 A Crim R 206 at [30] and [39]; ES v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 197 at [38] - [40]; ES v R (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 198 at [67]; RWC v R [2010] NSWCCA 332 at [126] - [128]; BBH v R [2012] HCA 9; 245 CLR 499 at [152]; Steadman v R (No 1) [2013] NSWCCA 55 at [10]). Whilst I have some misgivings as to whether evidence which is in effect no more than evidence of motive (because it is simply evidence of a sexual interest of the accused in the complainant which has not been acted upon) should be treated as tendency evidence, the Court must accept the existing approach, at least where, as here, there has been no specific challenge to it. 

23I turn then to the question of whether the evidence on the CDs was capable of suggesting a sexual interest of the appellant in the complainant and whether the jury was invited to use it for that purpose.

24Neither of the parties invited this Court to view the material on the CDs which were not in any event provided to the Court. In evidence however were some 123 small (""thumbnail"") photographs (Exhibit Y; duplicated to some extent in Exhibit C) representing images on the CDs. It is not clear whether they comprise all the still photographs on the CDs. 

25Many of the photographs were admissible for the context purpose described by the Crown in that they show the complainant engaging, by inference in the company of the appellant, in obviously enjoyable outdoor activities such as canoeing, fishing and horse riding. They thus support the complainant's evidence about the context in which the alleged offences were committed and assist in understanding why the complainant associated with the appellant. However many of the photos did not serve this purpose. These comprised close-up photographs of the complainant wearing only boxer shorts or a swimming costume, with many photos of his body, some showing his body but only part of his head. The evidence elicited by the Crown Prosecutor from the complainant's mother (see [14] above) emphasised to the jury this character of the photos, as did the cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor of the appellant (see [15] above).

26The Crown Prosecutor's cross-examination concerning a segment of the video footage on the CDs similarly drew attention to the focus of the appellant, as the camera operator, on the complainant's body, including his crutch. This was well capable of carrying the implication that the appellant's interest in the complainant was of a sexual nature. The same implication arose out of the Crown Prosecutor's reference in closing address to the complainant's mother's evidence concerning the CDs and his assertions concerning the nature of the relationship between the appellant and complainant (see [16] and [17] above).

27A similar approach to the CDs was evident in the trial judge's Summing-Up with its reference to the jury looking ""very closely"" at the images on the discs and to the question of whether in the video footage the camera lingered on the complainant's crutch (see [18] above). In this context, the trial judge's indication to the jury that if it accepted the Crown's argument concerning the video footage, it would ""act up on it"" [sic] was plainly an invitation to the jury to form a view as to whether the footage indicated a sexual interest of the appellant in the complainant and, if it concluded that it did, to take that into account in deciding whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant committed the offences charged.

28For the reasons I have given earlier, this invited the jury to engage in impermissible tendency reasoning.

29In these circumstances, the photographs and film should not have been admitted into evidence, except to the extent that they were reasonably necessary to provide support for the complainant's evidence concerning the context in which the alleged offences were committed. Moreover, the evidence having in fact been admitted, the jury should not have been invited, expressly or impliedly, to use it as tendency evidence. Rather, directions not to so use it should have been given as there was a real risk that the jury might otherwise embark upon impermissible tendency reasoning (see Toalepai v R [2009] NSWCCA 270 at [49]). Whether those directions would have been sufficient to overcome the prejudice to the appellant from admission of the evidence need not be considered as no such directions were given.

30No relevant objection was taken on behalf of the appellant at the trial, but nonetheless leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should be given as the impermissible admission and use of this evidence was a significant feature of the trial, without which it is realistically possible that the outcome of the trial might have been different (R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 20; 62 NSWLR 346 see [20] - [21]). For the same reason, the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is inapplicable: I am unable to be satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. In those circumstances, the appellant's convictions should be quashed.

(b) A telephone conversation between the complainant's mother and the appellant subsequent to the alleged offences

31The appellant complained also of the admission of evidence from the complainant's mother of a telephone conversation she had with the appellant approximately two weeks after the third alleged offence in which the appellant said that he was missing the complainant and that a psychiatrist whom he had consulted had said that he was suffering from separation anxiety.

32She also said:

""I said to him, well you better tell your psychiatrist that you touched my boy and you put your hands all over him and you have him sitting on your lap and that and - and the psychiatrist will tell you that that's not legal"".

I do not accept the appellant's submission that in saying this the complainant's mother was accusing the appellant of criminal acts that had not been charged. What she said was explicable as, primarily, a reference to the massage that was the subject of Count 3 of the Indictment and her reference to the complainant sitting on the appellant's lap was not of itself an accusation of criminal conduct. This part of the mother's evidence was not of significance as it amounted to little more than a repetition of her evidence concerning the massage and was not alleged to have resulted in any express or implied admission by the appellant of what she asserted. Whilst it should have been regarded as irrelevant and therefore not admitted into evidence, its admission was of no consequence. 

33Furthermore, contrary to the appellant's submission, the statements attributed to the appellant that he was missing the complainant and was said to have separation anxiety did not amount to evidence of sexual interest of the appellant in the complainant rendering the evidence inadmissible as tendency evidence. The evidence was comprehensible as simply indicating a close friendship between the appellant and the complainant and thus as supporting the complainant's evidence of that. It was not suggested to this Court that at the trial this evidence had been sought to be used as evidence of sexual interest. 

34I would accordingly reject this second aspect of the first ground of appeal.

35As the appellant has established under Ground 1 an entitlement to have his convictions quashed the remaining grounds of appeal can be dealt with briefly.

APPEAL GROUND 2: THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING PROPERLY TO DIRECT THE JURY REGARDING A MOTIVE TO LIE ON THE PART OF THE COMPLAINANT AND HIS MOTHER

36At the trial the appellant asserted that the complainant and his mother had a motive to lie because requests by them to the appellant for money had been rejected. On appeal the appellant complained that the trial judge failed to direct the jury that a rejection of this asserted motive should not necessarily lead to the conclusion that those Crown witnesses were telling the truth. The appellant did not seek any such direction at the trial. 

37The relevant principles are as summarised by Latham J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Hidden J agreed) in Doe v R [2008] NSWCCA 203 at [58]:

""58 ... Where the defence case directly asserts a motive to lie, and the issue has accordingly featured in the addresses of counsel, a miscarriage of justice may arise if the summing up gives undue emphasis to the issue of motive ('the central theme'), or goes beyond the asserted motive and poses the question at large, and the summing up does not contain full, firm and clear directions on the onus of proof, including a direction that the accused bears no onus to prove a motive to lie and that rejection of the motive does not justify a conclusion that the evidence of the witness is truthful.""

38The alleged motive to lie, although put directly in the final address by counsel for the appellant, overall received little emphasis at the trial. Whilst there was cross-examination about requests for money, it was not put to the complainant or his mother that they gave false evidence as a result of the appellant refusing these alleged requests. The trial judge referred to the alleged motive in his Summing-Up but that issue could not, in the sense referred to in Doe, be regarded as in any way a, or the, central theme of the Summing-Up. Moreover, there was no express or implied invitation by the judge to the jury to reason that the rejection of the motive would indicate that the witnesses were telling the truth.

39In these circumstances, and as the trial judge gave the jury clear instructions about the onus and standard of proof, both before and after his reference to the motive to lie, I do not consider that it was necessary that the direction referred to by the appellant be given. The fact that the point was not taken at the trial provides some support for the view that, in the context of the trial, fairness did not require such a direction to be given.

40As there was in my view no necessity for the direction to be given, I would refuse a grant of leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon this ground.

APPEAL GROUND 3: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE APPELLANT REGARDING THE COMPLAINANT'S EVIDENCE

41The Crown Prosecutor put to the appellant in cross-examination that there were a number of matters in the complainant's evidence which the appellant did not dispute. The appellant responded:

""Probably, probably, yeah - like the rest of the statements, there's a pinch of truth surrounded in lies"".

42The Crown Prosecutor then put details of the complainant's evidence to the appellant and sought confirmation of their truth. This part of the cross-examination culminated in a request to identify anything else that the complainant said that was wrong.

43In my view, when considered as a whole, the cross-examination was fair to the appellant, constituting legitimate, forceful testing of the appellant's evidence consistent with the principles stated in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; 230 CLR 559. That it was fair in the context of the trial derives support from the appellant's counsel's lack of objection to it.

44At one point the Crown Prosecutor asked the appellant whether there was anything else that the complainant lied about. Although this was impermissible (Gonzales v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 321; 178 A Crim R 232 at [147] - [151]) the question did not in my view cause any unfairness when assessed in the context of the lengthy cross-examination and the appellant's initial assertion that the complainant had lied (see [41] above).

APPEAL GROUND 4: THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING TO DISMISS THE JURY ON APPLICATION BY THE DEFENCE FOR THE TRIAL JUDGE SAYING ""OTHER PRISONERS"" TO THE JURY IN OPENING DIRECTIONS

45During his opening remarks to the jury, the trial judge referred in passing to the sentencing of ""other prisoners"". The appellant's counsel sought a discharge of the jury on the grounds that the remark was prejudicial to the appellant because it informed them that the appellant was in custody. His Honour rejected the application and in my view the appellant has not shown any basis, consistent with the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 4; 55 CLR 499, for interfering with his Honour's discretionary decision. In any event I cannot see that there was any prejudice to the appellant as, even if the jury concluded from the remark that the appellant was in custody, there was no reason for it to infer that this was so other than because of the charges then before the Court for trial.

APPEAL GROUND 5: THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING PROPERLY TO DIRECT THE JURY REGARDING THE ONUS OF PROOF AND THE DEFINITION OF INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED EVIDENCE

46The appellant has not under this heading in my view raised any arguable point concerning the trial judge's directions to the jury. 

47In his submissions in relation to this ground of appeal he has however also raised an issue concerning fresh evidence, as follows.

48The complainant's evidence at the trial was that the massage the subject of Count 3 came about because he had injured his back playing soccer. The appellant, on the other hand, said that the complainant had hurt his back in falling off his bike. On appeal the appellant seeks to tender a letter from the Sutherland Shire Football Association stating when the soccer competition season usually begins and ends, with a view to proving that the complainant could not have hurt his back playing soccer. There are a variety of reasons why this application should be refused. It is sufficient to say that the letter does not identify any particular season and in any event says nothing about the possibility of the complainant having hurt his back in pre-season soccer practice or whilst playing informally with friends.

APPEAL GROUND 6: A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF CRIMINAL OFFENCES COMMITTED BY THE POLICE INVOLVED AND THE FAILURE OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO DEAL WITH THE CRIMES ACCORDINGLY

49In his handwritten submissions in support of this ground of appeal, the appellant raised a variety of matters as follows. 

50First he asserts that one of the police officers investigating the offences improperly disclosed the appellant's criminal history to Crown witnesses. The appellant had the opportunity to, but did not, raise this issue at the trial. It is not surprising that he did not do so before a jury, but it was open to him to apply for a judge alone trial if he regarded the issue as of sufficient significance. The appellant is bound by his conduct below and in my view is not entitled to raise these allegations for the first time on appeal. 

51Secondly the appellant seeks to rely on appeal on a forensic report dated 30 January 2009. The report was in existence and in the possession of the appellant at the date of trial. The issue to which it relates, namely tampering with evidence, was agitated at the trial at length. The evidence is not fresh evidence and does not in any event appear to assist the appellant. He should not be permitted to tender it.

52Thirdly the appellant asserts that Detective Prior committed perjury at the trial. However Detective Prior was cross-examined at length at the trial and the appellant's submissions do not establish any error in the proceedings at the trial.

53Fourthly the appellant complains of the rejection of a permanent stay application that he made in May 2008. The application was based upon the foreshadowed use of certain tendency evidence. When the Court rejected the Crown's attempt to use that evidence, there remained no basis for the stay that had been sought. There is accordingly no substance in this complaint.

54Fifthly the appellant complains on appeal that the trial judge ""did err, by not making comments about the criminal offences by police did [sic] pervert the course of justice by concealing the crimes"". However the appellant has not established that there was any basis in the evidence for his allegations concerning the conduct of the police.

APPEAL GROUND 7: THE CREDIBILITY OF THE CROWN WITNESSES AND THE INCONSISTENCIES OF THEIR ACCOUNTS OF EVENTS GAVE RISE TO A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE

55The appellant first asserts that the complainant's mother and sister lacked credibility because of matters that occurred in other court proceedings. To the extent that these matters may have been relevant they should have been, but were not, raised at the trial. It is not open to the appellant to rely upon them on appeal.

56Secondly the appellant asserts that there were inconsistencies in the evidence called by the Crown at the trial. The points made by the appellant were all open to be, and largely were, raised by the appellant's counsel in address at the trial. None were of such significance as to cast doubt upon the soundness of the jury's verdicts.

57Thirdly the appellant refers to further evidence he wishes to rely upon on appeal. One item is the letter concerning the soccer season referred to in [48] above. Others concern other aspects of the hearing. In my view the appellant has not raised any arguable case to justify the admission of any of the items of evidence as new or fresh evidence on appeal and his application to lead that evidence should be rejected. To a significant extent the submissions made by the appellant in relation to Grounds of Appeal 5, 6 and 7 rely on evidence he hopes to elicit from witnesses the subject of his application for examination orders (see [5] above). As no basis has been shown for the making of those orders, his application should be dismissed (see further at [63]).

APPEAL GROUND 8: UNSAFE CONVICTION

58The following observations that I made (with the concurrence of RA Hulme and Garling JJ) in TWL v R [2012] NSWCCA 57 are applicable to consideration of this ground of appeal in the present case:

""58 This ground has its foundation in s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The High Court recently considered this ground in SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400. It is apparent from the judgment of the plurality in that case, and from the earlier decision in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487, that the question for a court of criminal appeal when considering such a ground of appeal is not simply 'whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty' (M at 493 and SKA at [11]). The Court is also required to conduct its own 'independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality', and to assess whether, 'notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'nonetheless it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand' (M at 492 - 3; SKA at [14]). 

59 This requirement was reflected in the later reference in the plurality judgment in SKA to the 'central question' as being 'whether on the evidence the Court was satisfied that the applicant was guilty of the offences' (at [20]). 

60 In light of my conclusion that the appellant's conviction should be quashed on other grounds, it is neither necessary nor desirable that I deal with this ground of appeal to the full extent dictated by SKA and M. In particular, as there were deficiencies in connection with the trial that resulted in a miscarriage of justice, it would be inappropriate for me to form and express a view, based upon what I find to have been a flawed trial process, on whether at the trial the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged.

61It is appropriate however that I consider the first aspect of the task identified in SKA and M, that is, whether on the evidence that was before the jury, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. The answer is to this question is important in considering whether a retrial should be ordered because it should be assumed, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, that the Crown would lead substantially the same evidence at a retrial as that which it led at the initial trial. If that evidence was not capable of sustaining a conviction, it would be inappropriate to order a retrial on substantially the same evidence: Gerakiteys v R [1984] HCA 8; 153 CLR 317 at 321. As was noted in R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; 228 CLR 233 at [52], 'if the evidence is unchanged at the second trial, accused persons should not be placed in jeopardy of conviction by a second jury where an appellate court has found that the evidence was insufficient at the first trial'. Moreover, 'a new trial should not be ordered merely to give the prosecution an opportunity of mending its hand and presenting new evidence at the second trial which it failed to present at the first' (ibid at [52]).""

59This approach was reiterated by me in TWL v R (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 93. An application for special leave to appeal was refused by the High Court ([2012] HCA Trans 257).

60Applying the approach in TWL, the question for present consideration is therefore whether on the evidence that was before the jury it was open to it to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offences charged. In my view, if the jury accepted the complainant's evidence as credible and reliable, it was clearly open to it to convict the appellant. When assessed in the context of the relationship described by the complainant, confirmed by other evidence including that of the appellant himself, there was no inherent unlikelihood in the complainant's evidence of the alleged offences. Nor were there any significant inconsistencies in the evidence or other matters that would have rendered a properly instructed jury's verdicts of guilty challengeable on appeal. The appellant's submissions in relation to this ground of appeal largely repeat submissions made earlier and do not raise any arguable matter that requires further consideration.

61In a case such as the present this Court cannot form a view about whether the appellant's guilt was proved beyond reasonable doubt because that would require it to form a view about the credibility of the witnesses called at the trial, in particular the complainant. This is a function for the jury, not this Court and, as the jury was not properly instructed, this Court cannot rely upon the jury's verdicts as establishing the credibility of the Crown witnesses.

62For these reasons, although the trial miscarried and the verdicts of guilty should accordingly be quashed, the appellant is not entitled to verdicts of acquittal as there was evidence at the trial upon which a properly instructed jury could have convicted him. In these circumstances, a new trial should be ordered. The Director of Public Prosecutions of course retains a discretion as to whether to proceed with such a trial. The fact that the term of imprisonment to which the appellant was sentenced will expire on 18 November 2013 will be a relevant consideration in this regard. 

THE APPLICATIONS TO HAVE WITNESSES EXAMINED

63The appellant's applications for the examination of witnesses (see [5] above) are largely designed to support the grounds of appeal referred to above. The appellant has not established that any of the witnesses sought to be examined could give evidence that he would be entitled to lead for the first time on appeal. Accordingly the application should be dismissed

ORDERS

64For the above reasons, I propose the following orders:

(1) Grant leave under r 4 of Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on Appeal Ground 1.

(2) Allow the appeal.

(3) Quash the appellant's convictions entered following the return of verdicts of guilty at his trial in February 2009.

(4) Direct a new trial of the charges upon which the appellant was convicted.

(5) Dismiss the appellant's applications for examination of witnesses filed on 18 January 2013 insofar as they relate to the present proceedings.

65FULLERTON J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

66ADAMSON J: I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2706261,R v Bin LI and Kun WANG [2013] NSWDC 211,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1Almost everyone has had to go to some trouble to obtain a credit card. They fill in forms and have their credit rating assessed by a financial institution. It becomes easier once a person already has one or two cards. 

2For most people, buying high end designer goods is an expensive luxury. It might be a gift or an indulgence and they might take some time to pay off the purchase with interest if they use a credit card. Others of course can afford such goods regularly because they earn more money from their occupation. 

3Financial institutions have made it easier for us to afford such purchases. We can buy the goods immediately, the retailer is paid, the financial institution bears the risk of waiting for us to pay for the goods but we agree to pay interest for the advance of the funds. These arrangements underpin a vast number of transactions by individuals. They promote commerce and personal convenience. 

4Bin Li, whom I am sentencing today, aggressively abused the processes and understandings which underlie these arrangements which benefit so many. He went about fraudulently manufacturing his own credit cards. These cards were used to buy high end luxury goods which he then arranged to on-sell for cash. He had a virtual factory set up at his home for producing hundreds and hundreds of false but effective credit cards. He had a person out shopping with these cards. If one card did not work, another was tried. His operation was extensive, well organised and was backed by sophisticated plant and equipment. 

5In addition Bin Li had equipment to manufacture cards - other than credit cards, such as driver licences - which could be used for identification purposes. Therefore the system we are all familiar with of producing a form of identification was being deliberately undermined by Bin Li's criminal activity. To make matters even worse, when the police arrested him at his home they found a good deal of methylamphetamine, far more than for personal use. 

6At the same time I am sentencing one of Bin Li's shoppers, a woman named Kun Wang.

7I will first set out the crimes that each of them has been charged with. Then I must say something about what they did to bring about these charges. I will say something about each of them personally. I will consider the arguments put in their favour and by the prosecution and then I will sentence them.

8I am sentencing Bin Li for four offences. Two of the charges are against s 256(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 of making, or possessing the equipment to make, a false document. To each of those offences the New South Wales Parliament has fixed a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. For the identity documents I am sentencing him for a crime against s 192L of the Crimes Act. That is for possessing equipment capable of making identification documents intending that the documents be used to commit a serious offence. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 3 years to that offence. 

9I am also sentencing him for a crime against s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 because the amount of methylamphetamine he had was so much that it is assumed it was for supplying it to somebody else. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment for that offence. When I am sentencing him for the drug offence he has asked me to take into account an offence of knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime which is an offence against s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment to that crime. I say that to indicate how serious it is. I have signed a certificate saying I will take that offence into account. 

10I am sentencing Kun Wang for one crime of knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime and that is also an offence against s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act and, as I said, carries a maximum of 15 years imprisonment. 

11I will now turn to saying something about what the police found to bring about these charges. 

12A multi-agency strike force was monitoring Mr Li, related to identity crimes. Part of exhibit A is a statement of facts. I will quote some passages from that statement of facts, which explain the crimes Mr Li was engaged in. They had intercepted telephone calls between Mr Li and Ms Wang. The telephone calls, say the facts ""illustrate an agreement between the two persons to commit numerous and ongoing frauds using counterfeit credit cards and false identification documents."" 

13Mr Li was in on the criminal activity from the outset. The facts say that at the time the agreement was made, the intention by Mr Li was that numerous transactions and purchases of a fraudulent nature would be carried out. The two of them set about defrauding ""numerous vendors"". The facts say that Mr Li ""instructs, guides and receives 'reports' from"" Ms Wang and others. The conversations illustrate the extent of their involvement in purchasing the goods. On one occasion Ms Wang was buying goods and Mr Li was acting as a lookout. Mr Li told Ms Wang in one call that ""people shopping for him at Gucci in Westfield Cabramatta had reported over $4000.00 in purchases."" Instructions were given by Mr Li to Ms Wang and discussions were about onselling the goods. The facts go on to say that the police allegation is that Ms Wang ""acted as both a shopper for and a disposer of fraudulently obtained goods."" That is obvious from the statement of facts which is a part of exhibit C (the case against Ms Wang) where at one stage Ms Wang ""discussed the on-selling of the goods"" to someone else, indicating how much the other person wanted. 

14When the police came to arrest Mr Li at his home they found four plastic bags. Three of those contained what turned out to be methylamphetamine. There were digital scales, clear resealable bags and fingerprints of Mr Li. The fourth bag contained something which was described by the police as ""commonly used in the supply of prohibited drugs to break down drug purity for bagging and sale."" 

15In another part of the house police found ""two machines designed for embossing blank plastic cards."" They found computer terminals and on one of them ""nearly one hundred lines of data, appearing to be credit card numbers"". They found a card printer which can be used to print text and characters onto plastic cards and they found a printer with information about New South Wales and Victorian driver licences and blank membership cards. The facts say that a ""full list of information obtained from the printer ribbons was produced by the document examiners and contains thousands of sets of identification information"". In another part of the house they found holograms consistent with those used in making Victorian driver licences. They found a heat press/laminator which can be used for embossing cards as well as a magnetic card encoder or reader. All of the equipment I have just described was made the subject of a charge under s 256 of the Crimes Act. 

16A further charge was laid regarding some additional equipment found. In Mr Li's garage police found blank unembossed cards with logos, designs and information consistent with those located on genuine credit cards from financial institutions. The agreed facts go on to say the ""credit cards were of an extremely high quality and would be reasonably expected to induce a reasonable person to accept them as genuine"". The police say the ""combined total of individual credit cards seized from the garage area alone was 11,707."" They found blank unembossed cards contained in some boxes in his bedroom and some blank Medicare cards, once again of extremely high quality. There were almost 400 cards in his bedroom. 

17The offence of possession of material to make identification documents under s 192L of the Crimes Act was a charge regarding 120 blank cards found in Mr Li's garage containing ""markings that are consistent with security features located on genuine New South Wales driver licences"". 

18The offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime - which I am taking into account on the drug offence sentence - concerns an amount of nearly $29,000 cash found in a bedside drawer. The facts go on to say that the telephone intercepts demonstrate that Mr Li ""regularly received sums of money in the value of thousands of dollars from persons reporting to him as a supervisor of shoppers"". Police go on to say that the large amount of money represented ""proceeds from the onselling of the fraudulently obtained goods"" which was ""not banked in order to avoid law enforcement detection."" 

19Concerning Ms Wang, police went to her home on the same day, which was 18 October 2011. They had been listening in on conversations between Ms Wang and Mr Li, so they had heard Mr Li giving directions to Ms Wang about the use of the cards. It is clear Mr Li was the person in charge and giving directions to Ms Wang. At one stage Mr Li asked if Ms Wang had ""sold the goods off"" and Ms Wang said ""no."" Mr Li told Ms Wang ""to work harder as he was short of money."" They discussed percentage discounts off the retail value of the high-end goods. 

20The facts for Ms Wang say that when they searched her house they found ""a large quantity of high-end designer goods"". These included ""handbags, clothing and jewellery of various brands including Versace, Gucci, Salvatore Farragoma, Balenciaga and Burberry."" They found about 90 items; some of them were new and had tags attached and most of them were in Ms Wang's bedroom. They found a large quantity of empty bags from designer clothing and accessories stores. They listed in the facts a dozen or more items that came to a total of just under $28,000. They found an iPhone with photographs of ""high-end designer goods"" as well as receipts. They found what appeared to be ""a number of handwritten shopping lists detailing purchases or prospective purchases of high-end designer goods."" They found a credit card which was consistent with those produced by Mr Li. They searched a safe deposit box which contained Australian currency (which was not the subject of a charge) two diamond rings and two Swiss watches, one of which was valued at $7000. 

21I now need to say something about the personal circumstances of Mr Li and Ms Wang. Mr Li is 39. There is a pre-sentence report about him, which became exhibit B. He was educated in China and did a mechanic's apprenticeship. He came to Australia when he was 25 and had casual employment. He became addicted to gambling but he says he had dealt with it by the time he was arrested. Some years ago he started to smoke methylamphetamine, which he stopped using on his arrest. He acknowledged his wrongdoing, asserting ""that he would not ever repeat them, citing as his reason that they were too risky."" The author of the pre-sentence report observed that Mr Li ""appeared to have a pragmatic rather than a principled approach to criminal behaviour, and to lack insight into the effects of his actions on others, including the broader society."" It did however note he appeared to be ""reflectively aware of the negative effects of gambling and illicit drug use"". 

22There is a report from a forensic psychologist about Mr Li and it became exhibit 1. It noted he expressed considerable regret and remorse. He has a de facto wife of some 24 years and has two adult children at university. It was clear to the psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro, that he was close to his family. The psychologist thought he had some anxiety disorder with features of depression and the psychologist thought he would improve with continuing support and therapy and should have professional assistance. 

23Exhibit 2 was a handwritten letter to the Court acknowledging what he did was wrong and expressing his remorse for the offence against the community and his own family. 

24I also have information about Ms Wang. She is the mother of a daughter who is under 10 years of age and Mr Li is in fact the father of her daughter. 

25There is a report about Ms Wang from Danielle Hopkins, a clinical psychologist. It notes Ms Wang's mother came to Australia in 2009 from China where Ms Wang herself was born. Ms Wang has had tertiary education and has worked in the finance industry. She said that she knew that her use of credit cards was fraudulent and said that she ""did not realise that credit card fraud 'was this serious'."" She said she won't get into trouble again. The psychologist noted that Ms Wang ""endorsed some depressive and anxiety symptomatology and she lacks extensive social support"". The psychologist noted that it remained unclear whether there was any undue influence from Mr Li. She trusted him. The psychologist concluded that Ms Wang ""is not an anti-social woman and has no specific criminogenic needs. She is the carer for her elderly mother and daughter and has commitments in the community, recently becoming employed.""

26Ms Wang is well regarded by her neighbours and her friends who say that she is very remorseful for what she has done. In an affidavit, Ms Wang explains her mother's and daughter's health issues. Those health issues are not serious in my opinion but, nevertheless, I do note the evidence about them. 

27Neither Mr Li nor Ms Wang gave evidence before me.

28Mr Li has a prior criminal record. In 1999 he was given a gaol sentence for fraudulent misappropriation. He appealed and was given a non-custodial sentence but failed to comply with the conditions and was given periodic detention. He also has convictions for goods in custody and obtaining money by deception. He received a suspended sentence for those. He has an offence for obtaining by deception committed in 2001. Again he was given a gaol sentence but appealed and was given periodic detention. Although those offences were committed some time ago, it is a significant criminal record for the purposes of the offences that I am sentencing him for. 

29Mr T Watts, who appeared for Mr Li, acknowledged that his client must spend some more time in custody but argued that it should not be very much more. He referred to the expression of his client's remorse. I note that but I do not put much weight on it because it is mainly unsworn and untested and in some instances second hand. I accept the submission of Mr T C Spohr, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, that the offences concerning s 256 and 192L involved a series of criminal acts. He also submitted that they were committed for financial gain. But I really regard that as part of the crime rather than a separate aggravating feature. He argued which, I accept, that the identity card offences were preparatory, whereas the credit card offences were participatory. 

30Mr Watts said that his client had been cooperative with the authorities, but this could not be pressed as far as making an allowance for assistance. He has been engaged in courses in custody which is a good start to rehabilitation. He will need some additional time on parole to pursue his rehabilitation because of the better availability of an interpreter in his dialect in the community rather than in gaol. Mr Watts argued that the sentences could all be concurrent because they were closely interconnected. He argued that his client had pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. Mr Spohr acknowledged this and, in due course, I will discount his sentence by 25 per cent because of his plea of guilty.

31Mr Spohr acknowledged that there was room to find concurrency in respect of the various card offences but the drug offence was distinct. He referred to a high degree of purity of the drug found but I accept Mr Watts' submission that it would need to be demonstrated to me beyond reasonable doubt that the purity was significant as an aggravating factor, and I am not so convinced. I suspect Mr Spohr is quite right but I take Mr Watts' point. I regard the victims as the financial institutions rather than individuals, as Mr Watts argues. I accept from Mr Watts that there is no evidence of actual supply of the methylamphetamine, including over a period of telephone intercepts, but he also acknowledged realistically the presence of the scales and the bags.

32I propose to impose one sentence for all of the offences using the provisions of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. However, I need to indicate what sentence would have been imposed for each offence if I were imposing separate sentences. I have already set out the extent of Mr Li's involvement in these crimes. As I said, his operation was extensive, well organised and was backed by sophisticated plant and equipment. He already has a criminal record for dishonesty offences. I must take into account dealing with the proceeds of crime when I fix a sentence for the drug supply.

33I regard an appropriate sentence for the drug supply as one of 6 years imprisonment. I regard an appropriate sentence for each of the offences of possessing equipment to make a false document as 7 years imprisonment. I regard an appropriate sentence for the offence of possessing equipment for making an identification document as 6 months imprisonment. I would have structured the sentences by fixing the two 7 year sentences for the s 256 offences to commence 6 months apart, the first on 18 October 2011 and the second on 18 April 2012. I should say that Mr Li has been in custody relating to these offences since 18 October 2011. 

34I would then fix the 6 months sentence to commence 18 July 2018 and to expire on 17 January 2019. The 6 year sentence for the drug offence would commence 18 October 2014 and expire on 17 October 2021. 

35I would regard an appropriate overall sentence therefore as being one of 10 years. However, Mr Li has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I will therefore discount that sentence by 25 per cent, so his overall sentence will be 7½ years. 

36Normally for a 7½ year sentence, a non-parole period would be 5 years and 7 months, that is 75 per cent of the sentence. But I accept Mr Watts' argument that his client needs more time in the community for counselling and I also take into account that this is his first full-time custodial sentence. I therefore propose to affix his non-parole period as 4 years and 7 months. In due course I will fix a sentence for Mr Li which will be 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 7 months.

37Mr T Gartelmann, who appeared for Ms Wang, pointed out that his client was 34, her mother is 65 and her daughter is 7. He referred to their medical issues which, as I have said, I do not regard as very serious. He pointed to the fact that his client had no previous convictions and character references which I have taken into account.

38Mr Gartelmann acknowledged appropriately that his client had to face a sentence of imprisonment but argued that it may be served in the community. He emphasised the distinction between the sentence I give to his client and the one which I might deliver to Mr Li. He is right about that. He referred me to authorities about the significance of the maximum penalty. I remind myself that the maximum for this offence is 15 years imprisonment. As the High Court has said in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357, maximum penalties are relevant because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case that I am sentencing a person for and they provide some yardstick. Adapting what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Tsakonas v R [2009] NSWCCA 258; (2009) 197 A Crim R 581 at 593 ([56]) the statutory maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years in this case ""must be regarded as reflecting the legislative view of the seriousness of the conduct"" falling within s 193B(2). I do not accept that this could fall into the category of a ""highly technical version of the offence"" of the kind referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294; (2009) 198 A Crim R 135 at 142 ([31]).

39Mr Gartelmann appropriately drew comparisons with cases which involved far greater amounts, so far as the property was concerned. However I need to bear in mind that the maximum fixed by Parliament for this offence is 15 years imprisonment. This is obviously regarded by Parliament as a very serious kind of offence. Mr Gartelmann acknowledges that but says that the behaviour of Ms Wang falls towards the lower end of the range of seriousness. But the authorities also urge me to take into account the actual physical acts which a person undertakes in committing crime. I have in mind R v Guo [2010] NSWCCA 17; (2010) 201 A Crim R 403 at 415 ([87]) as well as in Tsakonas v R at 593 ([65]). This was a well organised offence. It is not a one-off holding of goods for another. Ms Wang played an important role in a systematic theft of money from financial institutions. Her role was less than that of Mr Li and she is far from being a principal but she was the operative putting the criminal scheme into action by using the cards, accumulating some of the goods and participating in selling them. I am sentencing her for an offence under s 193B of the Crimes Act. Section 193A defines dealing in the proceeds of crime widely and it could be said that Ms Wang was involved in receiving, possessing, concealing and disposing of the proceeds of crime as well as engaging directly in a transaction. Mr Gartelmann pointed out that her offending behaviour occurred just over five weeks or so which is true; but on the other hand her offending behaviour was not over a day or so, it was over a significant period of time. Nor was it an opportunistic or spontaneous offence. Ms Wang was a facilitator of serious criminal activity. 

40I regard an appropriate sentence for Ms Wang as being one of 3 years imprisonment. Because she pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity I would discount that sentence by 25 per cent and fix it at 2 years and 3 months imprisonment. 

41I accept that there are special circumstances for adjusting what would be the normal non-parole period of about 20 months on such a sentence. They include that it is the first time for her in custody and she will need to resume her life in the community and her employment and her care for her mother and her daughter. I should add, to make it clear, that the circumstances of her mother and daughter are not such that they could be regarded as hardship in the way that the High Court of Australia and the Court of Criminal Appeal have accepted as necessary to reduce a sentence. 

42I would regard an appropriate non-parole period as being one of 1 year and 2 months which will commence along with the sentence today.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Li, I will sentence you first. Stand up. 

43Mr Li, I fix a non-parole period of 4 years and 7 months. It commenced on 18 October 2011 and will expire on 17 May 2016. The overall sentence is 7 years and 6 months which commenced on 18 October 2011 and the overall sentence expires on 17 April 2019. The first date on which you will be eligible to be considered for parole is 17 May 2016. Have a seat, Mr Li.

44Ms Wang, I fix a non-parole period of 1 year and 2 months which commences today.

HIS HONOUR: I am sorry. Ms Wang spent some time in custody, I think 8 days?
SPOHR: Seven days I think your Honour is the calculation that I originally had.
HIS HONOUR: Yes.
SPOHR: Was in custody from 20 October 2011 and admitted to bail on 27 October 2011.
VELASQUEZ: That's correct, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Good, 7 days, 8 days? I am going to make it 8.
SPOHR: Yes, thank you, your Honour.

45I will backdate the sentence to take into account your time in custody. I will backdate it by eight days to 15 August 2013. Your non-parole period is 1 year and 2 months commencing on 15 August 2013, expiring on 14 October 2014. The balance of the term is 1 year and 1 month and the overall sentence is 2 years and 3 months commencing on 15 August 2013 and expiring on 14 November 2015. The first date on which you will be eligible for parole is 14 October 2014. Have a seat, Ms Wang.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Spohr, Ms Herczog and Ms Velasquez, would you just take your time looking at the mathematics and tell me if I have made any errors or indeed if there are any other errors of the kind that could be dealt with under s 43 whilst we are all here.
SPOHR: If I can indicate on behalf of the Crown, your Honour, I am not able to identify any such issues so I do not wish to be heard in respect of those issues.
HIS HONOUR: Those issues, right, but just wait and see what Ms Velasquez and Ms Herczog say.
VELASQUEZ: Your Honour, 14 October by my calculations and my calendar is correct.
HERCZOG: I don't see any errors.
HIS HONOUR: Thank you both. Yes, Mr Velasquez?
VELASQUEZ: I would ask that the matter stand for about five minutes, I would like to discuss the thing with Ms Wang.
HIS HONOUR: Yes, that's all right, sort of because we have got something else, a person in custody. One thing I will ask you two to get instructions on. Corrective Services say that sending to them psychological reports or psychiatric reports is helpful in their classification. Some prisoners do not want that sort of material floating around, some do not mind but Corrective Services make it clear that to those who classify, this material is helpful, very helpful. So if you would get instructions on that and then my Associate can fax them on Monday to the appropriate part of Corrective Services. All right, now did you want to say something, Mr Spohr?
SPOHR: Yes, your Honour, there's just two subsequent orders, both of which I don't think take up any time. The first one is that the Crown asks that your Honour makes a drug destruction order in respect of Mr Li's case for methylamphetamine.
HIS HONOUR: Mr Herczog?
HERCZOG: There is no objection.

46Under s 39P of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, I make a drug destruction order in respect of methylamphetamine found in Mr Li's premises, yes.

SPOHR: Thank you, your Honour, and the remaining order is in respect of Ms Wang's matter. I understand without meaning to verbal my friend from Mr Gartelmann that it is not opposed. There is an application pursuant to the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act for an amount of cash and for the proceeds that are the subject of the charge and I have the respective orders in respect of that but I will allow my friend to respond in respect of that.
HIS HONOUR: Right. Ms Velasquez, are you aware of that? Have you seen the documents?
VELASQUEZ: I haven't seen those documents. I would like to see them.
HIS HONOUR: That makes sense.
VELASQUEZ: I do remember something in relation to that from the last occasion.
HIS HONOUR: I will not force you into - I mean, I will allow you to get instructions. We can deal with it today or next week or even by consent or something so it sounds as though you two want to have a word to your respective clients, is that right?
VELASQUEZ: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Why don't I finish what I have to do which is to explain to Mr Li once again the sentence.

47I just repeat, Mr Li, your sentence is 7½ years. It commenced on the day that you were arrested so it commenced 18 October 2011. It finally finishes on 17 April 2019. The non-parole period that you must serve is 4 years and 7 months. That also started 18 October 2011 and that finishes on 17 May 2016 when you will be eligible for parole. Do you understand that? Okay. 

48Ms Wang, your sentence is 2 years and 3 months gaol. It commenced on 15 August 2013 and the overall sentence will expire on 14 November 2015. Your non-parole period is 1 year and 2 months. It also commenced 15 August 2013 and it will expire on 14 October 2014. Do you understand that? 

HIS HONOUR: Mr Spohr and Ms Velasquez, it just occurred to me, Ms Wang's sentence is under 3 years so I make the order for her parole, don't I?
SPOHR: Well, your Honour certainly has a discretion both to make that order and to set the terms. Actually, your Honour might be right, your Honour may have to make an order for parole at the expiry of the parole period.
HIS HONOUR: I think I do, yes, it is under s 50. So conditions, you both should think about. 

49Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an order directing that Ms Wang be released on parole on 14 October 2014. So Ms Wang, you will be released onto parole by my order, 14 October 2014.

HIS HONOUR: Now, you want a quick word with your clients?
VELASQUEZ: Yes, thank you, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Why don't I go off the bench for a moment and you, as well as having a word to your clients and getting instructions on the psychological stuff, have a word to Mr Spohr to see if you can agree on any conditions of parole which I have to fix. I will be back shortly.

SHORT ADJOURNMENT

HIS HONOUR: How did you go?
VELASQUEZ: I've spoken to Ms Wang and Mr Spohr, it was a condition of the plea agreement that we consent to these orders. I've seen those documents now and so that is consented to.
HIS HONOUR: So let's get the orders.
SPOHR: I'm afraid I'm now down to one copy of it.
HIS HONOUR: It doesn't bother me. That will go in the Court file.
SPOHR: I will have to get copies in due course, if I could hand them up.
HIS HONOUR: All right I will ask the court officer just to take those from you.
VELASQUEZ: And I've got instructions that it would not be appropriate for the psych report to be provided to Corrective Services.
HIS HONOUR: The answer is no.
VELASQUEZ: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: And you are acting for?
VELASQUEZ: Ms Wang.
HIS HONOUR: Just a second. 

50I make orders contained in the short minutes of forfeiture order signed by me sealed and dated today. The second document says ""gives is granted that"", it should read ""gives leave is granted that"". I make the orders contained in the document forfeiture order signed by me dated today and sealed by me. So they will go on the Court file and I guess if you like my associate can send you copies next week or not.

SPOHR: I would be extremely grateful, I know that your Honour's associate is busy but if that's possible.
HIS HONOUR: Next week sometime.
SPOHR: There's no rush.
HIS HONOUR: Have you got a card that you could give her?
SOPHR: Yes I can.
HIS HONOUR: Provide that at some stage and Ms Velasquez would you like a?
VELASQUEZ: Yes please.
HIS HONOUR: If you would provide my associate with your respective cards. Now Ms Herczog?
HERCZOG: In relation to Mr Li he consents to those reports.
HIS HONOUR: All right my associate will arrange for the report in respect of Mr Li but not in respect of Ms Wang and she will send that to Corrective Services on Monday. Is there anything else, conditions of parole for Ms Wang?
SPOHR: We didn't have a chance to discuss it but I wonder whether your Honour needs to go beyond the normal order that she accept the reasonable directions of, I don't think they're called the Probation and Parole Service, the Community--
HIS HONOUR: They've changed the names.
SPOHR: They're called something now they've all be amalgamated but whether your Honour orders simply orders that she accept the reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole Service.
HIS HONOUR: Does she need supervision, I doubt it. I'm not even sure that I need to - I'm thinking maybe good behaviour and notify any change of address and turn up to court if ordered to do so.
SPOHR: Your Honour maybe entirely right she may not need supervision but Probation and Parole Service maybe in a position to provide her with assistance and to that extent she may need, I don't know whether she needs to accept the reasonable directions, but I don't wish to be heard any further.
HIS HONOUR: Ms Velasquez?
VELASQUEZ: I think the appropriate condition would be to be of good behaviour in relation to accepting--

51Conditions for parole for Ms Wang are:
(1)That she be of good behaviour; 
(2)That she notify the Parole Authority of any change in her residential address; and 
(3)That she attend upon court if notified that she does so.

HIS HONOUR: Ms Wang when you're on parole you have to remain out of trouble, do you understand? If you move house you have to tell the Parole Authority and if you get a notice saying to come back to court you have to come, you understand that. Okay thank you.

		04 November 2013",2013-08-22 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706266,Mark Jonathan Wright v Regina [2013] NSWDC 157,"Judgment

1The appellant appeals against two convictions for possessing and/ or using a prohibited weapon, to wit oleosorin spray and one count of assault. The appeal proceeded on my examining the transcript of the evidence and the exhibits and my considering the reasons of the learned magistrate.

The Law

2The law relating to appeals from a magistrate concerning conviction is to be found in sections 18 and 19 of the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act, 2001 and Charara v the Queen [2006] NSWCCA 244 and in particular at paras 20- 22 per Mason P).
""20 In Da Costa v Cockburn Salvage and Trading Pty Ltd (1970) 124 CLR 192 at 208-9 Windeyer J described the difference between an appeal by way of rehearing on the one hand and a retrial or hearing de novo on the other in the following terms:
The rule ... provides that all appeals shall be 'by way of rehearing'. This does not mean that the appeal is a complete rehearing as a new trial is. It means that the case is to be determined by the Full Court, its members considering for themselves the issues the trial judge had to determine and the effect of the evidence he heard as appearing on the record of the proceedings before him, but applying the law as it is when the appeal is heard not as it was when the trial occurred....[A power to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgment that ought to have been given] does not ... curtail the recognition or respect that an appeal should accord to the decision of a trial judge.

21 These principles apply equally to an appeal by way of rehearing in a criminal matter where the appeal court has not seen the witnesses (Bell, Barendse v Comptroller-General of Customs (1996) 93 A Crim R 210 at 219-220).

22 The appellate role of the District Court in the present context is further reinforced by the references to ""appeal"" in ss18 and 19 and by the power, conferred by s20, to determine the appeal against conviction by setting aside the conviction or by dismissing the appeal. It is true that the Court moves to the disposition of the appeal by considering the totality of the material before it, including any ""fresh evidence"" that has been admitted, and making up its own mind on the critical issue of guilt. The prosecutor continues to carry the onus (Gianoutsos at [42]-[43]). But, as indicated in the passages quoted from Fox and Da Costa, the District Court must of necessity observe the ""natural limitations"" stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record.""


3In Harmer v Hare ([2011] NSWCCA 229)Whealy J.A, speaking of the duty of an appellate court reviewing factual findings of another court said this:
""165. I am not persuaded that any of the challenges to the factual findings have been made good. This court has the obligation to reverse primary findings of facts where those findings are not supported by the evidence, or where the inferences drawn by the primary judge are not available (see Devries v Australian National Railways Commission (1993) 177 CLR 472, at 479 per Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ). It is not, however, the task of the court to reverse findings of fact where those findings were open on the evidence, or where equally available inferences are available as to the probabilities of the occurrences found. In particular, where findings have been made regarding the credibility or reliability of witnesses based on their demeanour (and this extends to experts as well as lay witnesses), the court will be reluctant to intervene unless the findings are glaringly improbable.


4An appellate court must also look at the substance of what is said and not get into minute exercises of parsing and analysis. See Gommesen v R [2012] NSWCCA 226 esp at para 37 per Garling J
""37 It is necessary, in considering these submissions, to keep in mind, as this Court has often said, that it is inappropriate to take an overly critical approach to reasons contained in ex tempore judgments. What is relevant is the substance and essence of the Judge's remarks, rather that the result of any exercise of parsing and analysing closely, in an unduly technical way, the words and phrases used in the Remarks on Sentence""

Evidence Before the Magistrate


5The learned magistrate was required to make findings of fact and to indicate correctly the legal tests he was to apply to those facts as he found them.

6The learned magistrate was required to apply correct tests and to direct himself correctly when he came to consider the evidence. In my opinion he did that.

7The learned magistrate had to consider facts of what occurred on 20th July 2010 at 105 Oakland Avenue, the Entrance. The house at this address was next to the Reef Resort Hotel. The two premises were divided by a quite high steel fence. On the premises at 105 Oakland, a tree stump stood near the fence.

8The appellant was at the time a police officer who was not on duty and was present at the hotel with friends. The evidence showed clearly that he had been consuming alcohol heavily during the day before the incident that caused him to be charged and brought before the court.

9He had in his possession a canister of capsicum spray. Canisters of this type are issued to police officers for use in the course of their official duties. They are prohibited weapons and are not allowed to be carried by officers except when on official duty. He used the canister on 4th July in the course of his duties. He was then required to hand the partly used canister in at the police station and get a fresh issue of another canister. He did not do this, but kept the partly used canister in his possession until he used it on 20th July to spray Mr Lee Hannan, a man who was present at the premises adjacent to the hotel.

10The appellant claimed in evidence that he acted in self defence when he sprayed the victim with the capsicum spray. He claimed that he was standing near the fence dividing the two properties at a point near a water pump, that the victim standing on the other side of the fence threatened him, leaping up on the fence and putting him the appellant in fear of being struck.

11The learned magistrate believed Mr Hannan and regarded him as a truthful witness. Mr Hannan said he was standing on the stump to which I have referred with his hands on the fence and denied moving the stump or jumping up on the top of the fence.

12He found that the events occurred some distance from the water pump and that the victim was standing on a wooden stump. That stump was later weighed by the police at more than 135 kg. It took three police officers to move this stump.

Conclusions 

13The evidence to which I have referred of the weight of the stump supports the version given by the victim. Furthermore, as the learned Magistrate found, the appellant and his friend Mr Gambin both claimed that they were near the water pump but Mr Gambin gave no evidence of seeing the appellant using the spray although, later on, he saw the appellant throwing it in a fire and admitting that he had used it.

14Moreover, the learned magistrate was entitled on the evidence to believe the version given by the victim. That being so, self defence did not arise, since he found that the victim did not threaten the appellant at all.He also made findings of fact that clearly rejected the evidence given by the appellant of self defence, because he rejected the appellant's claim that he was near the water pump. He had regard in assessing the appellant's credibility the lies he told to police who came to investigate the incident, as well as other lies told to investigating officers subsequently.

15The learned magistrate correctly stated the test that applied where a defence of self defence was raised. 

16At the time the spraying incident occurred there is no doubt that the appellant was heavily intoxicated.

17Even if the incident had occurred as he claimed, in my opinion, the evidence would have enabled the Crown to rebut self defence beyond reasonable doubt because even if the appellant subjectively believed he was entitled to defend himself, his response was not reasonable and his state of intoxication could not be used by him as a basis for claiming that he may have believed he was acting reasonably. At best for him, he was defending himself against a man standing on the other side of the fence, who was armed with nothing and was acting in a threatening way by jumping up and waving his fist around. There could be no justification in law for his use of the canister in the circumstances of the night.

18The learned Magistrate was entitled also to rely on the evidence given by Mr Fowler and Ms Waddington, as well as the evidence of phone calls made to 000. The sound recording of the phone calls supports the evidence given by Ms Waddington of shouting, the throwing of objects, offensive language coming from those in the motel, including the appellant and what it was that Mr Hannan was doing.

19I have read the transcript myself and I found the evidence of Mr Hannan, Ms Waddington and Mr Fowler to be impressive and acceptable and I can well understand the learned Magistrate accepting all of it.

20The appellant claimed that he had forgotten he had the canister in his possession after 4th July. The learned magistrate did not believe this. He was entirely justified in refusing to believe this. The appellant returned the other weapons in his possession into the correct place in his locker at the police station to which he was attached. He had used the canister to subdue a man whom he arrested. It beggars belief that he simply forgot that he had this object on him until sometime on the day of the spraying incident. He could have placed it in safe custody at the nearest police station. He was cross examined about this and agreed that he could have done this when he realised that he had it, but he did not do so. He claimed that he did not put it in a bag in his room, because he feared it could be stolen. That lacks credibility, since he left a mobile phone in the same room getting charged.

21It has been submitted that the learned magistrate failed to consider a defence under sec 6(2) of the Weapons Prohibition Act, 1998. I do not agree. The issue was clearly put to the appellant that he did not forget and submissions were made by the solicitor prosecuting for the Crown that he did not forget. The learned magistrate did not believe the explanation given by the appellant and found that he consciously removed the canister and took it with him when he went on leave.

22At no time on 20th July was he acting in accordance with his duties. He did not spray Mr Hannan, while he was acting in the course of his duties.
23The learned magistrate's findings of fact are supportable and indeed, inevitable. They were also correct and he was correct in fact and in law in finding the offences proved.

Order

24I dismiss the appeal. I find the offences proved beyond a reasonable doubt

		29 August 2013",2013-08-22 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706267,R v Egan [2013] NSWCCA 196,"Judgment

1LEEMING JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R A HULME J: The Crown has appealed against sentences imposed upon Zenas Luke Egan (""the respondent"") by his Honour Judge Maiden in the District Court on 21 January 2013.

3Some details of the offences, their maximum penalties, standard non-parole period (if applicable), and the sentences imposed are as follows:


On 4 May 2011 at Newtown in the home of the applicant and complainant:
 


Sexual intercourse without consent (s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years - standard non-parole period 7 years: suspended sentence of imprisonment for 22 months.

Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (x 2) (s 59) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years: suspended sentences of imprisonment for 22 months.


Between 19 May 2011 and 21 March 2012 in Queensland and New South Wales after having been released on bail for the above offences:



Do act with intent to pervert the course of justice (s 319) - maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years: suspended sentence of imprisonment for 13 months.

Background to the offences

4A prominent feature of the case is the respondent's mental condition at the time of the offences. Before referring to the offences themselves it is appropriate to provide the context. I draw the following from the written submissions by Ms Rigg, counsel for the respondent (the accuracy of which was not contested), and the various medical reports that were in evidence.

5The respondent was aged 28 at the time of the offences and 30 at the time of sentence. He had no previous convictions and was found to be of excellent prior character. He enjoyed a positive upbringing and a good education.

6After leaving school he commenced an apprenticeship as a chef and in 2003, at the age of 21, he joined the Royal Australian Navy. He was married that year but the marriage ended in emotionally difficult circumstances in 2007. His relationship with the complainant began in 2007/2008. They lived together in naval assisted accommodation in Newtown.

7The respondent rose to the rank of Recruit Cook in 2003 and Able Seaman Cook in 2008. He saw active service in Iraq and was deployed on vessels to Samoa, Timor, Indonesia, Hawaii and Vanuatu as well as undertaking work around Australia. His service brought the presentation of three medals and a badge.

8He saw confronting situations during his naval service, including a boy being sexually molested in Samoa and, shortly prior to his return to Australia in April 2011, a person engaged in producing baby coffins in West Timor where there was a high infant mortality rate. He saw freshly dug graves decorated only with baby dummies and bottles because of the extreme poverty in the area. He is said to have become distressed generally about witnessing hardship in regions of poverty.

9Relationship issues with the complainant arose about a month before the offences of 4 May 2011. He was at sea at the time. The complainant was due to begin new employment at Perisher Valley and was going to depart Sydney before his expected return date. He sought leave and arranged to fly home early when his ship docked in Cairns. He arrived back in Sydney on 23 April 2011. 

10On 25 April 2011, he took an overdose of paracetamol and was taken to the Emergency Department of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. The history recorded was that he had recently returned from naval deployment during which he witnessed confronting events; he was having relationship issues and also had been experiencing sleep deprivation. He felt depressed, but did not want to kill himself. 

11On 27 April 2011, he was transferred to the Navy Ward at St Vincent's Hospital.

12Dr Geoff McDonald, a consultant psychiatrist, reviewed the respondent on 28 April 2011. He received a history that included that the overdose was an impulsive act with the aim of relieving distress and producing sleep, with no suicidal intent. There was a two-month history of ""moderately depressed mood with partial vegetative features"". Dr McDonald considered that the ""trigger"" was relationship tension concerning his absence from home and his next overseas deployment in September. There was also the contribution of the respondent having missed attending the complainant's sister's wedding while overseas; the complainant's recent retrenchment and subsequent decision to pursue employment at Perisher Valley; an inability to use the gym while at sea; and some physical ill-health (pain in the knee and a painful pilonidal cyst).

13Dr McDonald made a diagnosis of ""depressive episode of mild to moderate severity"". The respondent was to be discharged from St Vincent's on 28 April to return home and was to see a psychologist regularly. With regard to the complainant, Dr McDonald recorded that the respondent believed that both of them remained committed to the relationship.

14On 3 May 2011, he was reviewed by a clinical psychologist, Ms Marilyn Johnston. He reported that his mood levels were steady and that he felt more relaxed having had some time away from work. He was worried about the future and the uncertainty about his career, although he wanted to re-join his ship. When asked about his relationship with the complainant he said that ""things were going well with them, but that she had a lot on her plate and her parents had suggested she see a psychologist"". Ms Johnston planned to see the respondent again on 12 May 2011 when cognitive behavioural therapy for mood disorder was to commence.

The offences

15There were agreed facts before the sentencing judge from which the following is drawn. It is necessary to refer to all of the detail to enable an appreciation of the serious gravity of the respondent's conduct.

16The agreed facts commenced with reference to the respondent and the complainant having been in a relationship for about three and a half years. About a month before 4 May 2011, the complainant came to the view that the relationship was over. The respondent did not see it the same way. They continued to live together but in separate bedrooms. 

17At about 1.20am on Wednesday 4 May 2011, the respondent entered the complainant's bedroom and turned the light on. He shook her and woke her. She reached for her mobile phone but found it was missing. He said, ""You won't find it. I smashed it on the road"". When she asked him why, he replied, ""How many guys have you fucked since we've been together?"" He repeated the question, screaming as he pulled back the bed sheets. She told him, ""We're not together anymore"".

Sexual intercourse without consent

18The respondent took hold of the complainant's shorts and underwear and pulled them off. He held her ankles and pulled her down towards him. She was lying on her back and he held her legs in the air on either side of him. She asked him to let her go but he inserted two fingers into her anus which caused her pain. The penetration only lasted a couple of seconds. He said to her, ""this is what you want isn't it?"" She screamed at him to get off her. She struggled and he removed his fingers and moved to the side of the bed.

First assault occasioning actual bodily harm

19The complainant got off the bed and ran upstairs with a view to using the landline telephone. She was also yelling out, ""Help me please, it's unit eight, someone help me please"". The respondent ran past her and got to the phone dock first, pulling it out from the wall. He then struck her with a closed fist to the head, possibly causing her to lose consciousness. Her next awareness was being back on her bed with the respondent straddling her. He punched her with closed fists to the head a number of times. She screamed, ""Please help me, unit eight"" whilst trying to fight back. He placed a hand over her mouth and told her to stop screaming. She bit his hand. He responded by hitting her with closed fists at least twice.

Second assault occasioning actual bodily harm

20The complainant attempted to stand and run but the respondent took hold of her with his hands around her throat. She struggled and they both fell off the bed. A neighbour, having heard the complainant's screams, knocked on the door. The respondent called out, ""Everything's ok, everything's fine, go away"". But the complainant called out, ""Everything's not fine, kick the door in"". At this stage she was on her stomach with the respondent on top of her.

21He placed his hands around her neck and exerted pressure, making it hard for her to breathe. He then placed his right hand on her chin and his left hand behind her left ear and wrenched her head to the left. She heard a ""popping"" sound. He repeated this manoeuvre with more force and then again in the other direction about three times. The complainant described the pain as being ""immense"".

22The respondent then placed his right arm around her neck and under her chin, exerting pressure on her neck whilst pulling her head back. She struggled to breathe, her vision became blurry and she lost consciousness. He then released his grip and she began to regain consciousness. He said, ""You made me this person"".

23At the complainant's request, the respondent handed her a bottle of water and then escorted her to the bathroom. There she noted that her face was battered and swollen and there was blood coming from her nose and mouth. The respondent said, ""I can't believe I did this to you"" and offered to call the police and ambulance. He then said, ""I can't believe that I did this to you, you made me this person. I might as well slit my throat because my life is over"".

24The complainant put some clothes on and left the unit, saying she was going to look for the neighbour who had knocked on the door. As she entered the hallway she was met by neighbours who allowed her inside their unit. Police were summoned and spoke with her. They observed that she had significant bruising to her face and arms and bloodied eyes. She complained of having been sexually assaulted. She was taken to hospital.

25Police went to the respondent's unit where they met him at the door. He was arrested and taken to a police station. He agreed to be interviewed. He described confronting the complainant in her bedroom. He was asked about the amount of force he applied to her throat and he said, ""Not a major amount ... not enough to choke someone out but enough to be discomfort [sic]"". He said that she started ""choking"" and that he ""freaked"" and released his grip.

26Upon examination at hospital, it was found that the complainant's mouth was painful to open and there was bruising inside and outside the lip. There were widespread petechiae (I take this to mean spots of bleeding into the skin from broken blood vessels) over the face and neck and numerous bruises and abrasions about the head and neck. There was an area of red bleeding in the white sclera of the left eye and a red haematoma inside the right ear canal. There were also multiple bruises to both arms and on the chest, thorax and legs.

Do act with intent to pervert the course of justice

27The complainant and the respondent had shared a laptop computer which belonged to him. The complainant had email accounts that were password protected. She usually accessed those accounts on that laptop and used software on it to remember her login and password details.

28When the respondent was released on 19 May 2011, a condition of bail required that he live in Brisbane. In June or July 2011, the complainant noticed some irregular activity on one of her email accounts. There was an email in her ""sent items"" box addressed to the respondent which she had not sent. She immediately informed police.

29The respondent's trial was due to be held in the District Court in March 2012. Shortly before the trial date, his counsel, on instructions, forwarded to the Crown a series of emails purportedly from the complainant to the respondent. These emails expressed the complainant's love for the respondent; that she was happy he was in gaol; that she had lied to police; and that she had self-inflicted a particular injury that she had allegedly sustained in the assaults.

30The trial date was vacated so as to allow time for investigation. It was revealed that the respondent had accessed the complainant's email account on his laptop computer and had fabricated the emails. The emails had the potential to significantly compromise the complainant's credibility as a witness in the impending trial.

Subsequent assessments of the respondent's mental condition

31Documents from Justice Health were in evidence which detailed more history provided by the respondent and assessments made of his mental condition upon entering into Corrective Services custody after his arrest on 4 May 2011. They include that the recent paracetamol overdose ""was more an attempt to kill the pain in his leg/knee"" but that he admitted ""to having thoughts of depression over a long period of time"". Those thoughts included, ""'I'd be better off dead' but no plans of any kind were ever made."" Another note was that in relation to the overdose it was ""to help me sleep"". 

32The Justice Health notes also record an ""impression"" of there being an ""adjustment disorder with depressed mood"". The respondent was receiving antidepressant medication and his dosage was increased. A subsequent ""impression"" was of ""MDE"", which I understand to be shorthand for Major Depressive Episode, with a query as to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

33After the respondent had pleaded guilty, but before sentencing, he was assessed by Dr Gary Larder, a consultant psychiatrist at the University of Queensland. Dr Larder said in his report of 17 December 2012 that there was ""no doubt in my opinion that Mr Egan was assessed and correctly diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder in April and May 2011"". He said, ""He attempted suicide by overdose of medication which could have potentially fatal consequences in the way of liver failure"". I note that the history that he had ""attempted suicide"" is in conflict with what the respondent is recorded as having said to staff at the Royal Prince Alfred hospital, to Dr McDonald and to Justice Health staff. But I also note that the Crown did not object to the tender of Dr Larder's report, or require him to attend for cross-examination (AB 281).

34Dr Larder ""supported"" a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder at the relevant time. He described this as ""a severe reactive state of emotional, psychological and behaviour disturbance which arose at that time following Mr Egan's experience of a number of stressors which had accumulated and tested his coping mechanisms over a period of months"". He considered the diagnosis as being consistent with that made by Dr McDonald. 

35Dr Larder offered an opinion about a causal connection between the respondent's mental condition and his offending behaviour on 4 May 2011. I quote what he said about this when dealing with the first ground of appeal.

36Dr Larder noted that the respondent was on a regime of antidepressant medication and under the care of a consultant psychiatrist. He recommended that such treatment continue.

37A subsequent report by Dr Larder of 8 January 2013 supported the proposition that the respondent had good prospects of rehabilitation and an unlikelihood of re-offending if his current regime of treatment continued.

Other aspects of the respondent's subjective case

38An affidavit sworn by the respondent's mother was tendered without objection and it set out a number of aspects of the respondent's history, both before and after 4 May 2011. The prior history has been covered already. As to subsequent events, he returned to live with his family in Brisbane after being released on bail. He obtained employment as a chef in the latter part of 2011. He then took up employment as a steel salesman with an uncle and his mother anticipated that such employment would be available again ""once released from prison"". 

39The respondent met his current partner in November 2011. She came to live with him in the family home. She fell pregnant in about March 2012 and gave birth to their son in December 2012. She originated from El Salvador and had few family connections in Australia. But Ms Egan said her family was prepared to support the respondent's partner and his son until he was ""release[d] from prison"". 

40Ms Egan's affidavit included that after the respondent's arrest he was suspended from the Navy without pay. After an appeal, this was changed to suspension on half pay. But she understood that he would be discharged after being sentenced in January 2013.

41Finally, the affidavit referred to difficulties for the respondent being imprisoned in this State, with his family having limited opportunities to visit him for geographical and financial reasons.

42The respondent gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence in response to the judge expressing an interest in whether he was remorseful. He said that he was. He was asked about the fabricated emails. He said that at the time he created them his understanding was that ""if all this went away that I'd get back in the Navy and continue serving my country"". He could not recall the reason why he created the emails but said he was not intending to hurt anyone (AB 294-5). In cross-examination he agreed that he thought that by providing them to his barrister it would help his defence at trial. He did not realise that the police could do checks on computer systems to determine who had actually sent them (AB 298-9).

Proceedings leading up to sentencing

43The respondent appeared before his Honour Judge Bennett for what was to be his trial on its second listing on Monday 15 October 2012. The indictment at that time alleged offences of aggravated sexual assault; alternatively sexual assault; assault occasioning actual bodily harm; attempt to strangle with intent to murder; alternatively attempt to strangle with intent to sexually assault; and do an act with intent to pervert the course of justice. Submissions were made about a number of evidentiary issues requiring resolution before the trial commenced.

44Ultimately the matter came back before Bennett DCJ on Thursday 18 October. In the meantime the parties had negotiated and reached agreement that the respondent would plead guilty to the charges mentioned at the outset of this judgment. The Crown accepted such pleas in full satisfaction of the indictment and the proceedings were adjourned for sentence. Bail was continued, but counsel indicated, ""He knows he's going to gaol"" (AB 272).

45The sentence proceedings came before his Honour Judge Maiden on Tuesday 15 January 2013 when evidence and submissions were received before the judge reserved his decision until Monday 21 January 2013. 

Grounds of appeal

46The Crown relied upon seven grounds of appeal, one of which was abandoned at the hearing:

1.His Honour erred in holding that the Respondent had no control of himself by way of mental illness in the happening of Counts 1, 3 and 5A [the 4 May 2011 offences].

2.(Abandoned)

3.His Honour erred in extending a 25 per cent discount to the Respondent in respect of Counts 1, 2 and 3 [sic - the 4 May 2011 offences]

4.His Honour erred in his application of s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

5.His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences.

6.His Honour erred in failing to accumulate any of the sentences.

7.The sentences are individually, and as aggregated, manifestly inadequate.

Ground 1: No control because of a mental illness

47The judge referred three times in his sentencing remarks to his finding that the respondent had no control of himself at the time of the 4 May 2011 offences. He said:

I do find that at this time [the time of the first assault occasioning actual bodily harm] the offender had lost control of his emotions, and of his actions, in commencing and continuing the beating upon the complainant as he did. (Emphasis added) (AB 15-16)

In respect of the second assault occasioning matters, the choking, I make the similar finding from the last matter, that is that the offender had lost control, and was unable to stop his actions until what appears to be his anger had subsided. (Emphasis added) (AB 16)

On the night of this event [4 May 2011] ... and during the course of the assault it becomes clear to this Court on the facts that he was acting in a way that he had no control of by way of mental illness. (Emphasis added) (AB 21)

48The Crown argued that such findings were erroneous. The evidence of Drs McDonald and Larder indicated that the respondent suffered from an adjustment disorder. The respondent would not have had an ""inability"" to control his aggression, only a reduced capacity to do so. It was submitted for the Crown in oral argument that the judge's findings were tantamount to a finding of automatism. The Crown submitted that the correct approach would have been to acknowledge a reduced need for general deterrence and find special circumstances.

49The respondent argued that the judge's statements were simply findings that mental illness significantly contributed to the offending behaviour. Any differences in expression between that finding and what was actually said were submitted to be negligible. A discussion by the judge of Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 was said to be indicative of ""shorthand"" reference to the appropriate reduction in the importance of general deterrence, punishment and denunciation. The offending behaviour was out of character and unlikely to be repeated. It was also submitted that the respondent's psychiatric disorder would increase the burden of full-time custody.

50Dr Larder's opinion, which the judge fully accepted, was that:

The behaviour in which the events of 03 and 04 May 2011 led to the matters before The Court, is assessed as ""a loss of control over his anger and aggressive impulses"" which occurred as a reaction to the discovery of the breach of trust which had occurred ""behind his back"" in the context of the depressive illness diagnosed [one which reduced his capacity to control his aggressive impulses].

51Dr Larder's reference to a ""loss of control"" is qualified by the later reference to the respondent having a ""reduced capacity to control his aggressive impulses"". The sentencing judge failed to recognise the qualification. It is clear that the respondent acted in a way that was out of character. His mental condition provided some explanation for this. But finding that he had ""lost control"" and had ""no control"" overstated the situation. By his pleas of guilty, the respondent acknowledged that his actions were voluntary; that is they were conscious and willed acts: Ryan v The Queen (1967) 121 CLR 205. In relation to the sexual assault, he acknowledged that he knew at the time that what he did was without the complainant's consent.

52The manner in which the judge expressed his findings cannot be regarded as unintended or infelicitous. This Court readily acknowledges that judges of the District Court ""are faced on a daily basis with an almost unending onslaught of serious and complex sentencing exercises"": Tabuan v R [2013] NSWCCA 143 at [28] per Harrison J. And, as Spigelman CJ observed in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at [48], the conditions under which District Court judges give reasons for sentence ""are not such as to permit [them] to be parsed and analysed"". But the Chief Justice was talking about sentencing remarks delivered ex tempore. In the present case, the judge reserved so as to reflect upon the matter and the impugned finding was repeated.

53In my view, the error asserted in Ground 1 has been established.

Ground 2: Error in allowing 25 per cent discount for pleas of guilty to 4 May 2011 offences

54The judge allowed a 25 per cent discount for each of the 4 May 2011 offences on the basis that there was:

no dispute that the offender had been prepared, and was prepared, to plead guilty to the lesser charges, that is the charges which he has now pleaded, at the earliest time based upon what were the admissions given to police on the morning of the offence.
(AB 20)

55The Crown, relying upon R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32] and R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 at [5], argued on the appeal that 25 per cent was excessive given that the pleas of guilty were entered three days after the second trial date and that they were a result of charge negotiation. The Crown submitted that an appropriate discount for these three offences was 10 per cent.

56Rather than there being ""no dispute"" as the judge had said, the Crown Prosecutor had submitted that where there had been no offer to plead to any offence of violence or offence of a sexual nature until October 2012, the discount should not be as high as 25 per cent (AB 305). Counsel for the respondent had submitted to the judge that a discount of 12.5 per cent was appropriate for the sexual assault offence and 25 per cent for the other offences (AB 104; 108; 112; 114). 

57The respondent submitted that the circumstances that led to the late pleas were exceptional, especially in relation to the two assault offences, and justified a high discount despite the lack of utilitarian benefit. There had been an earlier offer to plead guilty to the first assault offence which the Crown had not accepted because it wished to persist with the prosecution of more serious charges.

58The respondent conceded that an appropriate discount for the sexual assault was not more than 10 per cent. But it was also submitted that the judge had not allowed as a further mitigating factor the saving of the complainant having to give evidence, and that this, in addition to the utilitarian value of the plea, warranted about the same level of mitigation of the sentence as the judge had assessed. For this reason, the error identified by the Crown was, in a practical sense, immaterial. The respondent placed reliance on R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, particularly at [119]-[121].

59It is difficult to understand how the judge could have allowed a 25 per cent reduction of the sentence for the sexual assault offence, particularly when it was clearly conceded by the respondent's counsel that a discount of half that magnitude was appropriate. Further, the plea was entered after the date of the second listing for trial. The respondent's concession in this Court that 10 per cent was appropriate should be accepted.

60The countervailing mitigating factor argued for the respondent concerning the saving of the complainant having to give evidence does not neutralise the impact of the judge's error. Saving witnesses from having to give evidence is something that is relevant to remorse: Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656 at [23]; R v Thomson; R v Houlton at [119]-[121]; R v Borkowski at [32]. The respondent received the benefit of a finding that he was remorseful. And in any event, the complainant faced the prospect of having to give evidence in March 2012 and again in October 2012 and was not relieved of that prospect until three days after the second trial date.

61It is true that the respondent made some admissions to police following arrest. It is also accepted that there was an offer to plead to one of the assault offences prior to the first trial listing, although it would seem that this was on a factual basis that the respondent had slapped the complainant (AB 245; 308). The fact remains, however, that no pleas were entered until 18 October 2012. The utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system was limited. The fact that the pleas followed charge negotiation did not change that: Borkowski at [32] at (9). There should not have been an allowance of any more than 10 per cent. 

62It follows that I would uphold ground 2.

Ground 5: Error in assessment of objective seriousness

63The judge found in relation to the sexual assault:

The complainant was not kept in hospital and after the forensic examination was discharged with her parents to go to their home. In respect to the sexual offence as I have indicated those facts in my mind puts it in the low category of sexual assault. ... In respect of the first matter, I have indicated that in my mind this is at the lower end of the range of seriousness. (AB 26; 28)

64He later said:

In respect of the two assault occasions, the second matter is at the higher end of the range. (AB 28)

65And finally:

The last matter, which is the perversion of justice, I should say, in my mind, is at the low end of the range, although the submissions of counsel were that it was a matter of great seriousness.
(AB 29)

66The Crown submitted that the judge's erroneous characterisation of the respondent's mental illness (see Ground 1) caused him to fail to appreciate the objective seriousness of the 4 May 2011 offences. The Crown also argued that the characterisation of the s 319 offence as ""at the low end of the range"" was incorrect. The commission of that offence struck at the heart of the criminal justice system, requiring a strongly deterrent sentence: R v Pangallo (1991) 56 A Crim R 441 at 443.

67The respondent argued that the judge's findings on objective seriousness should be viewed in the context of the findings of fact that accompanied them. In particular, the respondent drew attention to the preliminary remark that: 

When one looks at the assault matters one forms the conclusion that these were serious matters, and in terms of these matters the facts should be closely looked at in terms of the gravity of the three assault matters. (AB 15)

68It was submitted that the judge did not draw a causal connection between mental illness and the offending to reduce objective seriousness, but rather took the illness into account in considering the subjective circumstances.

69The respondent conceded that ""[d]isquiet as to the finding regarding objective seriousness...may arise more readily in connection with ground 6 than the others"", but submitted that the facts supported a finding of low seriousness, including the lack of a clear plan and the amateurish nature of the offending, and that in any event that this Court should be reluctant to intervene in the assessment: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282.

70It is possible in relation to the 4 May 2011 offences that the judge's erroneous exaggeration of the significance of the respondent's mental condition infected his assessment of their objective seriousness. But it is also possible that he adopted the approach suggested in this Court by the respondent's counsel. The reasoning is not sufficiently clear to determine this issue. Whilst minds might differ about the assessment, I do not believe that it can be said that the findings were not ones that were open to be made.

71The situation is different in relation to the s 319 offence. The finding of ""at the low end of the range"" was made in the face of the Crown submitting that it was ""well above mid range"" and the respondent's counsel submitting that it was ""middle to high range"". 

72The offence involved the multiple acts of the respondent creating the emails on nine different days in June 2011, then providing them to his barrister and instructing him to forward them to the Director of Public Prosecutions. They were clearly designed to be damaging to the credibility of the complainant. 

73The respondent said in his evidence that he was unaware that it would be possible for the police to investigate the integrity of the emails and determine their provenance. The actual impact of the offence was to have the first trial listing vacated and for a police investigation to be carried out. The respondent claimed in his evidence that he could not recall the reason why he created the emails but said that he was not intending to hurt anyone. But he also said that, at the time, his understanding was that ""if all this went away that I'd get back in the Navy and continue serving my country"" (AB 294-5). He said in cross-examination that he thought that by providing them to his barrister it would help his defence at trial (AB 298). 

74The actions of the respondent were intended to pervert the course of justice in respect of his trial for serious criminal offences. He was, in effect, seeking to bring about a miscarriage of justice for his own benefit. His actions might have been inept, and ultimately unsuccessful, but it is not the case that they had no actual impact on the course of justice and their potential impact was quite significant. In my view it was not open to regard the offence as ""at the low end of the range"".

75I would uphold this ground but only in respect of the s 319 offence.

Ground 4: Error in imposing suspended sentences 
Ground 6: Error in failing to accumulate sentences 
Ground 7: Manifest inadequacy

76These grounds are related and so it is appropriate to deal with them together.

77I do not propose to review the submissions of counsel in relation to the individual grounds. Suffice to say that the Crown contended for error in relation to each while Ms Rigg, valiantly it must be said, sought to support the correctness of the judge's approach, and the availability to him of imposing the sentences, despite there being some ""unfortunate"" aspects of the sentencing remarks.

Some principles relating to suspended sentences of imprisonment

78Before looking at how the judge approached these aspects of the sentencing exercise it is worth recalling some principles of sentencing in relation to suspended sentences that are well settled. The following is by no means exhaustive but they are principles relevant to the case at hand.

79There are three matters to be determined before a sentence of imprisonment can be suspended: first, whether no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate (s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) 1999 (NSW); secondly, if the answer to the first question is affirmative, the length of the sentence; thirdly, having regard to the length of the sentence, whether the sentence can, and should, be suspended. See, for example, Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154, per Johnson J at [69]-[72]. (A sentence of imprisonment can only be suspended if its length is not more than 2 years: s 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.) 

80An important issue in the decision to order suspension of the execution of a sentence of imprisonment is whether it would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 per Howie J at [28].

81It is erroneous to reduce the length of a sentence solely for the purpose of enabling its execution to be suspended: R v Ryan [2006] NSWCCA 394; 167 A Crim R 241 per Barr and Latham JJ at [2], [4]. That is a corollary of the proposition that it is impermissible to determine that the sentence should be suspended before determining its length: Burnard v R [2009] NSWCCA 5; 193 A Crim R 23 at [114]-[116]. 

82Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act does not apply when a sentence of imprisonment is suspended: s 12(3). Part 4 includes s 47, which provides for the commencement of sentences and a power to order that a sentence be served consecutively, or partly concurrently and partly consecutively, with some other sentence of imprisonment. It follows that there is no power to back-date or post-date a sentence of imprisonment that is suspended and, where there are multiple sentences to be imposed, there is no power to order any degree of accumulation.

83It follows that where a court is sentencing for multiple offences, it is necessary to have regard to what the overall term of the sentence should be before considering whether an alternative to full-time imprisonment is appropriate: Burnard v R at [111]. 

The sentencing judge's approach

84Remarks made by a judge prior to the delivery of judgment on sentence are seldom of use in identifying appellable error. It is accepted that in the exchanges with counsel in the course of submissions a judge will often express preliminary or tentative views that might not ultimately reflect the judge's concluded view: see, for example, the cases cited in Ghobrial v R [2012] NSWCCA 221 at [56]. 

85But the present case was rather extraordinary. The judge received all of the documentary material, including written submissions by counsel for the respondent, and retired to read it before the proceedings continued. The written submissions for the respondent included a concession that a full-time custodial sentence should be imposed, and that after a suggested (erroneously generous) reduction by 25 per cent for the 4 May 2011 offences, there should be an overall term of imprisonment of 3 years and 9 months.

86After having read the material, and before hearing much else, the judge inquired whether it was worth having the respondent assessed for an intensive corrections order (ICO). A ICO is an alternative to full-time imprisonment and only available if it has been determined that the total sentence should be not more than 2 years: s 7 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Counsel for the respondent answered, ""No your Honour"". The Crown Prosecutor answered likewise (AB 286). 

87Later, when the Crown Prosecutor told the judge that an ICO was unavailable because a prescribed sexual assault offence was involved (s 66), the judge raised the possibility of deferring sentence pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or suspending the execution of sentences (AB 290; 292). This was all at the judge's initiative. No-one was suggesting it and it was only at the end of the proceedings that counsel for the respondent relented and embraced the judge's suggested approach (AB 309).

88Relevant to the present three grounds of appeal, at a late stage of his sentencing remarks he said:

The difficulty that this Court faces is this, that in terms of having an intensive corrections order, because of the sexual nature of the first matter to which he has pleaded, that particular option is not available. In respect of home detention, because he is living in Queensland and will continue to do so hopefully, that option is not available. Which leaves the Court considering [a] full time custodial sentence or dealing with the matter by way of suspended sentence. Clearly this matter calls for a gaol sentence. The question is whether the matter should be dealt with pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I am of the view that it should, and although, despite my urgings, the Crown has not acceded to that view, I propose to deal with this matter as I indicated pursuant to s 12. (AB 29)

89The judge had not given any inkling up until this point that he had determined what the length of the sentences, and the overall sentence, should be. I can only interpret his Honour's remarks as indicating that he wanted to impose something other than full-time imprisonment, and was searching to find a way to achieve that end. 

90After the remarks quoted above, the judge referred to some aspects of the s 319 offence and then continued: 

In that matter, I propose, bearing in mind his plea of guilty, for which I allowed twenty-five per cent, to impose a sentence of thirteen and a half months. That sentence, because it is s 12, must start from today, but I discount from that time a period of fourteen days, being the period of time that he served in custody before being released to bail on 19 May 2011.

In respect of [the] three other matters, I am of the view that the sentences of imprisonment should be imposed but they should be suspended pursuant to s 12. (AB 29-30)

91Having determined that the sentence for each offence should be suspended, necessarily involving that there be no accumulation, his Honour immediately, and to my mind curiously, proceeded to say:

The Court needs to consider whether those sentences should be imposed concurrently or aggregated in some way. Having considered the matter I propose that they be served effectively together, and that each of them will be for a period of twenty-two months to date from today. In doing so, there is some mathematical inconsistency in my reasons, taking into account the twenty-five per cent discount. However, looking at the totality of the matters, I believe it is appropriate that those three assault matters be dealt with, as I have indicated, together and that also the matter relating to the perversion of justice also date from today. I do this in circumstances where I have no alternative but to commence the use of s 12 from today, and it only applies to matters of sentence of two years or less, and I do so. (AB 30)

92This sentencing exercise miscarried. The judge decided to suspend the sentences before determining their length. There was a failure to do what was obvious in the circumstances, to impose partially accumulated sentences. And, in any event, the individual sentences, and the total effective sentence, were manifestly inadequate. A total effective 22-month suspended sentence utterly failed to bear any relationship to the objective seriousness of the offences and the various purposes of sentencing.

Re-sentencing 

93It was submitted by Ms Rigg for the respondent that this Court should exercise its discretion not to intervene on the basis that doing so would disrupt the progress that he had made towards rehabilitation: Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462. 

94An affidavit by the respondent confirms the progress he has made in terms of the assistance he has received in respect of his mental condition. Further, he has employment; his family life is settled; and there would be significant, although not exceptional, financial and family hardship if he is sentenced to imprisonment. 

95This case demonstrates the unfortunate consequences that flow from a judge being unduly merciful in imposing a sentence that is substantially less than that which the law demands and that the judge's duty requires be imposed. Unpalatable as it is, it is the duty of this Court to rectify the significant errors of the primary judge by re-sentencing.

96The respondent should have the full benefit of the favourable findings made by the judge as to his prior good character, remorse, good prospects of rehabilitation and unlikelihood of re-offending. There should also be a finding of special circumstances, which the Crown conceded, to justify a non-parole period of the overall term that is less than the usual proportion (s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). An extended period of parole supervision will further the respondent's rehabilitation which is likely to require additional focus after he has served a period in custody.

97The sentences for the 4 May 2011 offences will be less than they otherwise should be on account of the reduced need to factor in general deterrence in the assessment because of the respondent's mental condition at the time. That consideration does not arise in relation to the s 319 offence; it was committed between May 2011 and March 2012 when the severity of the mental condition had subsided.

98The respondent's affidavit indicates the level of supervision by the Probation and Parole authorities in Queensland to which he has been subject since the imposition of sentence and there is no question about his compliance and co-operation. He should be given credit for the time that he has been subject to the s 12 good behaviour bond since 21 January 2013. The respondent should also receive credit for the 16 days he spent in custody between his initial arrest and being released on bail. The sentence will accordingly date from 5 January 2013.

99The sentences should be partially accumulated to reflect the different degrees and types of criminality, although the sentences for the two assault offences should be concurrent amongst themselves. The intention is to impose an overall sentence that appropriately reflects the totality of criminality: the relevant principles were set out by Hall J in R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38 at [52].

100It is permissible to decline to set a non-parole period where no standard non-parole period is prescribed: s 45 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I propose to adopt that approach where there would be no utility in setting a non-parole period. 

101The sentence for the s 319 offence should be reduced by 25 per cent on account of the utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system for a plea of guilty entered at an early opportunity. The pleas of guilty for the 4 May 2011 offences were late and had limited utilitarian benefit; the reduction should be 10 per cent. To achieve a practical result there will be some rounding but to the respondent's benefit.

Orders

102I propose the following orders. They will have the effect that the respondent will be sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 4 years and 2 months with a minimum custodial component of 2 years 8 months. 

Crown appeal allowed.

Sentences imposed in the District Court quashed.

Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (count 3): sentenced to imprisonment for 10 months with no non-parole period. The sentence is to date from 5 January 2013 and expire on 4 November 2013.

Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (count 5A): sentenced to imprisonment for 1 year 9 months with no non-parole period. The sentence is to date from 5 January 2013 and expire on 4 October 2014.

Sexual intercourse without consent (count 2): sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of the term of the sentence of 8 months. The sentence is to date from 5 September 2013. The non-parole period expires on 4 September 2015 and the total term expires on 4 May 2016.

Do act with intent to pervert the course of justice (count 6): sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year and a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year and 6 months. The sentence is to date from 5 September 2014. The respondent is to be released on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 4 September 2015. The total term of the sentence will expire on 4 March 2017. 

103BUTTON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2706275,R v Smith [2013] NSWSC 1159,"Judgment

1Richard Keith Smith today stands for sentence for the murder of Stanley Bruce Davies at Kempsey on 26 November 2010. He pleaded guilty to that offence in this Court in February 2013, after he was committed for trial from the Port Macquarie Local Court.

The Court's sentencing task

2It is necessary to begin by giving some explanation of the sentencing task which the Parliament has imposed on the Court. The sentence imposed on the offender must reflect the gravity of the offence which he has committed, viewed objectively (see R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354). 

3In arriving at that sentence the Court must bear in mind the purposes of sentencing specified in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ('the Act'). Those purposes are: 

""(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
(c) to protect the community from the offender, 
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community."" 


4The sentence must be fixed in light of the maximum penalty imposed for the crime in question, which in the case of the offence of murder, is life imprisonment under s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900. 

5Section 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires that a sentence of life imprisonment be imposed on an offender, if the Court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme, that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence. It is a matter for the Crown to establish that an offence falls within s 61(1). In this case the Crown did not seek the imposition of such a sentence, submitting that this offence did not fall into the worst category of such offences. 

6By s 54A of the Act, the Parliament has also imposed a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment for an offence of murder falling in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of such offences. A non-parole period is the minimum period that an offender will serve in prison, before being eligible to be released on parole for the balance of the sentence imposed for the offence.

7Both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period are factors which must be taken into account on sentencing, in the way explained by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120, even in a case such as this, where a plea has been entered.

8Under s 22 of the Act, a plea of guilty must also be taken into account in determining sentence. Under s 21A of the Act the Court is also required to give consideration to specified aggravating and mitigating factors revealed by the evidence, as well as any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence. Consideration must be given to general and specific deterrence in the sentence imposed. The sentence imposed must ensure that there is a reasonable proportionality between the sentence and the circumstances of the crime committed (see R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [15]). 

9The sentencing exercise must also have regard to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which requires that the balance of the term of the sentence imposed must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances. If there is to be any such adjustment, it must not be such as to reduce the non-parole period below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve for the offence he has committed (see Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628).

The Evidence 

10In this case the parties agreed on the facts by way of a document entitled 'Summary of Facts'. The Crown also tendered the offender's criminal history, as well as a statement made by Dr Peter Ackerley, who attended Mr Davies when he was admitted to Kempsey District Hospital Emergency Department; a statement of Dr William Saul, who treated Mr Davies when he was transferred to John Hunter Hospital, where he died on 26 November 2010; an autopsy report of 18 November 2011; and parts of a statement of Senior Constable Gane, who conducted a forensic investigation of Mr Davies' home, which commenced on 20 November 2010. A number of photographs were attached to that statement.

11The offender did not give evidence. In his case a report of a clinical psychologist, Ms Michelle Player, of 1 July 2013 was tendered, as well as two letters from his family members, Mr Gray and Ms Smith.

The parties' cases

12By his plea the offender accepted that he is guilty of Mr Davies' murder. The offender did not ask the Court to distinguish between him and his co-offenders, notwithstanding that he had told the psychologist that he had only hit Mr Davies. He accepted his responsibility for that murder, including acceptance of his responsibility for the acts of his co-offenders.

13It was submitted for the offender, however, that the Court would find that the evidence established only that he had the intention to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr Davies, not that he had a specific intention to kill. The Crown's case was that the evidence established at least that there was an intention to inflict really serious bodily harm. 

14On the Crown's case this offence fell above the middle of the range of such offences, the evidence establishing that it had involved a sustained and vicious attack on an elderly man, who should have been safe in his own home, who was obviously not giving his attackers what they wanted and who had been attacked, purely for personal gain. The offender's case was that while it was accepted that his offence was a very serious one, it would be found to fall within the middle of the range. 

15It was common ground that the offender must have a discount for his plea, the Crown submitting, however, that the range fell between 13 and 17% and the offender, that it fell between 15 and 18%. There was also some disagreement as to the date from which the sentence should commence, having regard to the time that the offender has spent in custody after his arrest, which was referrable to the sentence in respect of which he was on parole, when Mr Davies was murdered. That sentence expired on 3 November 2011, after which the offender has been in custody in respect of this offence alone. 

16There was also a question lying between the parties as to how the assessment of special circumstances might be approached in this case, given the offender's personal circumstances and the sentence likely to be imposed upon him. 

The seriousness of this offence

17As I have explained, the maximum sentence of life imprisonment is reserved for extreme offences of murder. This was explained in R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448, where it was observed at [60]:

""Because the life sentence provided by s.61 of that Act does not contemplate any prospect of relief in the future, no matter how distant, it should be reserved for crimes of the utmost heinousness: Chung [1999] NSWCCA 330, Ibbs v. R. (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-2, Twala NSWCCA 4/11/94, Fernando (1997) 95 A Crim R 553 at pars.344-4, Harris at 423.""


18In this case, on the evidence I am satisfied that the Crown's submission as to the objective seriousness of this offence must be accepted. This was a very serious example of murder, involving as it did an elderly victim, viciously attacked at night while alone in his own home, where he was left to suffer a lingering death.

19The evidence unquestionably reveals that objectively, this was a very serious offence, falling somewhat above the mid-range of such offences. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that while this was clearly a very serious example of murder, as the offender himself accepted, the parties' common ground that the evidence established that this is not a case of the most extreme kind, for which a life sentence must be imposed, has to be accepted. 

20On 19 November 2010 Mr Davies was aged 75 years. A friend visited Mr Davies at his home at about 6pm that evening. He was then uninjured. 

21Like Mr Davies, the three co-offenders were all locals living in Kempsey. In the early hours of that evening one of them left his home, saying that he was going to see the offender to have a drink and that the offender had a house, which he intended to rob. 

22At about midnight Mr Davies' neighbours heard banging sounds. It was at about that time that the three offenders entered Mr Davies' house, intending to steal property there. As he entered, the offender injured his head. It began to bleed. On later forensic examination, blood which matched the offender's DNA profile was found at the house. 

23The offenders confronted Mr Davies inside the house, subjecting him to violence of the most awful kind, in which the offender accepts that he was an active participant. They demanded the opening of, or the combinations to Mr Davies' safes, without success. They ransacked the house, forcing open and attempting to force open safes and other security containers. Mr Davies was moved about the house while injured, leaving a blood trail. 

24Mr Davies was only discovered after 5.30pm the next day, 20 November. He was not found until his sister and brother contacted police, after his sister had entered the house to find that the lounge room had been ransacked. He was then found lying on the ground in a bedroom, between the bed and a cupboard, unconscious and severely injured, covered in blood, the surrounding area covered in his blood, with considerable impact blood spatter nearby.

25The evidence established that Mr Davies had been struck with both fists and weapons in such a way that he suffered a compression injury to his neck, as well as multiple fractures to his facial bones, bleeding to his face and within his brain, lacerations behind his right ear, as well as patterned injuries to his back, consistent with an assault caused by an implement such as a tyre lever or the shaft of a golf club, as well as bruising to his upper arms and abrasion to his fingers. 

26On admission to hospital Mr Davies was found to have extensive swelling to his head and face, as well as bruising, consistent with multiple blows from a blunt object and extensive brain damage, which was considered to be irretrievable and unlikely to respond to surgery.

27Despite the treatment which he received at Kempsey Hospital and later after he was transferred to John Hunter Hospital, Mr Davies failed to respond. He remained in a coma until life support was withdrawn on 26 November, when he died. On forensic examination it was concluded that his injuries were consistent with a severe, violent and sustained assault to his face, neck and head. The cause of his death was determined to be craniofacial trauma.

28On all of this evidence, it is beyond question that this offence involved a cowardly attack on an elderly man, late at night, while he was alone in his own home, where he should have been safe from harm. The three offenders inflicted terrible injuries upon him, using both their fists and implements, when he refused to open the safes and other sealed containers which they were intent on robbing. The evidence clearly establishes that these injuries were inflicted, at least, with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. 

29The offender did not give evidence. What he told the psychologist was not the subject of cross-examination and so must be approached with some caution in this sentencing exercise. Given what other evidence has revealed about the nature and extent of the injuries inflicted on Mr Davies, it seems to me that the account which the offender gave the psychologist cannot be accepted as having been entirely accurate, as to all that occurred that night. 

30The offender told the psychologist that while he was affected by drugs and alcohol at the time of the offence, he could generally recall his actions. He said that Mr Davies was awake, sitting at a table when they entered his home. He admitted hitting Mr Davies with his fists. He said that this physical force was intended to scare Mr Davies ""so that things could be easier, calmer to do things"", by which the psychologist understood him to mean that the robbery could progress smoothly. The offender also said that he did not do or say anything to stop the other violence inflicted by his co-offenders. 

31The offender did tell the psychologist that ""I hate that the fella is dead. That was one thing that wasn't meant to happen. I wish it never happened at all"". He also said that he thought about Mr Davies' death every night and that he feels ""like shit"" about it.

32There was no evidence that the offender hit Mr Davies with an implement. In the result, I have concluded that the evidence does not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had formed the intention to kill Mr Davies, or that it was the offender who used the implement or implements which caused certain of Mr Davies' extensive, serious injuries. It follows that while accepting his legal responsibility for the acts of his co-offenders, the offender must be sentenced on the basis that his moral culpability for the injuries inflicted on Mr Davies encompassed only those injuries inflicted by use of his own fists. 

33Nevertheless, that the offender gave the psychologist an entirely accurate or complete account of his involvement in the assault to which Mr Davies was subjected, does not follow. 

34Given the nature and extent of the injuries which he suffered, that the violence which the offender admitted he inflicted on Mr Davies was intended only to scare him and to make the robbery calmer and easier, as he told the psychologist, cannot be accepted. The extent of the injuries which Mr Davies suffered establishes that it was an extreme level of violence which caused his lingering, awful death. What he experienced before he fell into the coma from which he never recovered, must have been both terrifying and painful. What he had to endure was certainly neither calm nor easy.

35In assessing the seriousness of this offence it is also necessary to consider that the consequences of the severe beating to which Mr Davies had been subjected and his resulting need for urgent medical attention, must have been apparent to the offender, when he and his co-offenders left Mr Davies to die. It was then late at night. He was an elderly man, who had been seriously injured, while alone in his home. Still the offender did nothing to seek the assistance which Mr Davies so desperately then needed. Instead, this helpless, seriously injured elderly man was callously abandoned to his fate. 

36That no doubt helps explain the guilt which the offender told the psychologist that he continues to feel for Mr Davies' death and puts beyond argument the objective seriousness of the offence for which this offender must now be sentenced.

Aggravating factors

37The various aggravating factors specified in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which it was agreed by the parties were relevant to this sentencing exercise are:


(c) the use of a weapon;


(e) that the offence was committed in company;


(eb) that it was committed in the victim's home;


(j) that it was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty while on parole; and


(l) that the victim was vulnerable, given his age.


38As was submitted for the Crown, only factor (j), that the offender was on conditional liberty while on parole, is a factor not already encompassed by an assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence. 

39The explanation given by the offender to the psychologist was that he was motivated to break into Mr Davies' house, because he was under the influence of heroin, cannabis and alcohol. He required money to fund his drug use. As the Crown submitted, that account reveals the nature and extent of the offender's breaches of the parole which he had been granted, for his earlier offending. Mr Davies' murder was unquestionably a further breach of that parole, of the most serious kind possible. 

40In the result, that this offence was committed only a little more than a month after the offender was released on parole is a matter necessarily to be taken into account by way of aggravation of this offence. 

Mitigating factors

41The parties also agreed that the mitigating matters specified in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act relevant to take into account on sentencing were the offender's plea, to which I will return and perhaps remorse. 

42Section 21A(3)(i) provides that remorse shown by an offender for an offence, can only be taken into account if: 

""(i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and 

(ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)"" 


43It is relevant in this context to consider the evidence of the circumstances of the offender's arrest, the entry of his plea, which itself may be accepted as evidencing remorse, and the other evidence which sheds light on the offender having such remorse. 

44It was not in issue that the offender has limited intellectual capacity, but there was no suggestion that he was incapable of understanding his offending. 

45The offender's phone services were lawfully intercepted by police, between 1 and 5 December 2010. In phone conversations then recorded the offender's mother spoke to him about surrendering to police. He also discussed with her his probable sentence. After DNA identification of his blood, on execution of a search warrant on 8 December 2012, the offender was found hiding in a cupboard at premises where his two co-offenders were also present. He was then arrested and charged. After arrest he admitted his involvement in the murder, to a fellow inmate. On 13 December the offender also discussed the circumstances of the offence with two other inmates. 

46The two co-offenders were arrested and charged with murder in June and July 2012, after they also allegedly had made admissions as to their involvement. They are both awaiting trial. It was in 2013 that the offender admitted his guilt by entry of his plea. That was plainly not motivated by the course which the other offenders have taken. 

47The psychologist found that the offender did not display any mood or psychomotor disturbance; that his thought processes were logical and coherent in theory and content; and that there was no evidence of thought disorder, delusional thinking, or hallucinatory experiences. There were no reported mental health problems, apart perhaps from certain anger management issues. The offender was, however, assessed to have limited intellectual skills, commensurate with reported school difficulties, early cessation of formal schooling, lack of formal qualifications and failure to progress to structured employment.

48In the light of that assessment, it seems to me that it must be accepted that the offender has limited ability to verbalise the sentiment of remorse. Taking this limitation into account, I am satisfied that there is evidence that the offender has accepted responsibility for his actions, and has acknowledged the injury and loss which he has caused. 

49That was established by what the offender said about his offence to another inmate after his arrest; by the later entry of his plea; and by what he later told the psychologist of his regret at Mr Davies' death. He then said that it had not been meant to happen, that he wished it had not happened; and that he thought about it, every night. The psychologist considered that what the offender had told her did evidence his remorse. 

50Real remorse was also reflected in his acceptance on sentencing, that he had responsibility for the acts of his co-offenders, as well as for his own acts. It was also revealed by the letters written by Mr Gray and Ms Smith, who are both in contact with the offender. He still has the support of family members and friends in the community, who have not given up on him and will support him on release. Both Mr Gray and Ms Smith believe what the offender has told them, that he regrets what has happened. He has also told Ms Smith of his sorrow at Mr Davies' death. 

51These accounts are consistent with the other evidence I have referred to, which in my assessment, do provide a basis for accepting that there is real remorse on the offender's part for the death that he has caused.

The offender's personal circumstances

52Consideration must also be given to the evidence of the offender's personal circumstances.

53The offender is an aboriginal man, who was aged some 27 years at the time of his offence. He is now aged some 30 years. As I have explained, he is a man of limited intelligence, with a long history of alcohol and drug abuse. He also has a considerable criminal record.

54The account which he gave the psychologist was that he had been born and raised in Kempsey. His parents were both of Aboriginal ethnicity. He was their only child. Their relationship broke down when he was aged 5 years. He did not know the reason, having no memory of any discord between them. His mother then raised him alone until he was 12 years of age. He had a good relationship with her, but had no ongoing contact with his father. 

55The offender's mother formed a new relationship when he was around 12 years old. He has three siblings from this relationship. He initially had a strained relationship with his stepfather, who was involved in alcohol and cannabis abuse. He had regular verbal arguments and two physical fights with his stepfather, before their relationship improved when he was aged 15 years.

56The offender reported being an uncontrollable child, negatively influenced by cousins and peers. He suffered certain physical abuse from his mother, who struggled to place limits on his behaviour. He regularly absconded from home after the age of 12 or 13, but otherwise resided at home. 

57The offender disliked education and struggled with reading. He truanted from school and in year 8 transferred to TAFE, which he attended for approximately two years. He never obtained any formal school qualifications and had no experience of employment. 

58Remarkably, the offender had no health problems, despite a history of significant substance abuse from age 13, when he commenced smoking cannabis. He soon began smoking a combination of cannabis and heroin daily, until he began serving a custodial sentence when aged 20. He reported that he had engaged in thieving, in order to support this habit. 

59The offender abstained from drugs while in custody and for some two years after release, but then engaged in alcohol abuse. This resulted in one to two day episodes of binge drinking, about twice weekly. He then resumed his criminal activities, behaving aggressively when intoxicated.

60In 2006, while drug free, after release from custody, the offender entered a relationship, which produced a child. The relationship deteriorated and from November 2008 he returned to smoking cannabis and heroin daily and also engaged in episodes of excessive alcohol use. There was domestic violence, with the result that the relationship dissolved in 2009. He had seen his daughter only once, since she was aged eight weeks.

61The offender has in the past completed drug and alcohol programs while in custody and, between 2006 and 2008, participated in a residential rehabilitation project at The Haven in Lismore. He left after three weeks, because he did not consider that he had an alcohol problem. He also had about three months of individual counselling in the community.

62The offender accepted that in sentencing, his subjective circumstances had a smaller role to play than the seriousness of his offending. It was also accepted that his drug taking and alcohol abuse did not mitigate his offence, but it was submitted that it provided some explanation as to the circumstances in which it came to be committed.

Deterrence

63The circumstances of this offence and the offender's personal circumstances are such that there can be no question that both general and specific deterrence must feature in the sentence which is imposed. 

64The offender has a considerable criminal record dating back to 1997. There are repeated stealing, break and enter, destroying property, drug, robbery, assault, stalking and driving offences. He was at liberty on parole for only a month when he murdered Mr Davies, while attempting to rob him, in order to support his drug habit. 

65The psychologist was of the opinion that having in mind the reservations which she explained as to risk assessment and risk management, that the offender presented a moderate to high risk of violent recidivism. She identified various risk management factors, including the offender's prior violence and multiple vulnerabilities. She concluded that the offender's main recidivism risks were a relapse to his previous pattern of alcohol and drug misuse upon release, entrenched antisocial attitudes, and anger and aggression problems. 

66Participation in the Violent Offender Treatment Program and drug and alcohol programs whilst in custody were recommended, as was a DAS program for depression, anxiety and stress. A long term residential rehabilitation program was also recommended on release, as well as regular drug screening and motivational counselling, to ease the offender's eventual transition back into the community. The psychologist considered that this should be supported by a lengthy period of supervision by the Community Offender Service, to ensure that the offender had stable accommodation on release and was avoiding drug and alcohol using peers. He would also require employment assistance. 

67In the face of this evidence it is apparent that the sentences which have been imposed upon the offender in the past, have not provided the necessary deterrence to bring his continuing offending to an end. To the contrary, the seriousness of his offending has escalated. 

68Given his history and the obvious serious risk of re-offending which the offender poses, once released, it follows that in this case specific deterrence must have a considerable role to play in the sentence which is imposed on the offender, in order to drive home the need for him to bring his repeated, violent offending to an end. 

Discount on sentence for the guilty plea

69It was common ground that it is within my discretion to grant the offender a discount for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty, in accordance with the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgment in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 

70The purpose of such a utilitarian discount was there explained by the Chief Justice as reflecting the benefits which flow from a guilty plea for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole, as well as to witnesses and victims, who, as the result of such a plea, are spared having to give evidence and the personal rumination of traumatic events, which is inevitably involved in that process. A trial judge must identify these benefits when sentencing, in order to provide an incentive to offenders to enter such a plea, so that such benefits will, in fact, be derived (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton at [115] to [123]).

71This plea was not entered at the earliest opportunity and so the maximum discount of 25% is not available to the offender. It was, however, entered before a hearing before a jury was scheduled. It follows that many of the benefits which the Chief Justice discussed in R v Thomson; R v Houlton have flown in this case, from the entry of the plea. 

72In the result I have concluded that the offender should have a discount of 18%, to reflect those benefits.

Comparable cases

73A number of other cases were relied on, in order to support the offender's submissions that the objective seriousness of his offence falls within the middle of the range and that the Court would not impose the standard non-parole period of 20 years. It was also submitted that the Court would have regard to:

1. the absence of a specific intention to kill;

2. the offenders not being armed upon arrival, entering Mr Davies' home with an intention to steal/rob;

3. the plea of guilty; and

4. the offender's youth.


74Care must always be taken in making comparisons with other decided cases, given the very differing factual circumstances with which each of those cases were concerned. The offender must be sentenced on the basis of what the evidence establishes in his case. 

75The authorities relied on provided but little assistance in the sentencing exercise. They reflected sentences ranging from 27 years, with a non-parole period of 18 years, after a trial, to 16 years, with a non-parole period for 12 years, after a plea. They also dealt with circumstances quite different to those which have arisen to be dealt with in this case. 

76True it is that I have concluded that the evidence does not establish that the offender had an intention to kill. As discussed in the authorities, however, whether there was an intention to kill is an important question in an assessment of where a murder lies in the range of objective gravity, but of itself is not necessarily determinative. There may be circumstances where an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm can reflect similar criminality to cases involving an intention to kill. All of the relevant circumstances must be weighed in the balance in arriving at an appropriate sentence for the particular offence for which a sentence is being imposed (see for example the discussion in Tran v R [2011] NSWCCA 116 by Hidden J at [39] and Johnson J at [44] - [45]).

77Those circumstances included that the offender was an adult in 2010 when he committed this most serious of offences, albeit he was then aged only 27 years. At that relatively young age he already had an extensive criminal record, which dated back to 1997. It was a record of increasing seriousness, which included an earlier break, enter and assault. In the result, it seems to me that the offender's age can be given but little weight in this sentencing exercise. 

78There was no evidence that the offenders were not armed when they broke into Mr Davies' home. Whether they were then armed or not, was not dealt with in the evidence. What must be considered in this regard is that on the offender's own account to the psychologist, he was certainly prepared to use violence, in order to achieve his aim in that break in. 

79In my assessment, having considered all of the matters which must be weighed in the balance, I have come to the view that the evidence establishes that this was an offence which was somewhat more serious than the mid-range of such offences. The result of this sentencing exercise will, however, be a non-parole period below the standard 20 years fixed for such an offence, reflective of the 18% discount which I have determined the offender must receive for his plea.

Special circumstances

80The offender submitted that special circumstances would be found in his case, even though he had previously re-offended, when given liberty on parole. This was because his need for assistance on release would not be obviated by a lengthy sentence and that a period of lengthy supervision would be required, in order that his successful rehabilitation be promoted. It was argued that this would be not only to his benefit, but also that of the community, participation in necessary rehabilitation programs and the benefit of a long period of supervision, reducing the risk of his further recidivism.

81Despite these submissions, I am of the view that there should not be any finding of special circumstances in this case. 

82It is apparent from all of the evidence that this offence is but the latest and most serious in a long series of offences, in which the seriousness of the criminality involved has escalated to the most serious of all offences, murder. Apart from the entry of his plea and the remorse which I have accepted the offender has shown, there is little in the evidence which suggests that the offender does not present a considerable risk of further offending in the future.

83To the contrary, the psychologist's assessment is that the offender poses a moderate to high risk of violent re-offending. 

84What the offender said led the psychologist to consider that while he did have a degree of remorse, that ""he endorsed an attitude that seemingly condoned instrumental violence""; that there were multiple risk factors which remained unaddressed; and that they raised the risk that the offender would re-offend in a violent manner.

85I am satisfied that the evidence established a proper basis for those assessments. This offender plainly presents a considerable risk that he will engage in further violent offending, once released.

86On the basis of his history, the psychologist recommended as long a period of supervision in the community as possible for this offender. She considered it unlikely that there would be much change in the offender's behaviour, until the dynamics underlying his offending behaviour were addressed. Given the risk of further offending which he presented, the psychologist was strongly of the view that the offender requires a considerable period of close supervision, when released into the community. 

87When the offender is likely to be released, will depend in part on the advantage which the offender takes of the opportunity available to him in custody, to successfully pursue programs which will assist in reducing his risk of re-offending, when released, particularly through abstinence from drugs and alcohol. Those steps lie in the offender's hands.

88On the evidence, he will certainly require the closest and most careful supervision, whenever he is released, given the nature of his record, the seriousness of this offence and the obvious risk which he presents of further violent offending, once released. 

89In my assessment, however, given the sentence necessarily to be imposed upon him, the result of the statutory ratio will provide such a period of supervision. In the result, there is no need for any finding of special circumstances. 

Victim Impact Statement

90From what I have said about the circumstances of Mr Davies' death, it will be apparent that no matter what is said by the Court in these sentencing remarks, but small comfort will thereby be given to Mr Davies' family and friends.

91At the sentencing hearing in Newcastle, with the support of her remaining brothers, Mr Davies' sister read a victim impact statement to the Court, explaining the sorrow, loss and anger which they each deeply felt. It would only detract from what was then said, if I attempted to summarise that statement. I am sure that no one present was untouched by those remarks and the dignity with which they were conveyed. 

92For my own part I extend to all of Mr Davies' family and friends, my deepest sympathy for their loss and his terrible suffering.

93Mr Davies' family will understand that I may not take this unsworn, untested victim impact statement into account in sentencing the offender, for reasons which I am sure have been explained to them, by reference to the decided cases which I must follow. 

94Nevertheless, I do hope that they may be given some peace of mind by an understanding of what the evidence has revealed about how Mr Davies came to be murdered and how our society has dealt and is continuing to deal with that awful crime.

The sentence

95Having considered all of the matters I have mentioned, I have concluded that the sentence for this offence must commence on 3 November 2011, the expiry date of the sentence for the offence for which the offender was on parole, when this offence was committed. 

96I do not consider that the circumstances warrant that any part of the sentence for this offence, should be made concurrent with the sentence imposed for the offender's earlier offence. The two offences were entirely unrelated. That the offender had to serve the entirety of the balance of his earlier sentence, having committed this further serious offence while at liberty on parole, is the natural consequence of his breach of that parole. As recently observed in R v Allen [2013] NSWCCA 173 at [19], the offender should not expect otherwise, particularly given the nature of the breach of his parole involved in the circumstances of Mr Davies' murder.

97Account must, however, be taken of the fact that the offender has been in continuous custody since 3 November 2011. That period is not concerned with any other offending. Accordingly, the date of the sentence for this offence will commence on that day.

98But for the 18% discount, I would have imposed a sentence of 28 years on this offender. With the discount, the total term of his imprisonment will be 22 years, 11 months. The application of the statutory ratio results in a non-parole period of 17 years, 2 months and a balance of term of 5 years, 9 months. The result is that the earliest date that the offender will be eligible for release is 2 January 2029. That will depend on him convincing the Parole Authority that he should be then released on parole. His sentence will expire on 2 October 2034.

2706285,Adegoke v R [2013] NSWCCA 193,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: I agree that the orders proposed by Fullerton J should be made, for the reasons she gives.

2FULLERTON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed in the District Court on 16 December 2011 after pleading guilty in the Local Court on 22 June 2011 to three offences, two laid contrary to the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (""the Criminal Code"") and the third contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The State offence was the subject of a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).

3The offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty and the sentences imposed are as follows: 

1. Between about 28 January 2010 and 9 February 2010 he attempted to possess a marketable quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug, namely 86.2 grams of cocaine and contrary to s 307.6(1) with s 11.1(1) of the Criminal Code (""the drug offence"").

2. Between about 1 June 2009 and 9 February 2010 he dealt with the proceeds of crime in the amount of $387,241 contrary to s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code (""the proceeds of crime offence"").

3. On 9 February 2010 he had custody of a false instrument, namely a New South Wales driver's licence in the name of Simon Wells with intent to use the licence contrary to s 302 of the Crimes Act (""the false instrument offence"").

4Against an incorrectly nominated maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment for the proceeds of crime offence (the correct maximum penalty being imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of $132,000) a sentence of 5 years imprisonment was imposed. That sentence was then partially accumulated on a sentence of 7 years imprisonment for the drug offence imposed against a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $550,000. Under the Criminal Code a marketable quantity of cocaine as an unlawfully imported border controlled drug is between 2 grams and 2 kilograms.

5The maximum penalty prescribed by s 302 of the Crimes Act for the false instrument offence is imprisonment for 10 years. However, since the offence was a Table 2 offence under the Criminal Procedure Act, the maximum penalty that could be imposed was 12 months imprisonment and/or a fine of 20 penalty units. His Honour imposed a fixed term of 12 months imprisonment and ordered that the sentence be served wholly concurrently with the sentence for the proceeds of crime offence. 

6Against a total sentence of 10 years imprisonment a single non-parole period of 6 years was imposed for the Commonwealth offences as provided for in s 19AB(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).

7The applicant relies upon five grounds of appeal:

1. The sentencing judge erred in sentencing on the basis of an incorrect maximum penalty (for the proceeds of crime offence).

2. The sentencing judge erred in sentencing the offender to a term of imprisonment of 1 year for the offence pursuant to s 302 of the Crimes Act.

3. The sentencing judge erred in the manner in which he dealt with the applicant's criminal record.

4. The individual sentences imposed were unduly harsh and severe.

5. The total accumulated sentence imposed was unduly harsh and severe. 

The evidence led on sentence

8A detailed statement of agreed facts was tendered on sentence upon which his Honour based his factual findings for sentencing purposes. 

9On 28 January 2010 an express mail package sent from Brazil arrived in Australia. The package was consigned to a Mrs Arimin of xx Boyle Street, Croydon Park. The package contained a thermos jug in which four packages of white powder were concealed which, upon later analysis, revealed a pure weight of 86.2 grams of cocaine. 

10On 3 February 2010 a light blue or champagne coloured car was seen parked on the western side of Boyle Street directly adjacent to a building site at number xx. A man of African appearance was in the driver's seat. 

11On 5 February 2010 an Australia Post courier attempted to deliver the package to the nominated address, however since the only premises at that address was a house under construction, and since the builders were unwilling to take receipt of the parcel, a collection slip was left in the mailbox advising that the package could be collected from Croydon Park Post Office. Later that day the vehicle was again parked directly adjacent to xx Boyle Street. Three men of African appearance were seen standing around the vehicle.

12Between 5 February and 9 February 2010 the package remained at the post office. On 9 February the package was seized from the post office by the Australian Federal Police pursuant to a search warrant. 

13Later that day a search warrant was executed at the applicant's residence. A light blue motor vehicle, the subject of a rental agreement, was also searched after which the applicant was arrested by police. A number of items were seized by police which were listed in the statement of facts, only some of which were ultimately relevant to the offences for which the applicant was convicted. Those items included:

(i) The Australia Post collection slip left at the premises at Boyle Street to which the drug package was consigned. 

(ii) A mobile telephone SIM card subscribed to an unknown person for a telephone number xxxxxxxx64 and connected on 3 February 2010. The contact number on the express mail package was xxxxxxx64, two digits short of the mobile telephone number when the international dialling code for Australia is applied. Analysis of the SIM card revealed that on 5 February 2010 (an hour after the attempted delivery of the package) a text message was received which read as follows: ""0297970207 Australia Post, Suburban Post Offices, Croydon Park, 166 Georges River Road, NSW 2133"".

(iii) A false driver's licence in the name of Simon Wells, date of birth 10 January 1974, which did not match any records held by the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority. (The applicant's possession of this document is the subject of the possess false instrument offence.) 

(iv) A post office box key bearing the handwritten number ""58"" which was connected with a post office box under the name of Simon Wells in Belfield.

14On the same day a search warrant was executed at a newsagency in Hurlstone Park, an agent of Western Union Financial Services, and a large number of documents relating to a total of $387,241 transferred overseas by the applicant in ninety separate transactions between June 2009 and February 2010 were seized. This constituted the offending the subject of the proceeds of crime offence. The applicant accepted by his plea of guilty that the money had been derived by him through his criminal activities. The countries the funds were sent to included Canada, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Spain and Nigeria. In each case the funds were transferred in a false name. 

The applicant's criminal records

15The applicant's criminal records in New South Wales from 2001 and in the United States of America between 1991 and 1999 were tendered. Multiple entries for the possession of false documents, including falsified foreign passports, and multiple entries for obtaining money by deception and other offences of dishonesty were recorded. He has served sentences of imprisonment in both jurisdictions. 

16In January 2003 the applicant was sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months for possession of a false instrument and concurrent terms of imprisonment for 3 years for eleven counts of obtaining money by deception (with additional offences on a Form 1). These offences were of relevance to the sentence proceedings, it being the applicant's evidence that the funds he telegraphically transferred were the proceeds of this offending and that upon his release from custody in 2004 he retrieved those monies from where they were hidden to repatriate in small amounts to his family. Although the Crown did not accept (and his Honour appeared to outright reject) that the money was repatriated for that purpose, the agreed facts recited the following: 
All of the money sent overseas by the offender through the 90 international fund transfers was the proceeds of crime. This money had been derived by the applicant through previous criminal activity by him, the possession and use of false instruments and obtaining money by deception.

17There was no evidence before the sentencing judge that the offending for which the applicant was sentenced in 2003 generated funds either in the amount telegraphically transferred or any nominated part of that sum. It was the Crown's submission that the offences for which the applicant was sentenced in 2003 were nonetheless ""intrinsically linked"" to the proceeds of crime offence on the basis that the funds generated from that offending comprised some part of the funds that were telegraphically transferred in 2009. In any event, by his plea of guilty the applicant accepted that the money transferred had been derived by him through his criminal activities. 

18The applicant gave evidence on sentence and tendered a number of letters from his wife. He also tendered a report dated 1 November 2011 from Sam Borenstein, a consultant clinical psychologist. The sentencing judge summarised Mr Borenstein's opinion in his sentencing remarks as follows: 
... the offender's criminal history is interpreted in the context of a complex chronic post-traumatic stress disorder which had its origins in his childhood. His father was a violent alcoholic who frequently beat his mother as well as the offender. He was physically and sexually abused at a young age. He was introduced to alcohol and drugs as a means of dealing with PTSD symptoms, and this allowed him to undertake work as a child prostitute in order to survive. He was taken in by an uncle when he was 15 years of age. He continued to abuse drugs and alcohol.

He has expressed optimism and resolves to ensure that he does not relapse. He has reflected on the last 20 years of his life as being a waste. He will require some intensive treatment over at least a two year period upon release from gaol to ensure he maintains focus on managing his core psychological disorder, namely complex and chronic post-traumatic stress disorder.

19The applicant gave evidence of his role in the drug offence. He claimed that he was asked by a friend, James Smith, a man he said he had met at a hotel nine months earlier, to pick up a package from the post office. He said he was offered $1000 and given the collection slip which was later found at his home to facilitate the collection. He said he did not know precisely what the package contained but believed it would contain an illegal substance. He said he was unable to pick up the package because he was known at the post office and the package was not in his name. He also admitted that he had lied to police when he said that he found the collection slip on the ground and that he was intending to hand it in to the post office. He also gave evidence that the driver's licence in the name of Simon Wells and the SIM card seized by police had been left in the blue car which was rented by the man who had asked him to collect the package. As noted above, he also claimed that the money he sent overseas was to his family. 

20His Honour did not regard the applicant as a credible witness. He described his version of events as ""bizarre"". He proceeded to sentence on the basis of the agreed facts unqualified by the applicant's evidence. His Honour was not, however, satisfied that the evidence supported the finding urged by the Crown that the money the subject of the proceeds of crime offence was being transferred for the purchase of drugs and, further, in assessing the criminality attaching to the drug offence, he did not appear to place any weight upon the applicant's possession of the SIM card as suggestive of any knowledge of the pending arrival of the package from overseas. 

21Although he said he would take into account the applicant's role for the purpose of sentence (presumably in committing the drug offence and the proceeds of crime offence), he did not, in his sentencing reasons, nominate or describe the applicant as having played any particular role in either offence, and did not appoint any level of objective criminality referable to what the applicant was proved to have done in committing those offences. He did, however, reject the applicant's evidence that he was collecting the package from the post office for his friend for which he was to be paid $1000, from which it is open to infer that for sentencing purposes the applicant was treated by his Honour as acting on his own behalf in attempting to obtain possession of the drugs, even if others might have been involved in some unspecified way. 

22In the result, in so far as is revealed by the reasons on sentence, the applicant was sentenced for attempting to obtain possession of the cocaine by his conduct in collecting the delivery note left in the mailbox (by necessary inference knowing it was there or expecting that it would be there), with the intention of securing access to the drugs inside the package and then, as his Honour found, for the drugs to be ""taken somewhere and used"". Although the applicant reported to Mr Borenstein that he had abused drugs and alcohol in the past, both as a young adolescent and after a number of past relationships failed, at the time of the offending he said that he was in a stable relationship which was current at the time of sentence which other evidence indicated commenced in 2002. On the basis of this evidence, and in circumstances where there was no evidence for a finding on the balance of probabilities that the applicant was a courier collecting the drugs for someone else (although he may have been), the only remaining inference is that the drugs would be sold by the applicant or otherwise supplied by him for reward. 

23In dealing with the proceeds of crime offence his Honour regarded the agreed facts as speaking for themselves. He made no finding of the level of objective criminality involved in transmitting the money but simply referred to the fact that the Crown had provided a number of cases, ""all different to some extent"", and ""having considered [those cases] and the other matters"", he determined that the appropriate head sentence is one of 5 years.

24His Honour also made no finding as to the criminality involved in the applicant's possession of the false licence, or the use to which the applicant intended to put it, save for the implicit rejection of the applicant's account that it was left in the car by the person ""James Smith"". 

25His Honour referred to the necessity to sentence for the Commonwealth offences in accordance with s 16A of the Crimes Act (Cth) and although he did not refer to each of the matters in s 16A(2) seriatum, he said he took into account what he described as the applicant's ""significant criminal record"" under s 16A(2)(m) and that the proceeds of crime offence involved a series of criminal acts under s 16A(2)(c).

The sentencing judge erred in sentencing on the basis of an incorrect maximum penalty for the proceeds of crime offence

26As noted above, the Crown conceded the error foundational to the first ground of appeal. The Crown also conceded in argument that the error was material in the sense that, as a matter of inference, it must have infected the sentencing judge's discretion when sentencing for the proceeds of crime offence and that, absent error, a lesser sentence may have been imposed. That concession does not entitle the applicant to have a lesser sentence substituted for the sentence imposed. It does however enliven the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (see EJDG v R [2012] NSWCCA 251 at [24]). The Crown submitted that on re-sentence, in light of the sentence of 5 years for what was submitted to be serious offending, the error in the misstatement of the maximum penalty, when assessed against the correct maximum penalty, would not attract the intervention of this Court (see Kirby J in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at [60], with whom Spigelman CJ agreed, Latham J publishing a separate judgment in substantial agreement with Kirby J). 

27The Crown also submitted that we would not be satisfied that the error had a material effect on the overall sentence as no lesser sentence than one of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years would be warranted in law. That submission assumes the applicant's challenge to the individual sentences (or any of them) as manifestly excessive fails (the fourth ground of appeal) and that the degree of accumulation between the drug offence and the proceeds of crime offence does not render the total effective sentence manifestly excessive (the fifth ground of appeal). Although it is not necessary for the applicant to establish that the sentence for the proceeds of crime offence was manifestly excessive, or even outside a notional range of sentences for offending of this kind to make good the first ground of appeal, in considering whether a lesser sentence should be substituted in accordance with s 6(3), the factors material to a consideration of the fourth and fifth grounds of appeal will also need to be considered. For my part, and for the reasons I will develop when considering those grounds of appeal, I am satisfied that neither the sentence for the drug offence nor the proceeds of crime offence is excessive and that the accumulation of two years has not been productive of an excessive total sentence. It is for that reason that despite the Crown's concession that the wrong statement of the maximum penalty was a material error making out the first ground of appeal, enlivening the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, I would not move to re-sentence the applicant on that ground.

28It remains necessary, however, to consider the other grounds of appeal to the extent that error of any other kind has impacted upon the sentences imposed.

The sentencing judge erred in sentencing the offender to a term of imprisonment of 1 year for the offence pursuant to s 302 of the Crimes Act 

29In the course of oral argument the Crown also conceded that although in his written submissions on sentence in the District Court the maximum penalty for the false instrument offence on the s 166 certificate was correctly nominated as 12 months and/or a fine of 20 penalty units (it being a Table 2 offence under the Criminal Procedure Act at the time the offence was committed), in the agreed statement of facts the maximum penalty was wrongly stated to be 2 years. I propose to reason on the assumption that his Honour sentenced the applicant referable to the statement of facts and imposed a 12 month sentence against the wrongly stated statutory maximum of 2 years which, in my view, is the overwhelming inference to be drawn from the fact that his Honour gave no reasons to justify the imposition of the maximum penalty. Although the Crown submitted that, in a practical sense, the error was not material since the sentence was ordered to be served wholly concurrently with the proceeds of crime offence (see Latham J at [84] in Baxter), it was ultimately conceded that despite the limited practical utility in re-sentencing the applicant, when any sentence we might impose would be ordered to be served wholly concurrently with the proceeds of crime offence and would by the date of re-sentence be fully served, it was appropriate that this Court should intervene and re-sentence since the imposition of the maximum available sentence for the false instrument offence could not be justified. 

30It was also submitted on behalf of the applicant that because the false instrument offence was before the sentencing judge under s 167(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act (that is, as a related offence on a s 166 certificate following the applicant's committal for sentence) his Honour should not have dealt with the offence by the imposition of a sentence at all (or, so far as I understood counsel's submission, the imposition of a fine) but that he should have availed himself of the alternate course offered under the section and refused to deal with the offence as being contrary to the interests of justice. No submissions were made to the sentencing judge as to any basis upon which that approach could properly be taken, and none offered by way of submissions before this Court in the event of re-sentence. In my view, although the false instrument offence was relatively minor in comparison with the other offences upon which the applicant was committed for sentence, there was nothing either in his personal circumstances or in the facts giving rise to his possession of the licence that would justify it being treated in the way suggested by counsel. 

31The applicant tendered a compendium of materials on re-sentence evidencing the sustained efforts on his part to prepare himself for his release. The materials included certificates of achievement and participation from a number of vocational and behavioural programs offered by Corrective Services and testimonials from the Chaplaincy Service at both Parklea and South Coast Correctional Centres. I propose by way of re-sentence a fixed term of 3 months imprisonment.

The sentencing judge erred in the manner in which he dealt with the applicant's criminal record 

32The sentencing judge referred to the applicant's criminal record in three different contexts in his reasons for sentence. On two occasions he described it as ""significant"", the first in the context of the applicant's subjective circumstances and then later when referring to matters to be considered under s16A of the Crimes Act (Cth). As to that his Honour said:
...I have to take into account his significant criminal record, and that his second offence consists of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts... 

33In the Crown's written submissions on sentence the applicant's criminal record was identified as one of the matters in s 16(2)(m) of the Crimes Act (Cth) which provides that, where relevant, a person's ""character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition"" are to be taken into account in the imposition of sentence. The Crown submitted that the applicant's record deprived him of the leniency that might be afforded a first time offender and that it justified greater emphasis being given to ""retribution and deterrence and the protection of society"". The applicant's counsel accepted that this was a correct statement of principle but submitted that because there was nothing in his Honour's sentencing remarks that indicated that the use of the applicant's record would be confined in that way, it should be inferred that his Honour impermissibly used it as an aggravating factor.

34The relevant principles as to the use a sentencing judge might make of an offender's criminal record have been recently restated by Hall J in Van Der Baan v R [2012] NSWCCA 5 (with whom Beazley JA and Harrison J agreed) at [30]: 
(1) The principle of proportionality as enunciated in Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 requires that a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime, having regard to the objective circumstances: Hoare v The Queen [1989] HCA 33; (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354; R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566; 163 A Crim R 381 at 572 per Spigelman CJ at [15].

(2) The proportionality principle applies so that a sentence should not be less than the objective gravity of the offence required: McNaughton (supra) per Spigelman CJ.

(3) The antecedent criminal history of any offender may not be used to increase the sentence beyond what is an appropriate sentence for the particular offence: Baumer v The Queen [1988] HCA 67; (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57.

(4) Accordingly, prior convictions do not themselves play a role in determining the gravity of the offence which, as the High Court confirmed in Hoare (supra), turns on the objective circumstances of the offence: McNaughton (supra) at [24]:
""... the principle of proportionality requires the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence to be set by the objective circumstances of the offence, which circumstances do not encompass prior convictions.""

(5) Prior convictions are pertinent in terms as to where, within the boundaries set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie: McNaughton (supra) per Spigelman CJ at [26] (Bell J (as her Honour then was) and Hislop J agreeing). This proposition may be seen to be reflected in references in Veen (No 2) (supra) to concepts such as an ""attitude of disobedience to the law"" and to the increased weight to be given to retribution, to ""deterrence"" (relevantly personal deterrence) and ""the protection of society"".

35His Honour's treatment of the applicant's criminal record was cursory, and his failure to make clear the precise manner in which it was to be taken into account, did nothing to enlighten the sentencing process (R v Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109). Having regard to the sentences imposed, I am not, however, persuaded that his Honour misused it in the way contended for by the applicant. 

36His Honour also referred to the fact that the applicant had convictions for fraud (and the fact that he engaged in sending money illegally obtained overseas - clearly a reference to the proceeds of crime offence) in rejecting the applicant's evidence as to the circumstances in which he committed the drug offence and the proceeds of crime offence. His Honour said:
His whole version is bizarre. I have difficulty in accepting anything this man told me as to what happened and why he committed the offences. He is not an acceptable witness. He has convictions for fraud and engaged in sending money illegally obtained overseas. He said that he was able to send the money overseas in false names by paying an employee at the newsagency each time he sent the money overseas. I do not accept his evidence. In sentencing him I rely on the facts as tendered and not his explanation.

37The fact that the applicant had convictions for offences of dishonesty was material to an assessment of his credibility and a matter his Honour was entitled to take into account when considering what weight he should give to the applicant's version as to how he became involved in the drug offence. On the other hand, there is some circularity of reasoning inherent in his Honour's rejection of the applicant's evidence that he was able to transfer funds overseas in a false name by paying an employee of the newsagency because he was engaged in that conduct. In the result, however, I do not see that anything turns on that fact since it was open to his Honour to reject the applicant's evidence on that issue by the adverse credit finding referable to the inherent improbability of his evidence generally. 

38Senior counsel for the applicant also submitted that in the passage extracted at [36] above his Honour treated the applicant's conduct in committing the proceeds of crime offence as somehow aggravating the drug offence. Were it susceptible to that construction, and I am satisfied it was not, it would have amounted to error.

39I would reject the third ground of appeal.

The individual sentences imposed were unduly harsh and severe

The total accumulated sentence imposed was unduly harsh and severe

40It is convenient to deal with these two grounds of appeal together. 

41In so far as the drug offence is concerned the applicant's counsel submitted that as a general proposition an attempt to possess a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug under s 307.6(1) of the Criminal Code usually attracts a lesser sentence than offences under s 307.1 of the Criminal Code which have as their fault element an intention to import a marketable quantity of the drug and, for that reason, sentences imposed upon importers, even couriers, were no guide to the sentence to be imposed in this case. That submission is not borne out by the sentences that have been the subject of review in this Court (as to which see the schedule of recent cases attached to this judgment which include those to which the sentencing judge was referred by the Crown). It is also contrary to what this Court has recently held to be the relevant principles that apply to sentencing for drug offences under the Criminal Code. 

42In R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R 106 at [72] Johnson J (with whom Macfarlan JA and RA Hulme J agreed) observed that the importation and possession offences under the Criminal Code provide for a structured sentencing regime by reference to the quantity of the border controlled drug, distinguishing between certain drugs in setting those quantities but otherwise making no distinction between them in terms of the maximum applicable penalties. Before considering the sentences under review in that case and setting out a number of general propositions emerging from the authorities applicable to sentencing for drug importation offences in [72](a)-(o), Johnson J said: 
...I include in this offences of attempting to possess a quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug contrary to s 307 Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). 

43In R v Karan [2013] NSWCCA 53, a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentences imposed for the offence of aid and abet an attempt to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine contrary to s 307.5, s 11.2 and s 11.1 of the Criminal Code, at [54] Adamson J (with whom Johnson and Harrison JJ agreed) referred to Nguyen; Pham and various of the general propositions Johnson J had set out in considerable detail in that case. Importantly, for the purposes of this appeal, both cases emphasise that for sentencing purposes there is no necessary distinction between the importation and possession of border controlled drugs and an attempt to possess such drugs.

44Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentence of 7 years imposed for the drug offence is excessive given what he submitted was the limited extent of the applicant's proven conduct in committing the offence and the relatively modest amount of cocaine involved. He also submitted that the applicant's proven conduct justified him being treated as no more than a bare courier of a quantity of drugs at the lower end of the marketable threshold. This, coupled with what was said to be a long history of drug use and dependency, was then said to position him within the third group of offenders identified by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 205 A Crim R 1 at [223] where a sentencing range of 3.75 years and 6 years as a head sentence was identified with a non-parole period between 2 years and 4.25 years. 

45Quite apart from there being no obvious analogy between what this applicant was proved to have done in his attempt to take possession of the cocaine and a courier of drugs in the sense customarily encountered in importation offences (and to which it would appear McClellan CJ at CL was referring when identifying offenders in the third group) and, as I have noted, no evidence suggesting the applicant's past history as a user of drugs and alcohol had any bearing on his current offending, this Court has observed, not infrequently, that there is limited utility in an applicant for leave to appeal attempting to position themselves within one or other of the categories of offender in De La Rosa. In R v Tran; R v Tran; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 136 I said:
[35] In a number of cases since De La Rosa was decided, this Court has held that limited assistance is to be gained by an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence endeavouring to position themselves in one or other of the categories of drug offender described by McClellan CJ at CL at respectively [207]-[215] in the case of commercial quantities of border controlled drugs and [216]-[223] for marketable quantities (see the cases referred to by Davies J in Thoung Nguyen v R [2012] 184 at [38]). What has been repeatedly emphasised in those cases is that the grouping of offenders into categories in De La Rosa by reference to common characteristics (so far as McClellan CJ at CL was able to identify them) was for general guidance and assistance to sentencing judges and not for use as a guideline judgment. 

[36] In R v Holland [2011] NSWCCA 65; 205 A Crim R 429 (a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence imposed for the importation of a commercial quantity of cocaine about which I will have something to say later in this judgment), McClellan CJ at CL at [3] said of his judgment in De la Rosa that it would be wrong to sentence an offender by attempting to discern the ""category"" into which they might fit and then imposing a sentence appropriate for an offence which happens to share the characteristics common to that category. In Holland Schmidt J at [52] (Buddin J agreeing) warned against a Crown appeal being mounted on the basis that the sentence under challenge fell outside the range applicable to offenders in one or other of the categories identified in De La Rosa. 

46Finally, the applicant's counsel placed reliance upon sentencing statistics which he submitted demonstrates that after applying the discount for the plea of guilty, a sentence of 7 years was at the top of the range of sentences for an attempt to possess a marketable quantity of a lawfully imported drug, with five of the twelve offenders in the sample receiving sentences of between 5 and 7 years (and three offenders, each of whom had criminal records, of 7 years). In my view, the statistics do nothing to advance the applicant's complaint that his sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. Quite apart from the qualification that attaches to the utility of relying upon sentencing statistics when challenging the adequacy or inadequacy of a sentence (see Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520; 204 A Crim R 434), where the sample of cases the subject of statistical analysis is small, as it was here, with only twelve cases prosecuted on indictment between 2008 and 2013, and where there was no information as to the weight of the drugs or the role played by an offender, no reliable conclusions can be drawn. 

47In my view, the summary of cases in the attached schedule, each of which has been the subject of appellate review, provides a more reliable source of information about a sentencing range relative to the applicant's offending. These cases, including cases decided in this Court in 2013, are also consistent with the analysis by Price J in R v SC [2008] NSWCCA 29. At [35], after reviewing the respondent's sentence for manifest inadequacy in circumstances where he attempted to possess 183 grams of cocaine and was sentenced to 3 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years from a ""starting point"" of 7 years (after allowing a 50 per cent discount), his Honour observed:
Statistics published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales were put before the Judge. They show that between January 2003 and March 2006 sixty one sentences were imposed for importing the trafficable quantity of cocaine [the equivalent to a marketable quantity under the Criminal Code]. The minimum head sentence was eighteen months and the maximum ten years. The minimum non-parole period or fixed term was twelve months and the maximum term seven years. All of the sentences in the published statistics were imposed after s 16G was repealed. Sixty four per cent of the sentences had a head sentence of between seven and nine years. A head sentence of ten years was imposed in only two per cent of cases. Eighty two per cent of the head sentences were, however, between six and nine years. These figures suggest that an appropriate range of sentences involving low level trafficable quantities of cocaine and heroin after the repeal of s 16G is a head sentence of between six and nine years imprisonment. (emphasis added)

48Accepting that the weight of the drug is just one of the factors to be considered in arriving at an appropriate sentence, the amount of pure cocaine in the applicant's case does position it at the lower end of the broad range of a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug under the Criminal Code. However, as borne out by the cases in the schedule, although the quantity of the drug is a recognised variable which affects the objective criminality of the offending, it does not translate into a particular sentence within the range. In my view, what remains significant in this case is that there is nothing in the facts led on sentence, or those which his Honour found for sentencing purposes, which allows for a finding that the applicant was attempting to possess the drug otherwise than for his own personal gain. In addition, and accepting that there was no basis for a finding that the applicant was involved in arranging for the drug to be imported, his conduct in both being at the address where the parcel was to be delivered both before and on the day delivery was attempted, and his efforts to obtain possession of the drugs by retaining the collection slip left by the postal officer at that address with the intention of collecting the drugs from the post office, reinforces that finding. 

49Having regard to the summary of cases in the schedule, including those the Crown relied upon on sentence, and the observations of Price J in R v SC, a discounted sentence of 7 years from a starting point of 8 years and 9 months, although at or towards the top of the range of sentences reflected in the schedule, does not appear to me to be excessive in the sense of it being ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"", there being little in the applicant's subjective case to displace the objective seriousness of the offending or to otherwise entitle him to any leniency.

50Despite his Honour's cursory analysis of the facts bearing on the commission of the proceeds of crime offence (see [23] of this judgment) and despite having undertaken no analysis at all of the objective seriousness of that offending, I am of the same opinion with respect to the sentence of 5 years imposed on the proceeds of crime offence despite it being imposed referable to a misstatement of the maximum penalty. Having regard to the objective circumstances relevant to that offending, and the applicant's subjective circumstances which were not compelling, a sentence of 5 years imprisonment was also, in my view, within an available range; it was not unreasonable or plainly unjust.

51From the detailed analysis of the authorities undertaken by Johnson J in R v Guo; R v Qian [2010] NSWCCA 170; 201 A Crim R 403 at [84]-[91] in each case where the importance of general deterrence is emphasised, the following factors relevant to an assessment of objective seriousness for breaches of Pt 10.2 of the Criminal Code (of which dealing in the proceeds of crime is one offence) seem to me to have an obvious application to the facts the sentencing judge found established in this case, even if he did not undertake any analysis of them for that purpose: 

(a) An appreciation of what the offender did, what acts he performed and over what period of time. 

(b) The amount of money involved in the commission of the offence - generally speaking a number of transactions involving smaller amounts of money will be more serious than a single transaction of a larger amount. 

(c) Whether the money belonged to the offender or to another person and what the offender knew of its provenance and the identity of the intended recipients.

(d) The degree of planning or deceit involved in the commission of the offence.

52In respect of each of these factors, the evidence supported a finding adverse to the offender in that he deliberately engaged in deceitful conduct by sending small amounts of money in a number of false names to a variety of destinations over an extended period of time, money which he conceded was the proceeds of criminal activity. The fact that the applicant knew that the money was from an illegal source is objectively more serious than where an offender is reckless as to that fact. In this case, while the sentencing judge made no finding that the money was to be transmitted for the purpose of furthering or facilitating the applicant's criminal activity in drugs (which would have aggravated the objective seriousness of his offending to a significant extent), he did not give the applicant the benefit of any positive finding that the money was to be sent solely, or even dominantly, to support his family in Africa. This was hardly surprising given the variety of destinations and named recipients in the records seized. In the result, there was simply no evidence that could be accepted as to why the money was being sent and the identity of any of the recipients.

53The applicant's counsel also advanced the submission that his Honour had inflated the offending constituted by the proceeds of crime offence by sentencing him twice for the offending which generated the funds which were telegraphically transferred. I am not persuaded that submission is borne out by the sentencing result and, as I have observed, and despite the paucity of the sentencing remarks, there is nothing from which an inference might be drawn that his Honour approached sentence in that way. 

54Finally, I can discern no error in the fact or degree of accumulation between the sentences imposed for the drug offence and the proceeds of crime offence or that the total sentence was plainly unreasonable or unjust. The offences involved legally, factually and temporally discrete criminal offending necessitating a significant degree of accumulation to properly reflect the total criminality comprehended by both offences.

55I propose the following orders.

1. Leave to appeal is granted.
2. The sentence imposed for the offence the subject of the s 166 certificate is quashed. In lieu thereof a fixed term of 3 months imprisonment is imposed to commence from 9 February 2010.
3. Otherwise dismiss the appeal against the sentences imposed in the District Court on 16 December 2011.

56RA HULME J: I agree with Fullerton J.


Schedule of cases

1.In Hay v R [2013] NSWCCA 22 the appellant pleaded not guilty to one count of importation and one count of possession of 250.7 grams of pure cocaine, contrary to s 307.2(1) and s 307.6(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). He had used his employment as a driver for a catering company that provided food to United Airlines to facilitate the collection of the imported drugs. He was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years for each offence, to be served wholly concurrently. 

2.In Kuti v R [2012] NSWCCA 43 the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of importation of 452.6 grams of heroin contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). He had consumed numerous packages containing the cocaine prior to boarding a flight from Nigeria to Sydney. He was 69 and had no criminal record. He was sentenced as a courier and was given a 25 per cent discount for his guilty plea. His sentence, confirmed on appeal, was 7 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. 

3.In Lindsay v R [2012] NSWCCA 124 the applicant pleaded guilty to the importation of 400 grams of cocaine, contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The cocaine was secreted on his body before he boarded a flight from Bangkok to Sydney. The sentencing judge found that he was more than a mere courier as he had arranged his own flights and accommodation and undertaken for the purpose of financial gain or to pay off a financial debt. He was 44 and had a lengthy criminal history. He was given a 25 per cent discount for his guilty plea. He was sentenced to 5 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. 

4.In Chong v R [2011] NSWCCA 182 the applicant pleaded guilty to the importation of 151.1 grams of cocaine, contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The cocaine was concealed in her underwear on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. She had a history of drug use and a criminal record in the United States. She was 25 and showed remorse and contrition. She was originally sentenced to 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years, however following a successful appeal she was re-sentenced to 5 years and 3 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months. 

5.In Brink v R [2010] NSWCCA 217 the applicant pleaded guilty to the importation of 210.5 grams of pure cocaine and 281.9 grams of heroin, contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The drugs were concealed within picture frames the applicant had placed inside his carry-on luggage on a flight from Johannesburg. The sentencing judge found that the drugs were imported for personal gain. His sentence, confirmed on appeal, was 8 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. 

6.In Okeke v R [2010] NSWCCA 266 the applicant pleaded guilty to five offences consisting of four counts of possession of a border controlled drug and one count of dealing with the proceeds of crime. Of the four drug offences, Counts 1 and 3 related to the possession of 80.4 grams and 371.9 grams of pure cocaine both contrary to s 307.6 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). On both counts he had attempted but did not succeed in collecting packages containing the cocaine sent from Brazil. He was assessed as being no more than a courier. He suffered post-traumatic stress disorder from an assault in 2004. A psychologist reported this gave him impaired judgment. On Count 1 he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 18 months and on Count 3 a term of imprisonment of 3 years. On appeal the total concurrent sentence imposed for the five offences was reduced, but the individual sentences for Counts 1 and 3 were increased to 2 years and 4 years and 6 months respectively. 

7.*In El-Ghourani v R [2009] NSWCCA 140; 195 A Crim R 208 the applicant pleaded guilty to attempting to possess 181.5 grams of heroin contrary to s 307.6 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The drugs were concealed within wooden frames that he arranged to be collected on his behalf. The sentencing judge assessed his role as more than a mere cog but was not satisfied he was the sole organiser. He had a prior criminal record, significant drug habit and a reluctance to admit to his involvement. It was difficult to determine his prospects of rehabilitation. He was given a 15 per cent discount for his guilty plea. His sentence, confirmed on appeal, was 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. 

8.In R v Mokoena [2009] QCA 36; 193 A Crim R 351 the applicant pleaded guilty to importing 113.5 grams of methylamphetamine, contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The sentencing judge assessed his role as that of a principal or importer. He was 29, had no prior convictions and gave very substantial assistance to authorities. His sentence, confirmed on appeal, was 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months. 

9.In Onuorah v R [2009] NSWCCA 238; 197 A Crim R 430 the applicant pleaded not guilty to attempting to possess 107.2 grams of cocaine, contrary to 307.6 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). He had leased a mail delivery box in Sydney which was the delivery address for a box from Venezuela containing the cocaine. He had made multiple efforts not to sign for the item. On appeal, a sentence of 7 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 10 months was confirmed. 

10.In R v TYN [2009] NSWCCA 146; 195 A Crim R 345 the applicant pleaded guilty to importing 242.3 grams of heroin, contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). She had agreed to act as a courier in order to repay a $20,000 drug debt. An early plea and valuable assistance to police that left her at some risk of retribution attracted a discount of 58 per cent. Her sentence, confirmed on appeal, was 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months.

11.In Mirza v R [2007] NSWCCA 257 the applicant pleaded guilty to importing 313.7 grams of heroin, contrary to s 233B(1)(a)(iii) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The sentencing judge did not positively characterise his role but found that he had left the country with an intention to import drugs on his return. He was to be rewarded $10,000 for the importation. He displayed shame and remorse for the offence. The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25 per cent for the guilty plea. His sentence, confirmed on appeal, was 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. 

12.In Viera v R [2006] NSWCCA 401 the applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to import 380.9 grams of cocaine contrary to s 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). His role was assessed to be a middleman. He assisted police in the prosecution of co-offender. He had a history of drug abuse but was found to have good prospects of rehabilitation and unlikely to re-offend. He was given a 20 per cent discount for his guilty plea. On appeal, a sentence of 10 years and 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months was confirmed. 

13.*In Okeke v R [2005] NSWCCA 444 the applicant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to possess 195.8 grams and 190.3 grams of cocaine, contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The applicant arranged for another person to collect two packages sent from Brazil. He had no prior criminal convictions but was found not to be of good character. Any discount for his plea of guilty was not specified but the plea was given after the trial was listed to commence. His sentence for each offence, confirmed on appeal, was 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, to be served concurrently. 

14.In R v Paliwala 2005] NSWCCA 221; 153 A Crim R 451 the applicant pleaded guilty to importing prohibited imports under s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) which he ingested in twenty-plus packages prior to embarking on a flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. His role was assessed to be that of a courier who stood to receive $20,000 for the importation. He was well educated but had suffered recent financial difficulties. On appeal, a sentence of 9 years imprisonment with a recognisance release order to be issued after he had served 5 years and 6 months was confirmed. 

15.*In Dang v R [2004] NSWCCA 265 the applicant pleaded guilty to attempting to possess 92 grams of heroin, contrary to s 233B(1)(c) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The drugs were concealed inside books and addressed to the applicant's premises. The sentencing judge assessed his role as at the middle level. He was 25 years old and came to Australia from Vietnam on a student visa. The sentencing judge found that his time in custody would be more difficult due to his limited English. He was given a 25 per cent discount for the guilty plea. His sentence, confirmed on appeal, was 7 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years.

2706295,R v Eckermann [2013] NSWCCA 188,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: I agree with Price J.

2PRICE J: The Director of Public Prosecutions (the Director) appeals pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed upon Anthony Eckermann, the respondent, in the District Court on 26 March 2013.

3The respondent pleaded guilty to the charge that on 23 June 2012 he did break and enter the dwelling house at x xxxxx xxx, and therein did assault Cassandra Haines occasioning actual bodily harm to her, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, he knew there were persons inside. This was a count of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Such an offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 5 years has been prescribed. 

4The respondent asked the judge to take into account on sentence an offence of assaulting Ms Haines contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act. Taking into account the matter on the Form 1, the respondent was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years. The judge directed that the sentence be suspended on the respondent entering into a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on the following conditions:

1. To be of good behaviour.

2. To appear before the court at any time if called upon to do so.

FACTS

7A statement of facts was tendered which the judge recounted in his remarks on sentence. The facts included the following: 
The offender and the complainant, Cassandra HAINES, had been in a domestic relationship for some 9 years, until 16 months ago when the pair separated due to domestic violence perpetrated by the offender. They have two children together. There was a domestic apprehended violence order in place from Queensland Police Force which named the offender as the defendant and the complainant as the protected person.
The complainant and her current partner Shannon ROBINSON had been in a domestic relationship for the last 8 months. At the time of the offence the complainant resided at a dwelling house situated at x xxxxx xxx, Muswellbrook with her three children; two of the offender. Mr. ROBINSON would stay over regularly.
Offence to be Taken into Acount (sic) - Common Assault DV (Haines) [Form 1 Offence]:
At about 10am on Friday, 22 June 2012, the offender attended the complainant's home to look after the children whilst she went to work. The complainant returned home at about 3:45pm. She and the offender sat out the front of the house and talked about their relationship whilst the children played in the front yard. The offender was getting upset and annoyed due to the discussion.
At about this time, Mr. Robinson arrived on scene and the offender muttered under his breath to one of the children, ""I'm gonna punch the shit out of that cunt"". The complainant heard this and remonstrated with the offender. The offender had his hands by his sides clenched in a fist, chewing his jaw. He questioned Mr. Robinson's need to be there, saying to the complainant, ""Why is he here? You're jeopardising my kid's safety. I'm going to smash him"". Mr. Robinson remained at the front of the property smoking a cigarette. The offender pushed past the complainant and approached Mr. Robinson. The complainant moved back in between the pair and as she did the offender swung a punch using his right fist at Mr. Robinson. It hit her on the left hand side of her face. She felt pain and walked away.
The offender and Mr. Robinson involved themselves in a verbal fracas. The children were in the front yard the whole time, yelling at the pair to stop fighting. The complainant took the children inside, the fracas stopped, and the offender left the area.
Count 2 - Aggravated Break and Enter and Commit Serious Indictable Offence (Assault occasioning Actual Bodily Harm) - Knowing Persons Inside:

Between the hours of midnight and 3:20am on Saturday, 23 June 2012, the complainant and Mr. Robinson were asleep in the bedroom of x xxxxx xxx, Muswellbrook with the complainant's three children asleep in the lounge area of the house. The offender made numerous phone calls to the complainant during this period, which she ignored.
At about 3:30am the complainant was woken by Mr. Robinson telling her that someone was tapping on the bedroom window. The complainant assumed it was the offender and went to the front door. She opened the front security door slightly and saw the offender standing right in front of the screen door. He said, ""Where is Shane, I'm going to kill that cunt. It's all your fault because you have let him back in your life and the kids"". The complainant immediately locked the screen door and said to the offender, ""the kids are having a sleep over. It's 4am in the morning. Shannon is asleep. Can you come back in the morning"". The offender became increasingly agitated and argumentative. The complainant shut the security door and locked it hoping the offender would leave. He did not and she could see him pacing back and forth on the veranda.
The complainant heard the front lounge room window move like someone was attempting to open it. She went over to the window and saw the offender standing at the window trying to pull it up. The complainant held down the window. Suddenly the complainant heard the glass smash above her head and she saw the foot of the offender come through the window further breaking the glass. The offender climbed through the window into the residence in one motion. The complainant saw blood all over the window sill and surrounding floor. The complainant stepped back from the window and told the kids to run down the hall away from the offender. The children were scared and yelling at the offender, ""Please stop. Leave us alone"".
Mr. Robinson observed the offender break the window and enter the house whilst Ms. Haines was telling him to get out and trying to prevent his entry. Mr. Robinsons, understanding the offender's ire would be directed at him, went into the laundry and closed the door over. He had called police on 000 and remained on the line at this time. From the laundry Mr. Robinson heard the offender searching the house yelling, ""Where the fuck is he?"" so he ran out the back door, jumped the back fence, and hid up the street.
The offender stood over the complainant and said, ""You're letting Shannon back into the house. Why can't I have a second chance? I'm going to kill Shannon! You have ruined my life and my family's life! You're a slut for being with Shannon."" He kept repeating, ""You wait till I find that cunt, I'm going to bury him alive"". The offender grabbed the complainant around the throat and face and squeezed. The complainant was fearful for her life. The offender pushed the complainant down the hallway into her bedroom by her face. The children were in this room crying under the blankets of the bed. Mr. Robinson was not in the room. The offender pushed the complainant onto the bed on her back, stood over her with both his fists clenched and raised, and yelled, ""Where is he? Where is he?"" The complainant sat up in the bed and the offender punched her with his left closed fist once to the right side of her face. The complainant felt pain immediately. She moved to beside the bed and huddled down with her three children. The offender asked one of his children for a cuddle, telling him that blood was nothing to be scared of. The child hugged his father. The complainant used this distraction to call Police. She left the line open but could not really talk to the operator. This call was recorded as recording 195074 and forms part of the Crown case on sentence.
Police arrived at the scene quickly and could hear yelling coming from within the dwelling house. Police knocked on the door and the offender opened the security door, leaving the screen door locked. Police attempted to talk to the offender but he would not let them inside the house, saying words to the effect of, ""Fuck off you dogs this has nothing to do with you"". Police noticed that both the offender hands were covered in blood. The complainant approached the door quietly and unlocked the screen door, before running back to her bedroom in fear of retribution. The police opened the screen door immediately but the offender shut the security door. The offender followed the complainant into her bedroom. He stood over [her] with clenched fists again, yelling, ""Where is Shannon? I'm going to kill that cunt! Why would you call Police? You're nothing but a dog. Why would you let him back in?""
Police heard screaming coming from within the house and fearing that a breach of peace was occurring, forced entry into the residence by kicking in the front security door. The offender, upon hearing police force entry, left the bedroom and entered the lounge room. As police entered the residence the offender rushed at them with clenched fists. He said to police, ""Don't fucking come in here you cunts"".
Police told the offender to get on the ground but he replied, ""Go and get fucked, come and have a go you fucking dogs"". After about five minutes of such discourse the offender became compliant and police handcuffed, cautioned, and arrested him.
Police located the complainant and her children crying under a blanket in the bedroom. Police observed a reddish mark to the left-hand cheek bone of the complainant. Police took photographs of the damage to the house; including the broken window, a broken mirror, a damaged door, and blood on the walls, the door, the floor and the bedding.""

The respondent's case 

8The respondent gave evidence during the proceedings on sentence. He was born on 27 October 1985 and was 26 years old at the time he committed the offences. During his evidence, the respondent said that he and Ms Haines had been in a domestic relationship for some 9 years, with the relationship ending in 2011. There were two children of the relationship, with the respondent also taking on a paternal role to a third child of Ms Haines. The respondent said that Ms Haines had asked him to move to Muswellbrook to help with the children which he did on 21 June 2012.

9The respondent acknowledged that he was subject to an apprehended violence order in Queensland that had been issued for Ms Haines' protection, but said that he had been told by a police sergeant that seeing Ms Haines would not be a breach of the order. He gave evidence that he intended to obtain permanent accommodation in Muswellbrook and to share custody of the children. He had not expected to see Shannon Robinson as Ms Haines had notified him that she had taken out an apprehended violence order (AVO) on Mr Robinson. When he ascertained that Mr Robinson was back in the house with the children, he was distressed and went to a hotel where he drank quite a lot and became heavily intoxicated. 

10The respondent said that on discovering he had missed telephone calls from his step-son and Ms Haines, he decided to go to Ms Haines' house to make sure his children were safe. He left the hotel at about 2am. He accepted that it was the wrong thing to do and was irresponsible. His purpose for going there was his concern for his children's well being. 

11The respondent gave evidence that he had seen a counsellor numerous times and had not consumed alcohol since the offence. He was currently employed as a permanent kitchen hand at the Muswellbrook Worker's Club. A letter from the Administration Manager of the club confirming the respondent's employment was tendered. 

12Peta McClintok, the respondent's girlfriend, gave evidence that she had known the respondent for about 6 ½ months and described him as being a gentleman. He was excellent with her three children and she had not seen him drinking alcohol.

13A three-page letter to the judge from Sarah Fyffe, Ms Haines' first cousin, was tendered. She stated that the respondent was an excellent, capable father to all three children. She detailed her discussions with Ms Haines about Mr Robinson which included Ms Haines telling her that she had another AVO in place against him. According to Ms Fyffe, Ms Haines told her that Mr Robinson had been repeatedly angry and violent towards her. 

14Other testimonials were placed before the judge which included a letter from Ms Haines' mother who stated that the respondent had lived with her whilst on bail and had obtained full time employment. Mrs Haines wrote (at AB 52):

""At the risk of my own daughter not wanting anything to do with me, I agreed to bail Anthony out at the time of the ""alleged"" offences, because I know Anthony. And I know how much he loves his children"".

15A report from a Drug and Alcohol Counsellor disclosed that the respondent had attended the Upper Hunter Drug and Alcohol Service for ongoing counselling and education on five occasions. The results of the assessment indicated ""a historic harmful pattern of heavy binge drinking"" (AB 47). The respondent last engaged in counselling on 7 November 2012 when he self-reported ""to have maintained abstinence from alcohol use since July 2012"" (AB 47).

16The respondent's prior criminal history includes offences of assault officer in execution of duty (2005), assault occasioning actual bodily harm (2005, 2006), and drive with high range PCA (2011).

Some findings by the judge 

17In his sentencing remarks, the judge said there was no doubt this was a most serious offence and no reasonable person would suggest otherwise. His Honour then said (at ROS 7):

""However, as bad as this was, in my assessment, in terms of [objective] gravity, this offence fell towards the lower end of the wide spectrum of offences covered by section 112(2)"".

18His Honour considered that the matter on the Form 1 was an attempt by the respondent to assault Mr Robinson and not Ms Haines. It was, ""a kind of transferred malice"" (ROS 10). 

19There was, his Honour said, a need for general deterrence particularly in a case like this involving domestic violence. His Honour took into account that the respondent had a prior record of violence. 

20His Honour observed that one of the striking features of this case ""is that whatever [the respondent's] deficiencies he was an extremely good father and a man who loved his children very much"" (ROS 9). As against the objective gravity of the offences, there were ""some strong subjective features"" (ROS 10). 

21In his Honour's assessment, the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. 

Ground 1: His Honour erred in his assessment of the objective gravity of the respondent's crime. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred in giving too much weight to the fact that the respondent was known to his victim in assessing the objective gravity of the crime. 

22It is convenient to deal with Grounds 1 and 2 together as they are in essence part of the same complaint. The Crown submitted that there were three features of the offence which, in the view of the judge, meant that the crime fell ""towards the lower end of the wide spectrum"" of offences captured by s 112(2) of the Crimes Act (ROS 7). The Crown contended that his Honour was in error in the way in which he viewed two of these three features, namely that the respondent was known to his victim and the respondent's motives were held to be a desire to protect his children, which led to an overall error in the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. 

23The Court's attention was drawn by the Crown to the following passage in the judge's remarks on sentence (ROS 7-8):

""The offender was not a stranger to [Ms] Haines, quite the reverse, of the children or even to Mr Robinson. The learned Crown Prosecutor, in her written submissions, withdrew an earlier concession that generically speaking the commission of this sort of offence by somebody who is known to the occupants is not necessarily less frightening than one committed by a stranger. All I will say about that is this, there are cases and cases. In my view, as bad as this was, this would have been less frightening than a home invasion by some stranger where the occupants, including Ms Haines, would have no idea initially why the stranger was there or what he or she was about.""

24The Crown submitted that these comments do not sit happily with the well documented vulnerability of women to violent attack by current or estranged partners. The Crown argued that in concluding that the offence was less serious than it otherwise would have been by virtue of the domestic relationship that existed between the respondent and Ms Haines, his Honour fell into error which was compounded by his assessment of the respondent's motive in entering Ms Haines' home. 

25It was the Crown's submission that the judge erred in concluding that the respondent committed the offence because of a concern for the safety of his children and that it was a feature which lessened the gravity of the offence. The Crown argued that the credible evidence established a very different and less commendable motive - a desire to inflict violence upon Mr Robinson.

26The respondent submitted that the judge did not make a specific error as contended by the Crown in Ground 1. The respondent pointed out that the judge found that ""this was a most serious offence"" and at no point did his Honour treat the case as otherwise than objectively serious (ROS 7). It was submitted that the judge's comments in the passage quoted at [23] above went to the issue of fear which was a relevant consideration. The respondent argued that ""[a] person with knowledge of the other will have some idea of the nature of the conflict and such knowledge may give rise to an expectation of a certain form of behaviour; whereas, the complete stranger, is an unknown quantity"" (RWS para 18). The respondent contended that it was an unwarranted leap based on a misinterpretation of his Honour's words that leads the Crown to infer that the judge was devaluing the violence because it was of a domestic kind. As to the Crown submission of error in the finding of the respondent's motive, the respondent submitted that his Honour's remarks were supported by the evidence. 

27A determination of where the subject offence lies on the scale of seriousness of an offence of its type is essentially one of fact and as such is reviewable in this Court only on the principles stated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40. As was said by Simpson J in R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 140 at [36]: 

""For the Crown to succeed on this aspect of the appeal, it is necessary that it establish that the finding, which is essentially one of fact, was not open to his Honour. The finding, being an evaluation, is akin to an exercise of discretion and may only be held to be wrong if it can be shown that some wrong principle was applied, or irrelevant consideration taken into account (or a relevant consideration overlooked) or that the finding itself simply was not open on the evidence: House v The King...""

28This Court has emphasised that where there is a challenge to a sentencing judge's characterisation of objective seriousness of an offence, the question is whether the particular characterisation which the sentencing judge gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to him: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 per Spigelman CJ at [37]. The approach in Mulato affirmed the importance of respecting the role of the sentencing judge, of paying due regard to his or her decision, and the need for caution before reaching a concluded view that the sentencing judge was in error: R v Fahda [2013] NSWCCA 86; R v KB; R v JL; R v RJB [2011] NSWCCA 190.

29Before assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, the judge recognised that an offence contrary to s 112(2) may be committed in a wide variety of different circumstances. His Honour said (at ROS 6):

""In terms of the objective gravity of this offence, the first thing I wish to note is this, that the range of conduct which will attract criminal liability under section 112(2) of the Crimes Act is very wide indeed.""

30The judge then referred to the circumstances of aggravation defined in s 105A which includes that the offender is: armed with an offensive weapon; in company of another person; uses corporal violence on any person; intentionally or recklessly inflicts actual bodily harm on any person; deprives any person of his or her liberty; and/or knows that there is a person, or there are persons, in the place where the offence is committed. His Honour noted that in the circumstances before him the infliction of actual bodily harm was in fact the serious indictable offence that had been committed and the circumstance of aggravation relied upon by the Crown was that there were persons in the place where the offence was committed. 

31In seeking to explain the wide embrace of offending contrary to s 112(2), the judge referred to such cases ranging from ""a group of strangers conducting what is sometimes and accurately known as a home invasion, with consequent terror of people within a dwelling, down to somebody who breaks into premises by opening a door and stealing some object inside..."" (ROS 7).

32His Honour then remarked that there was no doubt that this was a most serious offence, but assessed the offence ""towards the lower end of the wide spectrum of offences covered by s 112(2)"" (ROS 7). The three features identified by the judge ""amongst others"" for reaching that conclusion were (at ROS 7-8): 

(i) the respondent was not a stranger to Ms Haines. As bad as the offence was, it would have been less frightening than a home invasion by some stranger (see the passage quoted at [23] above);

(ii) there was a serious assault, but the actual bodily harm was very much to the lower range; and 

(iii) the primary motive for the respondent going to the home was because Mr Robinson presented some kind of physical danger to the children.

33During the proceedings on sentence on 22 March 2013, there had been some discussion between the judge and Ms Wilson, the Crown Prosecutor concerning the offence being one involving domestic violence. The judge in the course of the exchange with Ms Wilson said (at AB 77): 

""...But I can imagine some circumstances where it would be more terrifying if you didn't know, if the people in the house didn't know who the intruder was, because they would be less likely to know what the intruder was about.""

Ms Wilson responded (at AB 77):

""It would be, your Honour, I don't take issue with that. It would be more terrifying to have a stranger smash his way into your home. But he's not being sentenced for that...""

34The matter was adjourned for sentence on 26 March 2013. During the adjournment, Ms Wilson forwarded written submissions to the judge in which she withdrew the concession that a similar offence committed by a stranger would have been objectively more frightening and serious. Ms Wilson submitted that ""[t]here is no evidence as to how the occupiers would have felt about the comparable crime, and it is probably not useful to speculate on this point, or try to draw the comparison"" (Additional CPS p3).

35It appears that the judge did not accept the Crown Prosecutor's submission as he placed some importance on whether the offender was a stranger to Ms Haines or known to her as a factor in his characterisation of the offence. Home invasions by strangers are undoubtedly serious examples of an offence contrary to s 112(2), but so may be break and enters where an offender has previously been in a domestic relationship with the occupant of the house, particularly when there has been a history of domestic violence. In such cases, the victim's fearfulness should not be underestimated. An offence does not become less serious by virtue of a prior domestic relationship between an offender and the victim. The objective gravity of the crime is to be assessed on its facts. In Hussain v R; Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 184, Davies J observed at [80]:

""It was submitted on behalf of both Ali and Hussain that, all other things being equal, when an offender is a close relative of the victim that association in most cases and in the present case makes the act of criminality of a lesser nature. I do not agree with that submission. It overlooks the fact that a victim who is a relative, and particularly a wife, may be in a more, rather than a less, vulnerable position with regard to the wrongful acts of the offender. It contains the inference that it is less serious to commit a crime, whether a crime involving property or a crime of violence against a relative compared with a stranger.""

36On the facts of this case, I am unable to understand how the judge was able to find that the offence ""would have been less frightening than a home invasion by a stranger"". The respondent and Ms Haines had separated due to domestic violence perpetrated by him. Ms Haines had been struck on the face by the respondent on the previous afternoon. The respondent broke into the home at about 3:30am in a highly agitated state and grabbed Ms Haines around the throat and face. Ms Haines was fearful for her life. She was pushed down the hallway and onto her bed where the respondent punched her with his closed fist to the right side of the face. In my respectful opinion, the finding by the judge was not open on the evidence and his Honour erred in giving weight to the fact that the respondent was not a stranger to Ms Haines in characterising the objective seriousness of the offence. 

37The Crown does not complain about the judge's assessment of actual bodily harm. The facts reveal that Ms Haines had ""a reddish mark to the left-hand cheek bone"" and bruising was apparent when photographs were taken by the police (AB 34). The Crown does however contend that the judge was in error in concluding that the respondent's motivation in entering Ms Haines' home was a concern for the welfare of his children. 

38During his remarks on sentence, the judge found ""that in the offender's extremely drunken state his primary motive for going to this house in his clouded state of mind was because in his view Mr Robinson presented some kind of physical danger to his two children and also the son of [Ms] Haines, with whom the offender had became close"" (ROS 8).

39The judge referred to the AVO Ms Haines had obtained against Mr Robinson and found that ""[I]n the offender's mind... Mr Robinson presented some kind of physical danger to the children themselves, quite apart from Ms Haines"" (ROS 8). His Honour later said (at ROS 9): 

""Looked at in the cold light of day, that seems a very odd thing to do at about 3 o'clock in the morning but I can accept that in the offender's drink addled mind, at that hour of the morning, it may have seemed a logical thing to do. 

The point is this, in my view, that there was at least a significant component in the offender's mind at that time of his concern for the welfare of his children. Whether or not there was also a significant component of jealousy against Mr Robinson for his relationship with Ms Haines, it is very difficult to say. There is no question that at least by the time the offender got to these premises that he was bent on physical violence directed towards Mr Robinson, no doubt because he believed that Mr Robinson was a threat to his children, which I am satisfied beyond any doubt on the evidence he loved very dearly indeed."" 

40There was evidence before the judge that the respondent loved his children and that he was intoxicated at the time of the offending. There was also evidence that the respondent had been told by Ms Haines that she had taken out an AVO against Mr Robinson. The respondent had given evidence as to his reasons for going to the home and it was open to his Honour to make these findings as to motive. 

41Although upon the judge's findings the respondent's primary motive in going to the home was his concern for the children, it is plainly evident that his actions of violence towards their mother terrified the children who were 6, 7 and 11 years old. 

42An aggravating factor to be taken into account was that ""the offence was committed in the presence of a child under 18 years of age"": s 21A(2)(ea) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In Gore v R; Hunter v R (2010) 208 A Crim R 353; [2010] NSWCCA 330, Howie J observed at [104]: 

""...it is not difficult to appreciate that the provision in s 21A(2)(ea) is principally aimed at the deleterious effect that the commission of a crime, particularly one of violence, might have on the emotional wellbeing of a child. The commission of the offence may also be deleterious to the child's moral values. It does not matter whether the offender is a parent of the child or not, although if it is a parent this will be particularly aggravating.""

43The judge said that he had taken ""into account that the children were present during this episode and that it was a very unseemly and upsetting incident"" (ROS 10). However, his Honour did not make any reference to the commission of the offence in the presence of the children as being a factor of aggravation. This was an important consideration which his Honour overlooked. 

44I am mindful that questions of weight are matters for the discretion of the sentencing judge and will not unusually justify intervention upon appeal: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85. In the present case, however, the weight that his Honour gave to the applicant's primary motive for going to the home was one of the matters that led to error. 

45In my respectful opinion, very little weight could be given by the judge to the respondent's primary motive for going to home as a factor that reduced the objective seriousness of the offence. The gravamen of the respondent's offending is what he did after he arrived at the home. 

46I conclude that it was not open to the judge to characterise the offence as being ""towards the lower end of the wide spectrum of offences covered by section 112(2)"" (ROS 7). The evidence compels a finding of objective seriousness towards the middle of the range for such an offence. 

47I would uphold Grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal. 

Ground 4: His Honour erred in his approach to the suspension of the sentence. 

48It is appropriate to deal with Grounds 3 and 4 out of chronological order. 

49The Crown's assertion of error focuses upon the remarks on sentence when the judge was dealing with the question of whether to suspend the respondent's sentence. His Honour said (at ROS 12):

""Section 5 of the Sentencing Act says that a court is not to impose a sentence of imprisonment in effect unless there is no other suitable penalty available. In my view, that principle applies also to a sentence of fulltime imprisonment. The question, in my view, in this case is, as bad as this was, looking at all the circumstances, should Mr Eckermann receive a fulltime custodial sentence. My instinctive synthesis indicates that the answer to that question is ""No"". 

50The Crown accepted that the judge correctly dealt with the preliminary issue under s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act of whether no penalty other than imprisonment was appropriate, but submitted that his Honour thereafter erred. The Crown contended that in stating ""that principle applies also to a sentence of fulltime imprisonment"" his Honour wrongly applied the terminology in s 5(1) to the question of whether a full-time sentence should be imposed (ROS 12). The Crown pointed out that his Honour was required at that stage to nominate the term of the sentence without having regard to how the sentence should be served, and only then determining whether an alternative to full-time imprisonment should be imposed. The Crown also referred to his Honour's reference to ""instinctive synthesis"" as further highlighting error as such an approach was said by the Crown to be entirely contrary to what is required by a sentencing court in imposing a suspended sentence. The Crown argued that this was a fundamental error of approach that led to the imposition of a manifestly inadequate sentence. 

51The approach that a court is required to undertake when sentencing an offender to a suspended term of imprisonment was explained by Howie J in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [22] - [30]. The preliminary question to be asked and answered is whether there are any alternatives to the imposition of a term of imprisonment. Having determined that there is no other penalty appropriate other than a sentence of imprisonment, the court is next to determine what the term of that sentence should be. Once the term of the sentence has been determined, the court is then to consider whether any alternative to full-time imprisonment is available in respect of that term and whether any available alternative should be utilised. 

52Although his Honour asked the question whether the sentence should be suspended before announcing the term of imprisonment, I am not persuaded that he overlooked the necessity of first determining the length of the sentence. A sentencing judge is not required to expressly state that these two steps have been taken before the sentence is suspended: Zamagias at [30]. To my mind, the Crown's complaint amounts to no more than a matter of form, rather than substance. I would reject Ground 4 of the appeal. 

Ground 3: In all the circumstances the sentence is manifestly inadequate. 

53The Crown's complaint of manifest inadequacy centred upon the suspension of the sentence and not on its length. It was the Crown's submission that, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence and the particular need for general and personal deterrence, a full-time custodial sentence was required. The respondent submitted that, in the whole of the circumstances, the imposition of a custodial sentence and then its suspension was appropriate. 

54Notwithstanding the respondent's subjective circumstances that include love for his children, his employment and good prospects of rehabilitation, I am of the opinion that a suspended sentence was manifestly inadequate. This was a serious offence of violence by the respondent. When women (and men) enter into a new domestic relationship, they are entitled to do so without the threat of violence from a former partner. This is particularly so when there are children of the prior relationship as acts of violence towards a parent particularly when committed in the childrens' presence have the potential to impact severely upon their well-being and future development. 

55This Court has emphasised the seriousness with which violent attacks in domestic settings must be treated: Hiron v R [2007] NSWCCA 336. Specific and general deterrence, denunciation of the offending conduct and the protection of the community are important factors in sentencing a domestic violence offender: R v Dunn (2004) 144 A Crim R 180; [2004] NSWCCA 41; R v Edigarov (2001) 125 A Crim R 551; [2001] NSWCCA 436; R v Hamid (2006) 164 A Crim R 179; [2006] NSWCCA 302. In my view, the respondent's subjective circumstances could not justify the suspension of the sentence. A full-time sentence of imprisonment was called for. 

56The question remains as to whether the Court should intervene and re-sentence the respondent. There is a residual discretion to decline to interfere even though the sentence is manifestly inadequate. 

57In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462, the majority (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) observed at [1] that the primary purpose of Crown appeals was to ""lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons."" Their Honours at [36] described the primary purpose of laying down principles as a ""limiting purpose"" and said:

""...It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion."" 

58Their Honours observed at [43] that other circumstances may combine to produce injustice if a Crown Appeal is allowed. Their Honour's said at [43]: 

""...They include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the respondent's release on parole or unconditionally, and the effect of the re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation. They are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. The guidance afforded to sentencing judges by allowing the appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual.""

59At the hearing of the appeal, no material was provided by the respondent as to his present circumstances. The Court's knowledge of the respondent is restricted to the material before the judge when he was sentenced in March and his entry into the s 12 bond on the day of sentence. There is no evidence as to any progress that he might recently have made towards rehabilitation. It is surprising that an up to date report from the Probation and Parole Service was not tendered. The hearing of the appeal and its determination has not been unduly delayed. I do not consider that by allowing the appeal, the guidance to sentencing judges comes at too high a cost in terms of ""justice to the individual"". 

60For the purposes of re-sentencing, the objective and subjective considerations to be taken into account are clear from what I have written to this point. Taking into account the offence on the Form 1, I would allow the appeal and re-sentence the respondent to a term of imprisonment for 2 years. I would find special circumstances being the respondent's need for rehabilitation, particularly in relation to his long-standing abuse of alcohol and fix a non-parole period of 14 months. The respondent spent three days in custody following his arrest before bail was granted and he has been the subject of the suspended sentence since 26 March 2013. Accordingly, the sentence is to commence on 23 March 2013. 

Orders:

61Accordingly, the orders I propose are as follows:

1. Appeal allowed.

2. Sentence imposed by Hosking SC ADCJ on 26 March 2013 
quashed. 

3. In lieu thereof sentence the respondent to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 months commencing on 23 March 2013 and expiring on 22 May 2014 and a balance of term of 10 months expiring on 22 March 2015.

4. Direct that the respondent be released on parole on 22 May 2014.

5. The conditions of the respondent's parole are to include the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service with particular emphasis on alcohol rehabilitation. 

62RA HULME J: I agree with Price J.

2706316,R v Ahola (No 8) [2013] NSWSC 1128,"Judgment

1On 29 April 2013, Jouni Risto Ahola (to whom I shall usually refer in these remarks as ""the offender"") was arraigned before a jury panel and me. The single count contained in the indictment alleged that, on 18 October 2011, he murdered Sandra Margaret Thomson (to whom I shall usually refer in these remarks as ""the deceased""). The offender pleaded not guilty, a jury was empanelled, and the trial proceeded until 30 May 2013. On that day, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder. On 2 August 2013 evidence was taken and submissions received in the proceedings on sentence. As a result of those events, the offender comes before the court for sentence today.

Fact-finding on sentence

2A number of facts were not the subject of dispute between the parties at trial. They include matters of background relating to the life of the deceased. Similarly, on sentence, there was no dispute by the Crown with regard to matters of background with regard to the offender.

3With regard to matters that have been the subject of dispute, before I could take a matter into account in aggravation against the offender, I would need to be satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt. In order to take a matter into account in mitigation in favour of the offender, I would need to be satisfied of it on the balance of probabilities. It may be, of course, that I am unable, on the evidence, to make a firm finding about some matters: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; (1999) 199 CLR 270.

4It is my role to make findings of fact consistent with the elements of the offence of which the jury found the offender guilty. It is not my role to try to determine the facts that I consider that the jury must or may have accepted: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; 90 A Crim R 587.

Aspects of the offence

5On 18 October 2011, the deceased was living in a rented flat in the coastal village of Malua Bay, several kilometres south of Batemans Bay on the south coast of New South Wales. Staying with her in those premises was the offender. 

6The circumstances that had led them to be in that flat together were as follows. The deceased had grown up on the south coast of New South Wales, but had lived for many years in Queensland. There she had married and raised a family. A decade or so before the day in question she had separated from her husband. Unfortunately, in middle age the deceased had developed a serious drinking problem. It substantially affected her health and her relationships. As a result of that problem, she gradually became estranged from her siblings and her children. For a while in the middle of 2011 she lived with her brother and his family on the Central Coast of New South Wales. Eventually it was decided that it would be better for all concerned if she were to live on her own. The deceased wished to return to the area in which she had grown up, and obtained a lease over the premises at Malua Bay in July 2011.

7Whilst she was living with her brother, she had met the offender one rainy evening in a hotel at Gosford. They quickly formed a romantic relationship, even though the offender lived in Tarcutta, on the edge of the Snowy Mountains region. They stayed in close contact by phone calls and text messages.

8The offender had visited the deceased at her flat in Malua Bay for a separate stay some weeks before. That visit had gone well. Indeed, by 18 October the couple had announced to some friends and family members that they were to be married, and arrangements had been made for the wedding to occur later in the year.

9Despite everything appearing rosy on the surface, things were not as positive as they seemed. The offender shared the deceased's commitment to alcohol, and, in short, they were both heavy and problematic drinkers. Neither was working at the time, and they were short of money. Life together in Malua Bay was circumscribed, not least by the fact that they did not have access to a car.

10More ominously, even on the version of events that the offender later gave to the police, he and the deceased were bickering about trivial things. A tradesman who attended the flat the day before gave evidence in the trial that, during the hour he was there, the two of them were arguing more or less continually.

11Returning to 18 October 2011, the offender completed some gardening chores throughout the day. In the afternoon, he and the deceased walked to the small local shopping centre of Malua Bay, arriving there at about 3pm. There they purchased some foodstuffs, some tobacco, and a bottle of rum. The CCTV of that visit suggests that they were happy to be in each other's company, and that nothing was amiss.

12By early evening, the bottle of rum had been consumed. The offender returned alone on foot to the shops, and purchased a large cask of wine. He was seen by neighbours making his way back to the flat through the streets of Malua Bay shortly before 9pm. During that journey he spoke by telephone to a female friend and asked her to be a bridesmaid at the wedding. Again, that conversation suggests that nothing was wrong.

13By 9:13pm the offender was back at the flat. At that time he rang the switchboard of the Queensland Police. He was seeking a Detective Ron Wanklin, who was a police officer with whom the deceased had had some dealings in the past. The call was recorded, and the deceased can be heard in the background. Careful listening to the recording demonstrates that she was not in physical or emotional distress, and that she and the offender were on affectionate terms.

14It is not clear to me why the call to Queensland Police was made. The position of the offender at trial was that he called because he had seen some persons who it was felt might have wished to do the deceased harm, as a result of ill feeling arising from events in Queensland. In light of the fact that that assertion of the offender was part of the general attempt on his part to deflect implication in the murder away from himself, I do not accept it. But the fact remains that something must have happened that prompted the phone call to Queensland. Whether that precipitating event has anything to do with the tragedy that occurred very shortly afterwards is impossible to determine.

15Soon after that phone call was completed, the offender and the deceased were in the small kitchen of the flat. The deceased was most probably in the process of cooking dinner. It was then that the offender struck the deceased a number of very forceful blows to the head. In all likelihood the first blow was from behind. From a very early stage, and perhaps at the time of the very first blow, the offender used a wooden baton that the deceased kept in the flat for her own protection. At some stage, the deceased sought to escape from the kitchen into the front yard via the glass sliding door, but she was unable to do so. No neighbours heard what was happening, because Malua Bay is sparsely populated in the holiday off-season.

16The motive for this vicious assault is not clear. I mean no disrespect to the deceased when I say that I infer that she could on occasion be a difficult woman, and especially when she had been drinking. In seeking to work out what happened, it is worth noting that the offender had not shown himself to be a violent man in the past, a topic to which I shall return.

17It may be that an argument about a trivial matter escalated; perhaps the subject matter was as banal as the meal that was about to be served. It may be that the deceased made some sort of disparaging remark about the offender. Perhaps she called into question the wedding, thereby enraging him. Of course, if it was the deceased who said or did something that led to the infliction of murderous violence upon her, it goes without saying that her actions did not provide the slightest justification for it.

18At the time of the attack in the kitchen, I am prepared to accept that the offender had lost self-control to a substantial degree. But there was a pause, as the blood pattern demonstrates to my satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt. For a period that cannot be precisely quantified but that was certainly not momentary, the deceased was stationary near the stove, and blood from her wounds dripped onto the kitchen floor and formed a substantial pool. Satellite spatters demonstrate that blood was falling into blood. I am satisfied to the criminal standard that the attack had abated at that stage. Furthermore, it is very hard to imagine that the deceased, having been struck a number of times, badly injured, and bleeding, was stationary and standing or leaning over the sink. After consideration, I am satisfied that she was lying with her head on the floor in or very near the pool of blood. At that stage, the offender had regained his composure, at least to a sufficient degree to stop attacking the deceased.

19Later, the deceased moved or was moved from the kitchen to the bathroom. It is not clear whether that was of her own motion, or whether the offender moved her there, perhaps in an effort to clean her wounds. Whichever it was, shortly after arriving at the bathroom the deceased tried to stop the offender from entering the bathroom by forcibly shutting the door against him. She failed; he entered; and, armed with the baton, he beat her to death in that location.

20The photos of the blood patterns in that small room speak eloquently of the violence inflicted upon the person of the deceased. It is noteworthy that the blood spatter extends to the ceiling of the bathroom. It is also indicative of the ferocity of the attack that there were later found to be defensive bruises to a forearm of the deceased. Even more telling is the fact that the deceased was found on post-mortem to have 19 separate injuries, almost all of them to the head, and they included a fractured skull. Considering the severity of the assault upon the deceased more generally, it is enough to say that the blows were of sufficient force for the wooden baton to have broken in two. 

21The deceased ended up lying face down on the bathroom tiles. At a late stage of the attack, a very powerful blow was inflicted to the back of her head, resulting in a significant blood pattern at a low point on the bathroom wall. 

22I accept that the offender lost self-control to a degree and was, at the time of the attack in both rooms, in something of a frenzy. However, as I have indicated, the offence was not one explosion of violence that quickly subsided. There was a not insubstantial pause before the offender recommenced the attack. It is true that there was some loss of self-control on the part of the offender. However, the number of injuries; the infliction of violence in two separate locations, punctuated by a pause; the use of a weapon; the defensive injuries; and finally the location of the vast majority of blows, namely to the head and neck of the deceased, establish in combination beyond reasonable doubt an intention to kill. Counsel for the offender has not sought to argue otherwise. 

23At the end of the attack, the offender recovered his composure. He realised that he had inflicted very serious injuries on the deceased, and that she was either dead or in grave danger of dying. I accept on the balance of probabilities that he rolled the deceased over and, using his first aid training, performed CPR upon her in a futile effort to save her life. And I regret to say that, shortly thereafter, the offender callously smoked a cigarette over the deceased and permitted ash to fall on to her body as he pondered what to do.

24Thereafter, the offender retreated to the backyard with the cask of wine and a packet of cigarettes. It took quite some time for him to phone 000. I accept that that delay is partly accounted for by the shock of the offender at the terrible consequences of what he had done. But the delay is also accounted for by the offender carefully considering what he could do or say in order to avoid punishment for his actions.

25Eventually, he rang the police and they attended at the scene. Although somewhat drunk, he gave them a version of events that was a considered mixture of truth and lies. He did the same when he was formally interviewed very early next morning at Batemans Bay Police Station. Regrettably, he did the same in the witness box before the jury and me.

26In particular, the offender told the police that he rang the Queensland Police because, after he had returned from the trip to the shops in the evening, he had found his fiancée brutally murdered by an unknown assailant. That was undoubtedly a lie: when he told it, the offender was not to know that the telephone call had been recorded, and that the recording would subsequently prove that at the time the call was made the deceased was alive and well. 

27The offender was arrested on 19 October 2011, and he has been held in custody ever since.

Objective seriousness of the offence

28The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life without parole, and, in the circumstances of this case, a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 20 years. I regard each of those matters as important guideposts in my approach to sentencing. It has not been submitted by the Crown Prosecutor that this is a matter that calls for the imposition of the maximum penalty. 

29All murders are profoundly serious, involving as they do the criminal taking of the life of a fellow human being in the worst circumstances known to law. But it is possible, even accepting that characterisation of all murders, to construct a general range of seriousness of the offence. For example, a murder committed with an intention to kill may very often be more serious than a murder committed with only an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. A murder committed by a cold-blooded contract killer for money may very often be more serious than a murder committed spontaneously and without premeditation.

30If this murder had been premeditated, the offender would have committed the offence in such a way that he could cover his tracks far more effectively than he did. I am satisfied that the murder was unplanned and spontaneous, and that it was the product of a highly emotional state on the part of the offender.

31On the other hand, there was an intention to kill. As I have discussed, there was also a period when the violence stopped and the offender composed himself, only to recommence the attack in a different location. A weapon was used with great force. The final ordeal of the deceased was extended, merciless and excruciating. Ultimately, she was left to die on the bathroom tiles.

32In all of the circumstances, this murder cannot be characterised as anything other than very grave.

Aspects of the offender

33As I have indicated, these sentencing proceedings arise after a trial. Neither the offender nor his counsel has said anything since the verdict of the jury was delivered to indicate that the offender takes responsibility for the death of the deceased in the slightest. Whilst the offender is not, of course, to be punished for pleading not guilty and the maintenance of his position, there can be no reflection in the sentence of any utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system. Nor can the sentence reflect remorse on the part of the offender, or even an acceptance of responsibility.

34The offender was affected to some degree by alcohol when he murdered the deceased. Indeed, I consider that he was affected to some degree by alcohol for much of the time he was at Malua Bay. I shall return to the subject of the relationship of the offender with alcohol, but it is enough to say at this stage that the offender was a very experienced drinker who certainly was not unusually or unexpectedly intoxicated on the evening in question.

35On the other hand, I consider that his intoxication at the time played some role in the commission of the offence, because the well-known disinhibiting effects of alcohol made him more liable to lose control. It is not the case that the offender well knew from past events that intoxication would lead him to become violent. I have reminded myself of the decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal to the effect that drunkenness can ""cut both ways"" with regard to offences in general, and offences of violence in particular. In the circumstances of this case, I have reduced the sentence to a small degree to reflect the fact that the offender was not completely sober at the time he lost self-control and inflicted a violent death upon the deceased.

36The offender was born in August 1961, and was accordingly aged 50 years on 18 October 2011, and is now aged 52. He is of Finnish background. An only child, he arrived in this country with his parents at the age of 9 years. After a short period in a migrant hostel, the family moved to the Snowy Mountains area, and the offender has lived there throughout his adult life. There is nothing to suggest that he suffered the deprived or unsatisfactory background of so many offenders who come before the criminal courts, but I am prepared to infer that his upbringing was not one of privilege or indulgence.

37The offender left school at the age of fifteen. Since that time he has worked as a carpenter. Although he was not working at the time of the offence, the evidence suggests that that was because he was between jobs. I accept that he has been a diligent, skilled and steady worker throughout his adult life.

38Many years ago the offender was married, and he has three adult daughters from that union. The written evidence on sentence speaks highly of him as a son and a father. There is also evidence from family members and friends that the offender is not a violent or even an angry man, whether drunk or sober. Many persons have expressed their inability to understand the actions of the offender that evening. They assert that this murder was an out of character aberration in the life of the offender.

39On the other hand, when the offender was in the witness box and in the early stages of cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, he almost immediately came across as an angry, even aggressive, person. That was at a time when the offender must have known that it was essential that he impress the jury as being mild-mannered. I record that the trial transcript goes no way to reflecting the atmosphere in court at that stage.

40At first I thought that that passage of the evidence provided a more accurate picture of the personality of the offender, a decidedly adverse picture. But, on reflection, I accept the submission of his counsel that the demeanour of the offender on that occasion was the result of the enormous stress he was under, along with the inevitable restrictions arising from his conditions of custody. In short, I am prepared to accept the evidence that the offender has not in the past been a person prone to violence.

41The criminal record of the offender is lengthy, but it is not of the greatest seriousness. It is noteworthy that it began when the offender was aged 22 years, when he was convicted of drink driving. Shortly after that he was convicted of a crime of violence, namely assaulting a female, although it was disposed of in the Local Court by a small fine and a short bond. I infer from those facts that it was a less serious matter. Since then, his criminal record suggests that he has on occasions been nothing more than a nuisance. For example, his convictions include offences founded on kicking over a garbage bin, throwing an object at a ferry, and failing to leave licensed premises.

42On the other hand, firearms offences committed in 2006 and dealt with in the District Court at Parramatta have a more serious flavour. So does the fact that, having been gaoled for a short period in 2010 for repeated driving offences and released to parole, the offender committed the offence of murder only months after his conditional liberty expired.

43Speaking more generally about the criminal record of the offender, his counsel did not seek to dissuade me from my original impression that all of those convictions could well be related to alcohol.

44On that topic, whether the offender cares to accept it or not, he certainly has an issue with alcohol. He has been convicted of driving whilst under the influence many, many times. Indeed, he was seen some months ago by Dr Nielssen. Although that eminent forensic psychiatrist found no sign of mental illness or intellectual disability, he diagnosed the offender as suffering from an alcohol abuse disorder. Alcohol has brought the offender before the courts repeatedly over the years; it led him to be living in Malua Bay with another person with the same issue; and it has played a role in him being found guilty of murder.

45It is true that the evidence is that the offender, like many people, merely gets a little loud when drunk, but does not otherwise misbehave. But it is also true that the evidence to that effect is from the licensee of the Batlow Hotel, where the offender was a regular drinker, and it refers to occasions upon which the licensee has refused to serve the offender more alcohol. Other references refer to the applicant as ""a bit of a scoundrel"", ""foolish"", and ""no saint"", and I consider that alcohol has exacerbated those character traits over the years.

46For many years into the future, the offender will not be in a position to drink alcohol. In light of everything that has happened, I consider that the offender should, whilst in custody, seek to address the underlying emotional issues that have led to his relationship with alcohol and that have, at least indirectly, led to him being in the dock today.

47As for his prospects of rehabilitation, it seems that the offender will be able to serve his sentence quietly and constructively. I expect that he will be a worker during the years ahead, and that he will maintain a good relationship with his mother and stepfather and daughters, all of whom are supportive of him. When he becomes eligible for release, he will have been free of alcohol for a very long time. By then he will not be a young man, and that will perhaps play a role in making it less likely that he will lose control and inflict violence upon another person again. As I have said, he has certainly not demonstrated in the past an entrenched tendency to be violent. In all the circumstances, I possess a guarded optimism about the rehabilitation of the offender.

Comparable cases

48The Crown Prosecutor provided me with statistics to do with sentences for murder generally, a table of cases from the Public Defenders of sentences at first instance and on appeal for killings in a domestic setting, and a number of judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal with regard to appeals against sentence in the same general circumstances. I do not regard it as necessary to embark upon a detailed analysis of all of that material, though I have found it very helpful and taken it into account. 

49Of course, each case turns upon its own facts. Here, as I have indicated, the offence featured an intention to kill; there is no remorse or utilitarian discount; a weapon was used over an extended period; and the offence is subject to a standard non-parole period of 20 years. That is in contrast to many of the sentencing decisions to which I was referred. 

Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999

50I will not mechanistically work my way through the statute or the aggravating and mitigating features in this case. I trust that my discussion of the objective and subjective aspects of the matter will appropriately reflect those features I have found to exist in this case. I have referred myself to the section before delivering these remarks, and taken care to avoid the danger of erroneous double counting that can arise in a matter such as this.

Special circumstances

51Counsel for the offender did not submit that I should find special circumstances in this case that would permit a variation of the usual ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence. I have nevertheless considered that question independently. Although this will be the first time that the offender will be in custody for a lengthy period, I consider that the length of the parole period that will be imposed in accordance with the ratio will provide ample time for the offender to be subject to conditional liberty in the community. Accordingly, there will be no variation.

Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006

52I am required by statute to inform the offender that new legislation gives rise to the possibility that, if his rehabilitation in custody does not proceed satisfactorily, he could be subject to conditional liberty or even held in custody, even despite the complete expiration of his total sentence.

Victim impact statements

53A number of victim impact statements were read in court, some by their authors and some on their behalf. They poignantly showed that the physical wounds inflicted that night on the deceased were by no means the only wounds that the offender has inflicted. Deep psychological wounds have been inflicted on her family as well. Those wounds will very slowly heal, but the scars will remain forever. Many members of the family of the deceased have experienced a profound sense of guilt at her death, in light of her isolation from them at the time. That reaction is understandable. But it is misplaced, for there is only one person who is responsible for the death of the deceased. On behalf of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, I extend my condolences to those who have loved and lost Sandra Thomson. Nothing that occurs today can make good that loss, although the end of these proceedings, almost 2 years after the murder, may provide some closure and relief to those who are still suffering. I have dealt with all of the matters in the victim impact statements in accordance with well-established principle: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76.

Imposition of sentence

54Stand up please Mr Ahola. Jouni Risto Ahola, you are convicted of the offence of murder. I sentence you to a non-parole period of 18 years to date from 19 October 2011. That will be followed by a balance of term of 6 years that expires on 18 October 2035. The first date upon which you will be eligible for release to parole is 18 October 2029.

55To be clear, the head sentence is imprisonment for 24 years with a non-parole period of 18 years, to date from 19 October 2011.

2706332,R v Robert Bretherton [2013] NSWSC 1036,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The accused is due to stand trial commencing on 26 August 2013 in Newcastle on an indictment charging that on 16 November 2011 at Bellbird in the Sate of New South Wales he murdered Jodie Jurd. The accused has entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter but not guilty of murder. The Crown has not accepted that plea in satisfaction of the indictment. On 2 August 2013 the accused filed an application pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 for trial by judge alone. He relies upon an affidavit sworn on 1 August 2013 by his solicitor. The application is opposed.

2Section132 is in the following relevant terms:

""132 Orders for trial by Judge alone 

(1) An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a 'trial by judge order'). 

(2) The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone. 

(3) If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order. 

(4) If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so. 

(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness. 

(6) The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner.

(7)...""

3It is convenient and efficient to observe that s 132(4) is the principal provision requiring consideration in the circumstances of the present application. Some attention is also given to s 132(5).

Background

4The accused and the deceased had been in a relationship for approximately ten years. During that time they had separated and reconciled on a number of occasions. The most recent period of separation commenced in October 2010. In May 2011, they decided to try to resurrect their relationship.

5At the time of the offence, the accused and the deceased were seeing a counsellor. The deceased was still residing at a property at Bellbird, which they jointly owned, while the accused was living at Telarah. The accused stayed regularly at the Bellbird address as the house was on the market and he was doing work around the property. The property was sold on 8 November 2011. Settlement was due on 13 December 2011.

6There had been ongoing arguments between the deceased and the accused about a property settlement. They also jointly owned a house in Queensland. It had been proposed that the accused would keep the proceeds of the sale of the Queensland house and the deceased would keep the proceeds of the sale of the Bellbird house. However the accused was not content with that arrangement and wished to revisit it during the week preceding the offence.

7The relationship was characterised by the accused's intense jealousy of the deceased's close relationship with her family. He sought to limit the frequency of her contact with them and did not like her talking to members of her family on the phone. It is alleged that the accused was physically violent to the deceased. She complained to several witnesses that the accused had hit her, kicked her and slapped her, and that it was worse when he was drinking.

8At about 7:35pm on 16 November 2011, Rosalie Keller, who lived next door to the deceased, was outside her house having just arrived home from work. She heard loud voices of the accused and the deceased and loud banging. She described the deceased as screaming hysterically. She ran inside and called ""000"" telling the operator that she was very frightened for the deceased and admitted she had heard similar things on previous occasions.

9Inside the house, the accused had also called ""000"". He said that the deceased at that stage was bleeding, and still breathing. He was told to obtain a cloth or towel. He was asked if the offender was still nearby and he replied, ""Yes"". He was asked if he knew who the offender was. He replied ""Yeah me"". He told the operator the deceased had been stabbed several times, in the chest and abdomen.

10Police arrived around 7:55pm. Constable Nicholson had drawn his taser and the camera device was active. On entering the house the police found the deceased in the main bedroom. She was lying on her side. The accused was kneeling beside her body. The floor was stained with a large quantity of blood. Constable Rowe asked, ""Fucking hell, who did this?"" The accused calmly replied, ""It was me"". Police directed him to move away from the body and lie on the ground face down. He told police that the knife he used was at the feet of the deceased on the ground. He appeared calm and responsive.

11Ambulance personnel arrived but due to the blood loss were unable to revive the deceased. A crime scene was declared. There was physical evidence of a violent struggle, including holes to walls and a quantity of blood. The deceased suffered 12 stab wounds, four to her back, seven to her torso, and one to her cheek. There were additionally defensive wounds to her hands and fingers. One of her fingers had been dislocated.

The legislative framework

12Section 132 commenced on 14 January 2011. It was introduced to remove the former veto power held by the prosecution. Under the new provision, if the prosecutor does not agree to an accused's request for a judge alone order, the Court may make the order ""if it is in the interests of justice to do so"". In his Second Reading Speech, the Attorney-General said this:

""The bill further amends the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to implement a new system for determining when a trial should proceed before a judge sitting alone without a jury. Section 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 allows the accused person in criminal proceedings to be tried by a judge alone if the judge is satisfied that the accused has sought legal advice in relation to the election and the Director of Public Prosecutions consents to the making of the election. The Chief Judge of the District Court proposed in late 2009 that the Director of Public Prosecution's veto power be removed from s 132 by allowing a court to settle the dispute if the prosecution and defence cannot agree on the issue of trial by a judge alone. Judge-alone trials are appropriate in a limited number of circumstances. For example, they may be appropriate where there are concerns that cannot be overcome regarding pre-trial publicity, or where the evidence of the trial is likely to be highly technical.''

13Prior to the introduction of this legislation, if the prosecutor did not agree to the making of a judge alone order, an accused's only recourse was to apply for a permanent stay of the proceedings. This was rarely successful because the courts tended to be of the view that the prosecution's decision not to agree to an order being made was a matter of prosecutorial discretion with which the courts should not interfere. 

14The effect of the new provisions was considered at length by McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; (2012) 217 A Crim R 1. In that case, the Crown appealed against the decision of Solomon DCJ to grant a trial by judge order as a result of the possible prejudice flowing to the accused because he was Muslim, he was charged with an assault on a female family member and because the Crown asserted that he acted as he did because he held ""antiquated"" views about women. In allowing the Crown appeal, the Chief Judge considered the effect of the words ""in the interests of justice"" in the context of an application for a trial by judge order. His Honour referred to the decision in Pambula District Hospital v Herriman (1988) 14 NSWLR 387, where the issue had been considered in respect of civil trials. The effect of the decision in Pambula Hospital was that, before a jury should be dispensed with in a civil trial, it was ""necessary to show grounds which are particular to the case in hand."" His Honour was of the opinion that the legislation did not create a presumption in favour of a trial by jury. His Honour said the following at [96]:

""[96] This appeal raises questions of fundamental importance which the divergence of views in previous decisions confirms are not readily resolved. Although s 131 provides for trial by jury 'except as otherwise provided', I do not think that the section has the effect of creating a 'presumption' that the trial should be with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on an accused person. Although the accused person carries an evidentiary onus the court does not determine where the interests of justice lie by requiring the evidence to rise to a level by which a 'presumption' of trial by jury is displaced. Each mode of trial has its particular characteristics and, accordingly, depending on all of the circumstances relating to the particular case, the court may conclude that the interests of justice are best served by a judge-alone trial rather than trial by a jury. Of course, absent an application by an accused person, the default position will be that the trial must take place with a jury. And, no doubt, when considering where the interests of justice lie, it will be relevant that where the trial involves an issue which may be informed by community standards or expectations the interests of justice may be best served by utilising a jury of laypeople. Subsection (5) acknowledges this consideration. However, I see no reason why the legislation otherwise requires particular weight to be given to the fact that, absent an application for a judge-alone trial, the trial will be with a jury as opposed to by a judge alone. The question for the court is whether it considers it is in the interests of justice to make the order.""

15In agreeing with the orders proposed by his Honour, Hidden J in Belghar commented as follows at [118]:

""[118] I think it is unhelpful to speak about a presumption or an onus when an application is made by an accused for trial by judge alone. The statutory scheme created by ss 131 and 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act is that a trial on indictment is normally by jury, and it is for the accused to raise material which might lead to the conclusion that it is in the interests of justice to depart from that mode of trial. It is then a matter for the judge to determine where the interests of justice lie in all the circumstances of the case, and the approach of the parties to the matter should not be adversarial. While the history of trial by jury suggests that the institution has been for the protection of the accused, it is clear that s 132(4) recognises that there is a community interest in trial by jury which in a particular case might override the accused's preference for a judge alone trial. So much is spelt out in subs (5). To adopt the words of Chesterman JA in Fardon, an accused cannot have a trial by judge alone 'for the asking'.""

Submissions

16The accused has foreshadowed that he intends to raise the issue of the partial defence of substantial impairment pursuant to s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900. A notice pursuant to s 151 of the Criminal Procedure Act has been served. Section 23A is relevantly as follows:

""23A Substantial impairment by abnormality of mind 

(1) A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if: 

(a) at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person's actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and 

(b) the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1) (b), evidence of an opinion that an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is not admissible. 

(3) ...

(4) The onus is on the person accused to prove that he or she is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section. 

(5) A person who but for this section would be liable, whether as principal or accessory, to be convicted of murder is to be convicted of manslaughter instead. 

(6) ... 

(8) In this section: 

'underlying condition' means a pre-existing mental or physiological condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind."" 

17According to the accused, the central issue in the trial will be whether he should be found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter due to the substantial impairment of his mind as the result of an underlying condition. There is competing expert medical evidence before me, some at least of which supports the proposition that the accused is suffering from an Autistic Spectrum Disorder or what was at one time commonly described as Asperger's Syndrome. It is anticipated that these expert witnesses will give evidence in support of the existence and severity of this condition. It is unnecessary for present purposes to refer extensively to this material or to analyse it in detail. It is sufficient to observe that one expert medical opinion upon which it is anticipated the accused will rely contains the following conclusion:

""All this suggests strongly that the accused's Asperger disorder and comorbid depression with or without alcohol related and/or perinatal brain damage caused substantial impairment with regard to his capacity to retain self-control at the time of the killing whilst in the midst of a heated argument with his wife.""

18It can reasonably be anticipated that this opinion will be in contest at the trial and that the Crown will call competing expert medical evidence.

19In these circumstances the accused submitted that it is in the interests of justice for a judge to make the determination in this case. This is said to be at least for the following reasons. First, a judge is likely to be more experienced in assessing and weighing expert opinion evidence. Secondly, a judge is less likely to be inappropriately influenced by the tragic and violent facts of the case, which are to a large extent not in dispute. Thirdly, the accused desires a trial by judge alone and the opinion of an accused person may be relevant to the issue. Fourthly, the trial does not require the application of objective community standards to any significant degree, if at all. The issues of intention or the assessment of expert opinion do, or at least may, not involve the application of community standards. Finally, s 23A(2) prevents evidence of opinion in relation to the degree of impairment being adduced so that the ultimate question for the tribunal of fact is a question of degree rather than one concerned with the application of objective community standards.

20It should be noted that the Crown disputes the last two reasons upon which the accused relies.

21The accused contended that as the central issue in the case revolved around competing expert opinions regarding a medical condition, it was therefore in the interests of justice that the final decision on that issue be supported by reasons given by a judge, rather than that the decision remain shrouded in the uncertain and unverifiable processes of the jury. He cited Martin CJ in Arthurs v State of Western Australia [2007] WASC 182 at [59] and [89] as follows:

""[59] In the limited time available my researches have only identified three decisions dealing with the section. Two of those, The State of Western Australia v Tarau [2005] WASC 290 and The State of Western Australia v Iley [2006] WASC 107, were cases in which the application was granted on the ground that the essential issue for determination was whether the accused person was not guilty by reason of insanity. Because that issue will obviously turn largely upon the evaluation of expert evidence in each of those cases it was considered appropriate to grant the application.
...

[89] Despite their training and experience, it would, I think, be unwise to assume that Judges are any less vulnerable to human emotions and frailty than any other member of the community. However, it is in this context that an obligation to provide reasons appears to me to be of particular significance. Through the performance of that obligation, the accused person, the community and where necessary an appeal court can evaluate whether, and if so the extent to which emotion may have influenced the decision, at least to a greater extent than in the case of a jury verdict. That consideration seems to me to lend weighty support in this case to the proposition that trial by Judge without jury is in the interests of justice.""

22In opposing the application the Crown drew my attention to the speech of the Honourable J W Shaw, the then Attorney General and Minister for Industrial Relations on the occasion of the Second Reading of the Crimes Amendment (Diminished Responsibility) Bill that preceded the ultimate passage of s 23A into law. The Attorney's speech was quite detailed but for presently relevant purposes can be limited to the following:

""The centrepiece of the legislation is the emphasis on the moral assessment to be made by the jury as to whether murder should be reduced to manslaughter in the light of any proven substantial impairment. Some may ask whether this new defence would have led to a conviction for murder rather than manslaughter in Mr Cassell's case. That is a hypothetical and somewhat improper question. Mr Cassell has been lawfully convicted under the present legislation and is serving his sentence. What I can say is that the new defence places increased emphasis on the role of the jury as the appropriate body to assess guilt or innocence when the defence is raised. The new defence also places increased emphasis on the moral assessment by the jury as to whether the evidence warrants the reduction from murder to manslaughter.

...

I turn now to a detailed analysis of the provisions of the bill. Item [1] of schedule 1 repeals the present section 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 and inserts a new section 23A. The new section 23A(1)(a) requires the accused person to prove that his or her capacity to understand events, to judge whether his or her actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. The reference to 'substantially impaired' in proposed new section 23A(1)(a) excludes trivial impairments. The term 'abnormality of the mind' has a restricted meaning in the context of this amendment. Everyone would agree that a person who kills another person is acting abnormally. However, a person charged with murder cannot come within the defence unless they prove that the abnormality of mind affected his or her capacity to understand events, to judge whether his or her actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself.

'Underlying condition' is defined as a pre-existing mental or physiological condition other than of a transitory kind. Proposed new section 23A(1)(b) is the centrepiece of the new defence. It returns the jury to the central position of assessing the culpability of the accused person. Under the old defence of diminished responsibility, some commentators felt that the opinions of the expert witnesses - that is, the psychiatrists and psychologists - dominated the jury's decision as to whether or not the defence succeeded. The new defence returns the jury to the central role by requiring the jury to determine whether the impairment, once established, was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. In coming to its verdict, the jury brings to bear the community's collective wisdom and its sense of justice.

Proposed new section 23A(2) emphasises community values. It does this by preventing expert witnesses from giving an opinion as to whether the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. The experts will only be able to give evidence about whether there was a substantial impairment under proposed new section 23A(1)(a). I will be reinforcing the important role of the jury set out in proposed new section 23A(1) by asking the Director of Public Prosecutions to amend his prosecution guidelines to require prosecutors to take community values into consideration when deciding whether to consent to a trial by judge alone when the accused is charged with murder and has given notice that he or she will rely upon the defence of substantial impairment, and whether to accept a plea to manslaughter on the basis of substantial impairment when the person has been charged with murder.

I accept that this emphasis on the role of the jury may lead to more trials and therefore greater costs to the courts, the Director of Public Prosecutions, defence agencies and the accused. In determining the guilt or innocence of a person for murder or manslaughter, however, costs should not be the only consideration.

...

In conclusion, the bill introduces half a dozen new measures. The amendments emphasise the role of the jury. They give the experts concrete tests by which to assess the impairment of the accused. They do not permit the experts to give evidence about the ultimate moral assessment which the jury must make.""

23The Crown contended in this case that the issue was definitively one that required the assessment and application of objective community standards and as such was one that fell squarely within the purview of a properly instructed jury. I was in that respect referred to the decisions of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Trotter (1993) NSWLR 428 at 431E-G and Adams J in R v Majdalawi [2000] NSWCCA 240 at [36]. The Crown also contended that there were no other factors or issues tending to suggest that it was in the interests of justice to make the order sought.

Consideration

24I do not consider that it is in the interests of justice to make the order sought by the accused. I have had particular regard to his patent concern that issues of a potentially technical nature should not be left to the private ruminations of a jury when the prospect of a misunderstanding of the evidence has the potential to create an irremediable injustice, in contrast to the prospect of an ordered appellate review of any reasons that a judge would be required to provide in support of his or her conclusion on the same issue. There is no doubt that such an argument has an easily understandable, if possibly superficial, forensic attraction.

25The interplay between s 23A(1)(b) and (2) is important. The terms of s 23A(2) make it plain that the decision called for by s 23A(1)(b) is not in fact a medical or technical decision, even if the decision itself is likely, if not certainly, to be one that will have been informed by evidence of that type or character. Section 23A(2) makes it plain, as the Second Reading Speech was at pains to emphasise, that the factual matter requiring determination is at large, and is not in any way to be constrained or limited by expressions of opinion about it. It is abundantly clear that the opinion is one that calls up consideration of an objective community standard, being whether the extent of the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. That is a question upon which minds may differ, but is nevertheless an evaluative question that cannot, and ought not, be foreclosed. 

26The anterior question with which s 23A(1)(a) is concerned is in a different category. Medical opinions upon it and about it appear likely to figure prominently in the trial. It does not involve the determination of assessment of an objective community standard or indeed any other form of standard at all. It involves a question of fact to be decided with the legitimate benefit of expert medical evidence. Despite the concerns expressed by the accused about it, that is a decision of a type upon which juries are asked regularly to confer on something approaching a daily basis. It does not, and in my view in this case it ought not, derogate from the importance of leaving the s 23A(1)(b) issue to the jury in this case.

27For the reasons I have given, I consider that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards. It is for that reason not in the interests of justice to order that the trial proceed before a judge alone or that a trial by judge order be made.

		06 August 2013",2013-08-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706335,Black v R [2013] NSWCCA 183,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  I agree with R A Hulme J that the present application is to be understood as a challenge to the jury verdict on the ground that it was unreasonable, or could not be supported, having regard to the evidence: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1).  Having considered all of the matters raised by the applicant, including the transcript of the text messages which was not in evidence (but is referred to by R A Hulme J), in accordance with the principles identified in Lee, Do Young v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [196]-[210], I agree with R A Hulme J that the application should be dismissed.
2R A HULME J:  Mr Stephen Black (""the applicant"") was arraigned on 26 May 2008 before Coolahan DCJ and entered pleas of not guilty to four counts of aggravated sexual assault (s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)), two counts of indecent assault (s 61L), one count of inciting an act of indecency (s 61N(2)) and one count of larceny (s 117).  
3On 13 June 2008, a jury returned verdicts of guilty for each of the sexual offences and a verdict of not guilty for the larceny offence.  The applicant was sentenced on 11 December 2008.  
4An application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence was filed on 19 September 2011. There was some confusion at the hearing about whether an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal was required.  It has since been found that the Registrar of the Court extended time until 30 October 2011. 
5The applicant appeared in person in respect of his application for leave to appeal against conviction.  He informed the Court that consideration is being given by Legal Aid New South Wales to the proposed appeal against sentence.  It would seem his case is among those that are being reviewed in the light of the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.  While it is undesirable that there be separate hearings in relation to conviction and sentence, in the circumstances it seems appropriate to proceed to determine the conviction aspect of the proceedings.
6The Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal identifies seven ""Points of Appeal"".  Written submissions, which were prepared with some legal assistance, were filed by the applicant on 11 December 2012.  They include the following overriding assertion:
The grounds for this appeal against conviction are that when viewed collectively, the inconsistencies in the victim's testimony, a lack of any substantial DNA evidence and certain factual errors contained in other evidence presented at trial is such that the verdict of the jury in respect of the offences upon which I was convicted is unreasonable or cannot be reasonably supported.
7The ""grounds"" addressed in the written submissions do not conform with the ""points of appeal"" identified in the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal.  I have combined and reformulated the contentions in both documents into a number of topics.  I accept the characterisation in the written submissions for the respondent that they should be regarded as particulars of an overall assertion that the verdicts of the jury are unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence:  s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
Overview of the competing cases at trial
8The applicant and the complainant were mature single adults who lived in separate houses in Orange.  They met in January 2005 at a social gathering at the home of the complainant's neighbours and struck up a friendship.
9The prosecution case was that they were platonic friends, but the applicant desired a romantic relationship.  A letter that he gave to her on 28 February 2006 (Exhibit A) demonstrated that he wanted a romantic relationship but that she was not interested.  In the early hours of the morning of 6 March 2006, the applicant broke into the complainant's home, threatened her with a knife and sexually assaulted her multiple times.  Shortly afterwards, the complainant rang her boyfriend and told him what had happened and he advised her to go to the police.  She attended the police station and was later examined at hospital.  DNA material consistent with the DNA profile of the applicant was found on an item in the complainant's bedroom.  The applicant's alternative characterisation of the relationship and explanation for the presence of his DNA was disputed.  
10An important feature of the prosecution case was that there was no definitive assertion by the complainant that the applicant was her assailant.  It was dark in the bedroom and she did not see him clearly.  However, based primarily on certain things that the assailant said, she believed that he was the applicant.  For this reason, the prosecution case relied significantly upon circumstantial evidence.
11The defence case was that the applicant and the complainant commenced a sexual relationship about a month after they met, however she kept the relationship a secret from her friends and family.  He did not break into her house or sexually assault her on 6 March 2006.  His DNA was found in her bedroom because he had sexual intercourse with her on the night of 3 March 2006 and he had been there on other occasions as well.  The complainant was not a truthful and reliable witness.  Her assertion that the assailant was the applicant was incorrect.  In his closing address to the jury the applicant's counsel submitted that the questions for the jury to determine were (a) whether there was an intruder in the complainant's home on 6 March 2006; (b) if so, whether that intruder sexually assaulted her and stole her money; and (c) whether that intruder was the applicant. Detailed review of the prosecution case  12The complainant gave evidence that a friendship developed after meeting the applicant at her neighbour's home, about 12 months before the attack.  They came to see each other three or four times a week, mainly when he would accompany her when she walked her dog.  They went on social outings together to shows, concerts and the like.  The applicant bought her presents and lent her money.  One loan was to enable her to retrieve something she had on lay-by at K-Mart.  On occasions he questioned her about other men being interested in her; he accused her of sleeping with other men.
13The complainant made it clear that she wanted only friendship whereas he indicated that he wanted more.  He never said that he loved her but he did indicate that he wanted a sexual relationship. There were two occasions when he inappropriately touched her and she rebuffed him: at a concert at the Ex-Servicemen's Club in Orange in March 2005 and at the applicant's home on Christmas Day in 2005.
14The complainant's evidence was to the effect that she began to lose enthusiasm for the friendship around Christmas 2005.  Phone records indicated that they had regular contact in 2005 but this tapered off around or after Christmas.  She said she was ""distancing herself from him"".  She said that she made a few calls to him in January or February 2006 asking him not to ring her.  She said this to him in person as well (AB 440).  In about February 2006, she had told him not to come to her house anymore and to stop leaving messages on her phone; she wanted to be left alone (AB 419).
15On 26 January 2006, the complainant met a man with whom she commenced a relationship.  To preserve the anonymity of the complainant I will refer to him as ""Paul"".  
16On Tuesday 28 February 2006, the applicant went to the complainant's home.  He had an envelope in his hand and told her that he had not expected her to be home.  She was on her way to an appointment and told him that she did not have time to talk.  When she returned later she found an envelope at the front door.  She took it inside but did not open it until the following evening.  The letter became Exhibit A in the trial and was relied upon by the prosecutor in arguing that the relationship between the pair was in fact as the complainant had described, and not how the applicant sought to portray it.  The letter, which need not be reproduced here, was a lengthy statement of unrequited love. 17Paul came to the complainant's home on 28 February 2006. He stayed overnight and was there late in the afternoon of 1 March when the applicant came to the front door.  The complainant answered the door and the applicant said in an angry tone, ""Why did you do this to me"" and ""You've led me on"".  She told him to leave and shut the door. The following day, Thursday 2 March, the applicant left a voicemail message apologising for his behaviour. 
18On Friday 3 March, the complainant worked until 4.00pm, then did some shopping and went home.  She denied seeing the applicant that day and denied his account that he came to her home and had sexual intercourse with her.
19There was nothing eventful about Sunday 5 March.  But in the early hours of the morning of Monday 6 March, the complainant was woken and saw a dark shadow in her bedroom.  A man put a knife to her throat and said, ""don't scream or I'll fucking kill you"".  He thereafter sexually assaulted her in a variety of ways that constituted the various counts in the indictment.  In short, there was digital penetration of her vagina, vaginal intercourse, an indecent assault constituted by biting her left breast, anal intercourse, the incitement of an act of indecency by having her take hold of his penis, vaginal intercourse again, and another indecent assault by placing a vibrator against her vagina.
20During the course of all of this the assailant said various things which were of significance to the prosecution contention that he was the applicant.  The following table sets out some of those things and refers to evidence relating to them:
""How many people have you slept with?""The complainant said that the applicant had questioned her about other men sleeping with her.""You were married once so you must have slept with him"".The applicant's evidence was that the complainant had told him she had previously been married.""Steve's got to go to court today and it's all your fault"".Steve was the applicant's name.  Detective McLean said that when he spoke to the applicant on the morning of 6 March he said that he had to go to court that day.""Maybe I could sleep with your son's girlfriends [sic], she's got a good set of jugs"".The accused had met the complainant's son and his girlfriend.  The girlfriend gave evidence.  The prosecutor referred to her in his closing address as ""a well developed young lady"".""The woman that stays with you when you have TAFE do you open the door and watch her having a shower"".Barbara Merrick-Bassett was doing a weekend course with the complainant at TAFE.  As she lived on the other side of Bathurst she used to stay with the complainant on those weekends.  The applicant had met Ms Merrick-Bassett on such occasions.
21The complainant said that by this stage she thought the man was the applicant.  This was because of his voice and what he was saying:  things he knew about her and her general activities.  There was anger, bitterness and resentment in his voice.  It sounded like he was trying to disguise his voice by making it deeper.  She said, ""He was trying to disguise his voice and it was like he was there on behalf of Steve, it was like he was pretending to be there on his behalf"" (AB 443).  There was also the fact that he slipped sometimes from referring to ""Steve"" or ""he"" to ""I"".  Another factor was that he was sweating a lot; while on top of her his sweat was dripping onto her face and chest.  (The complainant said that on another occasion she had observed that the applicant sweated ""quite profusely"" and the applicant himself agreed that he did sweat a lot ""if it's a hot day"".)   There was also the fact that his chest was hairy. (The applicant agreed he had a hairy chest.)  She did not want to confront him with her recognition because she was scared that he was going to stab her with the knife.
22Other things the assailant said that supported the complainant's belief that he was the applicant were:
""Why did you take him down to meet your father?""It was common ground that there was an occasion when the complainant and the applicant went down to Cootamundra where he met her father.""You're going to ring Steve today. You're going to invite him around for tea tonight.  You're going to have sex with him tonight.""An unlikely thing for someone other than the applicant to have said.""When youse are together you're not going to make any more lay-bys and you're going to start paying for things.""The applicant had lent the complainant money to enable her to retrieve an item she had on lay-by. 23The complainant's evidence was that she had purchased a vibrator in October 2005 when she was with a girlfriend and it was bought as a joke.  She had never used it; it was still in its original packaging and was on the bedroom floor.  Prior to this, the applicant had asked her whether she had one.  She had told him that she did not, which at that time was the case. 
24Towards the end of the incident the assailant said, ""Oh look what we have found here on the floor ... I thought you didn't have one, I thought you didn't use one"".  She said she then felt something being shoved between her legs; it was her vibrator.  
25The complainant's mobile phone was on a bedside table.  The relevance of this will emerge later in a discussion of one of the applicant's contentions.
26At the end of the assault the assailant threatened that he would come back and kill the complainant if she reported the matter to the police. He left and she heard the front door shut.  She went to the bathroom, put a dress on and returned to the bedroom where she looked for her mobile phone which had been on a bedside table.  She could not find it. She went to the kitchen to get her handbag and car keys and found her phone on the bench.  She left via the front door and noticed that the sensor light did not come on; it should have because the switch inside the front door was always left on.  (The applicant agreed that he knew the location of the sensor light switch.)
27She drove away from her home and then stopped and called Paul.  She told him that she had been raped by the applicant.  He implored her to go to the police station.  She did so.  She told one officer, and then another, that it was the applicant who had raped her.  She was examined at the hospital by Dr Howe and swabs were taken.  When she was asked for her Medicare card she looked in her wallet and saw that there was $220 missing (this was the subject of the larceny count for which the jury returned a verdict of not guilty). 
28Cross-examination of the complainant raised two matters where her account was in conflict with that of witnesses beyond just the applicant.  One matter concerned events on Christmas Day 2005 where her recollection was inconsistent with that of the applicant, his stepson and the then girlfriend of her son.  The other matter concerned an occasion when the applicant and two witnesses, Craig and Bernadette Daniels, said that the complainant and the applicant went to the Daniels' home in Kelso for dinner and ended up staying the night and sharing a bed.  The complainant was adamant in denying such an occasion.  I will say more about those two matters when dealing with the applicant's arguments on the application.  Otherwise the cross-examination did not yield any concessions or expose any matters that significantly damaged her credibility.
29Dr Howe said he examined the complainant at about 6.40am on 6 March 2006.  Amongst other things he observed redness on the side of her neck and he also saw some redness around the posterior fourchette and the anus.  The latter were consistent with ""some vaginal trauma or penetration"" and ""some trauma or penetration of the anus"" (AB 511).  There were minor abrasions on the right arm that the complainant attributed to her dog.  Dr Howe observed that the complainant was tearful and upset during the examination but speaking rationally and coherently.  She gave him a history which was generally consistent with the evidence she gave before the jury, although for understandable reasons it was nowhere near as detailed.
30Paul gave evidence which was consistent with that of the complainant.  He confirmed her account of the applicant coming to her home on 28 February 2006 when Paul was inside.  He heard a man outside the front of the house say, ""I suppose you're sleeping with him too are you?""    31Paul said that he received a call from the complainant at about 3.40am on 6 March. (It was in fact 3.35am according to telephone records (Exhibit J).)  She told him, ""I woke up and he was standing there, he had a knife, he grabbed me"".  He asked if she was alright and she replied, ""It was Stephen, I know it was by the things he said"" (AB 471). 
32Paul said that he saw the complainant at Orange police station.  She was distraught.  She accompanied him back to his home in Sydney.  The next morning he saw bruises on the tops of her arms and ""like real fine cut lines"" on both her arms.
33Constable Stacey Evans spoke to the complainant when she came to the police station at about 3.40am.  She said the complainant was crying and shaking and said, ""I've just been sexually assaulted, he broke into my house and I know who did it"".  She was taken to a waiting room where she was asked what happened.  The complainant said:  
""It was Stephen Black. We were friends but I told him a couple of weeks ago that I didn't want to be friends with him.  He had a knife and he must have a key. ... He held a knife to me and I know it was him but he was speaking like it wasn't and that he was there for Stephen but he slipped up a couple of times, like when he was saying Stephen he said ""I"" a couple of times.""
...
""I met him through a neighbour and known him about 12 months and we've only been friends, nothing more.  A couple of weeks ago I told him I didn't want to see him anymore even as friends because he was scaring me and saying stuff like, 'People are looking at you and they want to have sex with you'.  He still calls 12 to 14 times a day.""  (AB 477)
34Constable Evans asked the complainant whether she knew how the assailant got in and she replied, ""No. I saw my glass sliding door open, the front door was locked but the deadlock was unlocked"".
35Detective Sergeant Andrew McLean was recalled to duty and spoke to the complainant.  He described her as ""probably bordering on being hysterical, extremely distraught, carrying, shaking and very emotional"".  Her account was in terms consistent with what she had said in her evidence and with what she had told Constable Evans.  It included that the assailant had said, ""Isn't Steve good enough for you?  He bent over backwards for you and you threw him aside"". 
36Detective McLean went to the complainant's home to make a cursory examination.  He found that a rear sliding door was ""very loose"".  When he tried that door a piece of metal broke off.  He said, ""I believe it was the latch inside the actual door frame that hooks onto the striking plate on the door frame"".  He did not detect any sign of forced entry to the home. 
37Detective McLean then went to the applicant's home at about 6.45am.  The applicant was told of the sexual assault and that the complainant believed he was responsible.  He replied, ""What? That's ridiculous"".  After he was placed under arrest and cautioned he said, ""Yeah but I didn't do it I have [sic - haven't?] seen or spoken to her for weeks"". 
38The applicant was taken to the police station where he exercised his right to silence.  A buccal swab was taken and he was released from custody pending DNA analysis of the swab.  
39Detective McLean caused a fingerprint expert to attend the complainant's home.  It was reported to him that no ""identifiable fingerprints"" were found; meaning that there were fingerprints but that they could not be identified because of their condition.
40Inquiries were made at Mudgee Hospital and records were produced to confirm that the applicant had undergone a vasectomy in 1988.  This is relevant to the finding of no sperm in the semen detected in the high vaginal swab taken from the complainant.
41Senior Constable Brett Sansom made a detailed examination of the crime scene.  He noticed the damage to the rear sliding door and considered it to have been the point of entry.  He was unaware that damage had been caused earlier in the morning when Detective McLean had entered the home.  Various swabs were taken for the purpose of DNA analysis.
42The rear sliding door led to a small sunroom that was enclosed and had a screen door.  The screen door had a locking device but the officer agreed in cross-examination that it ""wasn't a very secure sort of door"" (AB 547).  The sliding door itself had the usual type of locking device but also had a bolt at the top.  He could see that in photographs shown to him by defence counsel but said that he had not noticed it during his examination at the scene (AB 549).
43The woman who had been the girlfriend of the complainant's son (""Hayley"") gave evidence.  She had met the applicant at the complainant's home in March 2005.  On subsequent occasions when she had seen the applicant he told her that he liked the complainant.   A couple of weeks before 6 March 2006 he spoke with Hayley and told her that he did not understand why the complainant did not want to sleep with him.  He asked, ""how could I win her heart over?""  He also commented about buying her presents but that she never bought him presents in return. 
44Hayley said that on all of the occasions she saw the complainant and the applicant together there was never anything more than friendship.  They never touched, kissed or held hands.
45The complainant's former neighbours, Terrence and Lynne Hazzard, gave evidence about the applicant meeting her at a social gathering at their home in early 2005.  They also gave evidence of their subsequent observations of the pair and of things the applicant said about the relationship; it was generally to the effect that there was a friendship only, but that the applicant had wanted more.
46The applicant arrived at the Hazzard home in the late afternoon of 6 March 2006.  He told them of having been spoken to by police about the rape of the complainant.  He spoke of having had sexual intercourse with the complainant the previous Friday (3 March) and expressed concern that his DNA might be found.  Mr Hazzard asked him where he had been last night and he said that he was at home watching movies.
47Ms Jenina Moore, the applicant's next door neighbour, was made available by the prosecutor for cross-examination.  She agreed that she had said in her police statement that at 3.26am on 6 March 2006 she had noticed the headlights of a car coming into the applicant's driveway.  She thought the car looked like one that belonged to the applicant's daughter.  A short time later she noticed the front lights on at the applicant's house.
48The applicant's stepson, Warrick Cromie, gave evidence that he saw his father's car in Summer Street, Orange (the main street) at around 6.30pm on 3 March 2006. In cross-examination he said it could have been earlier, between 5.30 and 6.30pm. 
49Mr Cromie gave evidence about the events of Christmas Day 2005.  I will say more about it later.
50Mr Cromie also gave evidence that was relevant to the observations made by Ms Moore, the neighbour.  He was at the applicant's home on the night of 5/6 March 2006.  He said the applicant went to bed at about midnight.  Mr Cromie went to bed a short time later but set his alarm for 2.45am when he went out to visit a friend, Nathan Gates.  He returned at about 3.30am, driving into the driveway with headlights on.  His car was not of the same type as that which the applicant's daughter owned but they were both small and white.  Mr Cromie said that he left to go home at about 5.00 or 5.30am but put his head in the door of the applicant's bedroom to say goodbye and saw he was there, asleep.
51The prosecutor was granted leave to cross-examine Mr Cromie pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  He was challenged as to his claim to have visited Nathan Gates.  He said they just spoke about things they had done on the weekend and also about something to do with Mr Cromie's computer because Mr Gates used to fix it for him.  Mr Cromie agreed that he did not see the applicant from midnight until between 5.00 and 5.30am.
52Nathan Gates, Mr Cromie's friend gave evidence that Mr Cromie visited him in the early hours on a couple of occasions, although he could not recall whether this occurred on 6 March 2006.
53Barbara Merrick-Bassett was the woman who attended TAFE with the complainant about one weekend a month and stayed with her on those occasions.  Her evidence included that she received a call from the complainant in which she complained of having been raped.  The complainant said that it was dark but that, ""It was Stephen I could smell him"".   She also said, ""He mentioned your name while he was raping me"".
54Ms Sharon Neville, a forensic biologist, gave evidence about the DNA analysis of items recovered from the complainant and her home.  This is the subject of one of the contentions raised by the applicant and so I will review the evidence later. Detailed review of the defence case  55The applicant gave evidence denying that he was the intruder and denying that he sexually assaulted the complainant.  56He said that he met the complainant in early 2005 and a friendship developed.  The relationship became a sexual one after about a month.  However, the complainant did not want anyone to know this.  When they were with her friends they portrayed a platonic friendship but when they were with his friends they displayed their feelings more openly.
57The applicant said that the letter he delivered on 28 February 2006 (Exhibit A) was written by him but his daughter had helped him to compose it.
58On 1 March 2006, he went to the complainant's home but she would not let him in.  He asked if someone was there - ""You know, we're supposed to be together, have you got a bloke in there?""  He called out, ""If you're in there come out"" but there was no response so he left.  That night the complainant called him; she was crying and apologised for upsetting him.  She still wanted to stay friends.
59On Friday 3 March, he saw the complainant in Summer Street ""between 5.30 and 6 o'clock I think from memory"".   He also said ""it was around about between 6.30 and 7.00. I'm not sure of the exact time"".  She asked how he was and he replied, ""All right I sort of met someone else"".  She responded ""Would you like to come back for a drink back to my place because I wanted [sic] to stay friends?""  He accepted the invitation.  They met at her home. He went inside and they had an orange juice in the lounge room.  She went up the hall and returned, wearing just a man's shirt and underpants.  She kissed him, straddled him on the lounge; ""then things got heated and we ended up in the bedroom"" where sexual intercourse occurred.  He left ""a bit after 8.00, 8.30 approximately"" because he had to drive to Dubbo to visit Ms Faye Schinck, his new lady friend. 
60The applicant returned to Orange on the Sunday (5 March).  His son was there.  He went to bed at midnight.  His son woke him as he was leaving at about 5.00am.  He got up about 15 minutes later and got ready because he had to go to court that day.  Shortly after that the police came.
61Later on 6 March, the applicant went to the home of Terry and Lynne Hazzard.  He wanted to talk about the allegation that he had sexually assaulted the complainant.  He told Mr Hazzard that he had sex with her the previous Friday.  A lawyer had told him that DNA takes two to three days to leave the body ""and I thought well, you know, I'm going to be in the shit because I was there on the Friday"". 
62The applicant gave evidence about other aspects of his relationship with the complainant.  He spoke of an occasion when they had stayed overnight at the home of Craig and Bernadette Daniels at Kelso.  They slept in the same bed but there was no sex because she was concerned about the noise; the Daniels' bedroom was next door.  
63The applicant denied the conversation with Hayley in which he is said to have asked about winning over the complainant's heart. He said the complainant had told him about buying a vibrator; he saw it when he was in her bedroom on 3 March 2006 and it was on the floor but not in its packaging as she had said.  He also gave evidence about buying things such as jewellery for the complainant and about lending her money.
64The applicant's credibility in relation to a number of aspects was raised during the course of cross-examination.
65He denied saying to Detective McLean that he had not seen or spoken to the complainant for weeks.  He then claimed that the detective had asked whether he knew the complainant and he said he did.  The detective then asked ""Have you seen her lately?""  He had previously been told by lawyers not to admit to anything until you talk to a lawyer so he replied, ""No"".  He agreed that this was a lie.  
66The applicant was challenged about his account of having had sexual intercourse with the complainant on 3 March 2006.  He was forced to concede that his recollection of time was, in effect, unreliable when he was confronted with telephone records that showed that the complainant was using her landline in a call to Paul from 5.54pm to 6.30pm.  That did not occur while he was at the house.  But he maintained that he met her down the street at about 6.15 or 6.30pm, having said elsewhere in his evidence that it was between about 5.30 and 6.00pm or 6.30pm and 7.00pm.  He denied that he had made up a story that was tailored to account for the DNA evidence.
67The applicant was invited to explain some of the things he had said in the letter to the complainant he delivered on 28 February.  When he wrote, for instance, ""I just wanted to hold you and being held by you but I knew you wouldn't have wanted that"", he meant that he was sick of them hiding their relationship.  He also claimed that he could not read and got help from someone to write it out and he then copied it.
68Paul Ross, a good friend of the applicant, gave evidence that he saw him with the complainant at the Cowra Bike and Car Show in early 2005.  He said they appeared to be ""a fairly happy couple"".  At one point she sat on his lap; they seemed to be flirtatious.
69Bernadette and Craig Daniels gave evidence about an occasion in early 2005 when the complainant and applicant came for dinner at their home in Kelso and stayed the night.  During the evening the applicant had his arm around the complainant on the lounge.  Mr Daniels said they appeared to be like any other normal loving couple; they held hands, cuddled and gave the occasional peck on the cheek.  They slept in the same bedroom which was next to the Daniels' bedroom.  In cross-examination they were asked what the complainant looked like and neither of them could remember much.
Contentions supporting the ground that the verdicts were unreasonable
Contention:  the complainant lied about the events of Christmas Day 2005
70The complainant attended the applicant's home on Christmas Day in 2005.  There were discrepancies in their respective accounts of the circumstances.  The applicant contended that the complainant fabricated an assertion that at one point while they were alone in the lounge room he attempted to unbutton her blouse.  Her motive in doing so was to support her claim that he had an unrequited sexual desire for her which in turn would support her claim that he sexually assaulted her on 6 March 2006.
71The complainant's account was that she had lunch elsewhere and went to the applicant's home after.  It was after his daughters had left that he sat beside her on the lounge and ""he was trying to unbutton my blouse and I got really annoyed [and] told him to stop and I got up and left"" (AB 386).  In cross-examination she said that by Christmas she was ""distancing myself from him"" (AB 444).
72The applicant's account of what occurred at his home on this day was put to the complainant in cross-examination.  She disputed that the applicant's daughter was not present but that his stepson and granddaughter were.  She also disputed that she had arrived at the home in the company of her son and his girlfriend and that they had travelled in her son's car. (AB 432-433). The applicant gave evidence in accordance with that version.  He said that the complainant, her son and his girlfriend arrived between 10.00 and 10.30am; they stayed for lunch and left together at about 3.00pm. 
73Hayley, who was the girlfriend of the complainant's son at the time, agreed in cross-examination that the applicant's account as summarised above was correct.  She also agreed that when they left in the afternoon, the applicant and the complainant ""were on good terms"" (AB 503).
74The applicant's stepson was cross-examined by the applicant's counsel about this occasion and his account was consistent with that of the applicant (AB 526-528).
75A theme of the closing address to the jury by the applicant's counsel was that the complainant was ""not a truthful, honest or accurate witness"" (AB 767).  He submitted that in the face of the evidence of the applicant and other witnesses, the jury would find that the complainant had lied about the events of Christmas 2005 and that she had done so to support her contention that by this time she was ""distancing herself"" from the applicant.  The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the jury would accept that the complainant was mistaken in her evidence about this occasion but that it did not detract from the credibility of her account of more significant events (AB 784).
76In my view, it is unlikely that the jury would have regarded this topic as significant in their assessment of the complainant's testimony about critical matters; nor should they have.  There were far more significant matters pointing to the correctness of the complainant's description of the relationship; for example, the letter (Exhibit A).
Contention:  the DNA and fingerprint evidence was consistent with innocence
77Semen was detected on the high vaginal swab but no sperm was found.  For this reason, the Division of Analytical Laboratories did not carry out any DNA testing.  Ms Sharon Neville, forensic biologist, explained that with the absence of sperm, the chance of getting a DNA profile of the man who was the source of the semen was too low.  One of a number reasons why there might not be sperm was if the man had undergone a vasectomy (which the applicant had).  
78There was a new testing procedure (Y-chromosome testing) available that could have been used.  For funding reasons such testing was not done routinely.  There was also the fact that the expectation of getting a meaningful result in the circumstances of this case was minimal.  One of the reasons for that is that there is no statistical calculation that can be made as to the occurrence of any DNA profile that the testing might reveal.  Its use is limited to excluding a person if the profiles are inconsistent.
79Dr Brian McDonald was an expert called in the defence case.  It was his opinion that the Y-chromosome testing should have been carried out even if only to see if the applicant was excluded.  The applicant does not raise any issue about this aspect of the DNA evidence so no more needs to be said about it.
80Ms Neville also gave evidence that because of the presence of two components in the semen it was likely that the semen had been deposited within 48 hours of the swab being taken.  Dr McDonald said he was not familiar with any studies that can look at the presence of the two components Ms Neville had referred to in order to time when semen had been deposited.  So, he said that without further information he doubted that a figure could be given about how long semen had been present when there was no sperm.  Again, the applicant does not raise any issue about the evidence on this topic:  it was not said to contribute to the unreasonableness of the verdicts.
81Two DNA profiles consistent with that of the applicant and the complainant were recovered from two human hairs on the vibrator.  This was the subject of considerable contest in the evidence of Ms Neville and Dr McDonald (for example, whose DNA was from the hair as opposed to something that was on the hair?).  In the end, however, the fact remained that DNA consistent with both individuals was found.  The Crown argued that it supported the complainant's account whereas the defence contended that the applicant's DNA could have got there from his previous presence in the bedroom (for example, the vibrator was on the floor and so too may have been his shed hair).
82The point the applicant sought to make the most of in relation to this part of the evidence was that his DNA was not detected on things that the assailant was said to have touched:  the bedside drawer, the door latch, the bed head, and the complainant's mobile phone.  It was also not detected on the bed sheets, the pillow cases or the doona cover.  The assailant wiped himself on something after he had ejaculated, perhaps on the complainant's nightdress, yet his DNA was not found there either.
83Ms Neville said that swabs from the bedside drawer, the door latch and the bed head were tested and they revealed a DNA profile consistent with the complainant.  There was also trace DNA recovered from the bedside drawer and the bed head but they were too weak to interpret.  
84The bed sheets, pillow cases and doona cover were tested at a later date.  The mobile phone was not tested. No semen was detected on the flat bed sheet, the pillow cases or the doona cover.  But DNA testing on seminal stained areas of the fitted sheet revealed a profile consistent with Paul; a profile consistent with the complainant; and a male profile too weak to interpret except to say that Paul could be excluded.
85The applicant submitted that if the assailant was sweating heavily, wiped himself on the nightdress and touched various items as the complainant had described, his DNA would have been found on the majority of the items.
86The problem with this contention is that the lack of sperm in his semen meant that his DNA would not have been detected from any semen deposits arising from these activities.  Further, DNA of unspecified origin was recovered from the bedside drawer, the bed head and the fitted sheet but was too weak to interpret.  
87The applicant also contended that if the vibrator was on the floor but still in its original packaging as the complainant had said, it would be expected that his fingerprints would have been found on the packaging if he had been the assailant.  There was no suggestion that the assailant was wearing gloves.  This, it was submitted, supported the applicant's claim that he was not present and did not commit the offences.
88The problems with that submission are, first, that it is not the case that there were no fingerprints found at all.  The evidence was that there were no identifiable fingerprints. As Detective McLean explained, there were fingerprints but they could not be identified because of their condition.  Secondly, if identifiable fingerprints should have been found, they would at least have included the complainant's; but hers were not found either.  So, the fact that the applicant's fingerprints were not found on this, or any other item, is entirely neutral, just like the absence of detection of his DNA profile on anything other than the hairs on the vibrator is neutral.
89The trial judge told the jury that the DNA evidence was ""too inconclusive"".  That is understandable given that there were competing explanations for how the applicant's DNA may have found its way onto the vibrator.  The judge directed that if they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the applicant's guilt on the basis of all of the other evidence in the case, ""the DNA would not be sufficient to get the Crown over the line as it were. You would have to acquit the accused"" (AB106).  
90If the DNA evidence was of any significance, it was that there was none found that was inconsistent with anyone other than the complainant, the applicant and Paul.  That is, there was no DNA indicating the presence of a fourth person.  So, rather than the DNA (and the fingerprint) evidence being consistent with the applicant's innocence, the better view is that whilst it did not establish his guilt, it was not inconsistent with it.
Contention:  the complainant lied about cuts on her arm because the cuts were not seen on medical examination
91The complainant said that on the morning after the assault (Tuesday 7 March) she noticed fine cuts on the top of her left arm.  She showed them to Paul.  She also said that when she was examined by Dr Howe the previous morning she had a scratch on the top of her right arm which her dog had caused.
92The applicant submitted that because the cuts on the left arm were not seen by Dr Howe, ""it would not be that those fine cuts were suffered and inflicted ... during the alleged assault"".  Counsel for the applicant had submitted in his closing address to the jury, ""She had you believe that as a result of the knife, there were fine cuts on her left upper arm"" (AB771).
93These submissions do not acknowledge that the complainant never said that she suffered those cuts as a result of anything the assailant did to her.  The prosecutor should not have led the evidence.  He submitted to the jury that there was an inference that the cuts were caused by the knife (AB790).  Counsel for the applicant raised no complaint; indeed he attempted to use the evidence to the applicant's advantage by submitting that it derogated from the complainant's credibility.  
94As unmeritorious as the prosecutor's submission was, it is extremely unlikely that the jury would have paid it any attention.  The judge reminded the jury that the complainant had not attributed the cuts to the sexual assault (AB49).  And in any event, the issue was trivial in the context of there being many more significant matters for the jury to consider.
Contention:  the evidence as to the point of entry of the intruder was confusing to the extent that a reasonable jury could not have followed it 
95I have referred earlier to the evidence of Detective McLean and Senior Constable Sansom about what they observed about the rear sliding door and the screen door the sunroom outside that sliding door. 
96The applicant's submissions refer to matters within the statements of Detective McLean and of the complainant.  The statements were not before the jury.  They do not constitute ""fresh"" or ""new"" evidence that may be admitted on appeal. 
97The applicant's point appears to be that the rear sliding door and sunroom screen door could not have been the point of entry for the intruder as Senior Constable Sansom had thought; he not being aware of damage to the sliding door locking mechanism that had occurred earlier when Detective McLean was at the home.  This contention is not raised to dispute that the applicant was the intruder.  It is raised to dispute the existence of an intruder at all.
98The complainant told Constable Evans that after the assault she saw that the rear sliding door was open and the front door was closed but not deadlocked. 
99I accept that there was no definitive evidence about how the assailant entered the home.  The only evidence about the police examination of the scene that supported the proposition that the applicant was the assailant was that the sensor light at the front of the house had been turned off and there was evidence that the applicant knew where the switch for it was. 
100It must be possible that the complainant had left a door unlocked and was mistaken or had forgotten this, or the applicant through his frequent attendance at the home had contrived a means of surreptitious entry.  The evidence was such that this was a matter left to speculation.  However, the fact of damage by Detective McLean did not establish that the sliding door could not have been the point of entry or that it had not been forced.  It merely established that the evidence was equivocal and the matter was not properly investigated.
101But the evidence was overwhelming on the question of whether the complainant had been sexually assaulted by an intruder.  There is no other sensible explanation for the complainant fleeing her home at around 3.30am, ringing her boyfriend and complaining of being raped, and then going to the police station, again complaining of being raped.  She was in a state of considerable distress and still was when she was examined by Dr Howe.  He observed redness around the posterior fourchette and anus that he said was consistent with trauma or penetration.
102Counsel for the applicant at trial has practised in criminal law for a great many years.  It is inconceivable that someone with his experience would have overlooked an opportunity to make a submission to the jury that would have advanced his client's interests.  But nothing was said in his closing address to the jury about the ""point of entry"" issue at all.  This indicates to me that in the atmosphere of the trial it was of no significance.
103The applicant also made submissions about photographs that became exhibits in the trial and about what he said were inaccurate descriptions of what they depicted.  I have considered what he has said and viewed the photographs.  I am satisfied that the point has no relevance to the issues.  Again, it is unsurprising that no-one raised any such concern at trial.
Contention: the complainant's evidence was unreliable because there were inconsistencies between what she said in her police statement and what she said in evidence at trial and there were things said by her in evidence at trial which were illogical
104Statements made by the complainant were not in evidence.  For the reason given earlier, they must be disregarded except to the extent that she was cross-examined about them.
105Other points raised by the applicant in this context are of dubious significance.  For example, the complainant was uncertain about whether she stayed with Paul on the night of 6 March 2006 at his home or in his truck (he was a truck driver), whereas he said they stayed at his home.  The complainant said that she woke to find a dark shadow, a person, ""he was on my right standing next to the bed"" whereas Dr Howe recorded that her history included that ""she woke up and saw a dark figure next to her in bed"".  She said that the intruder had a shirt on but the shirt had moved up, whereas Dr Howe had recorded her as having said ""he had taken his shirt off"". 
106None of these matters are of any real significance and that is consistent with the fact that the applicant's counsel said nothing about them in his closing address.
107Another matter raised by the applicant was that the complainant said the intruder bit her on the left breast.  The applicant's counsel observed in his closing address that she did not say anything about whether there was any mark or injury caused and neither Paul or Dr Howe said anything about it.  None of them were asked about it and there was no evidence that any mark or injury should necessarily have been expected.
108The applicant contended that text messages he received from the complainant were inconsistent with her claim that she was trying to distance herself from him; that she did not want to go to his place on Christmas Day 2005; and that in January or February 2006 she made a few phone calls to him and asked him in person not to call her (AB 387; 440-1; 444).  
109The text messages the applicant referred to had been transcribed and the document was annexure ""H"" to his written submissions.  The applicant conceded that his counsel had taken a decision not to tender the document and the trial transcript bears that out (AB 621; 760).  In these circumstances the evidence does not qualify as ""fresh"" or ""new"" evidence and could not be admitted on appeal.  I have, nevertheless, perused the document and cannot see anything of significance that supports the applicant's case.
Conclusion
110The principles concerning the determination of a ground of appeal that a verdict of guilty is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, are well known and need not be restated here.  The question is whether it was open to the jury, in the sense explained by the High Court of Australia, to conclude beyond reasonable that the applicant was guilty of the various sexual offences charged: M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; Jones v R [1997] HCA 56; 191 CLR 439; MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; and SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.
111I have reviewed the record of the trial and the various contentions raised by the applicant. 
112There was good reason to accept that the relationship between the applicant and the complainant was as she, and not he, described.  The letter (Exhibit A) was indicative of this.  There was also the evidence of what he had said to Hayley and to Terrence and Lynne Hazzard. 
113As I indicated earlier, the complainant's immediate complaint, her distress, and the injuries noted upon medical examination made it unrealistic to consider that there had not been a sexual assault perpetrated by an intruder as she claimed.
114There were a number of features of the prosecution's circumstantial case that strongly supported the proposition that the applicant was the intruder.  In this connection I have had particular regard to the comments made by the intruder; the intruder's knowledge of the premises (the location of the sensor light switch); the physical attributes of the intruder (hairy chest and profuse sweating); a car arriving at the applicant's home at a time consistent with him having just departed from the complainant's home; the semen recovered in the high vaginal swab being consistent with its source having had a vasectomy as the applicant had; and the presence of the applicant's DNA on the vibrator.
115The applicant has not suggested that there is anything inconsistent with the jury having found him guilty of the sexual offences but not guilty of the count of larceny.  The complainant did not discover what she thought was the missing $220 from her wallet for some hours after her assailant had left and in that time she had been at the police station and the hospital.  The judge invited the jury to consider whether the money ""might have gone missing"" at one or the other of those places.  His Honour observed, ""there was no real evidence as to her having the purse always in her control from when she left the house until she checked the money at the hospital"" (AB33).  The judge also acceded to a submission by the applicant's counsel that the jury be directed that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the amount missing was exactly $220.
116None of the matters raised by the applicant, even in their combined force, are sufficient to cause me to have a reasonable doubt about his guilt.  In fact, they are so lacking in merit that I would refuse leave to appeal.
Order
117I propose that leave to appeal against conviction be refused.
118GARLING J:  I agree with R A Hulme J, for the reasons he gives, that the application for leave to appeal against conviction should be refused.

		06 August 2013",2013-08-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706358,JD v R [2013] NSWCCA 198,"Judgment

1THE COURT : This is an application pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 seeking leave to appeal against an interlocutory ruling by Wells SC DCJ refusing a temporary stay of the applicant's trial on charges relating to the sexual assault of a child between 10 and 14 years of age, sexual intercourse without consent and aggravated indecent assault.

2The application came before the Court on 9 August in anticipation of the trial commencing on 12 August at Lismore District Court. After the hearing of the matter, the Court refused leave. The following are the reasons for that decision. 

3The charges date from late 2003 to late 2005. The allegations were not reported to police until November 2011. The applicant was charged in December 2011. The trial date was set when the applicant was arraigned on 13 March 2013. 

4On 19 July 2013, the Crown advised the applicant's solicitor that the Crown would be making an application to the court that the complainant, who is now 20 years of age and resides in South Australia, give evidence in the trial by way of audio-visual link. The Crown provided a medical certificate dated 8 July 2013 which established that the complainant was then 30 weeks pregnant and had been advised against travelling by plane to attend the trial. Her due date is 11 September 2013. 

5On 29 July 2013, the applicant's solicitor applied for an adjournment of the trial on the basis that it would be unfair to subject the ""heavily pregnant"" complainant to ""the rigours of cross-examination"". It was further asserted in an affidavit by the applicant's solicitor in support of the Notice of Motion of 26 July that :-

The court has an obligation not only to the complainant but also her unborn child to consider their health and safety in the context of a jury trial and that the medical material support the contention that they are especially and temporarily vulnerable at this time.

6In addition, the applicant's solicitor raised the prospect of an unfair trial, in that the jury would be unduly sympathetic towards the complainant, because the jury may not be able to distinguish between the emotions of the complainant attributable to her pregnancy from those attributable to giving evidence of the alleged assaults.

7A further consideration in support of the application was the need to take the complainant to a number of documents, items and photographs in the course of cross-examination. As to this last ground, the applicant maintained that the complainant should be available within the court precincts albeit in a remote location from the courtroom in order for this to occur.

8The applicant's solicitor also relied upon a medical certificate in relation to his own health, which established that the solicitor was under investigation and management for stress-related chest pains. The applicant's solicitor also pointed to the fact that there was another sexual assault trial listed in the same week which could proceed in lieu of the applicant's trial.

9The judge refused the application. The judge noted the bases of the application and the complainant's wish that the trial proceed on the nominated date. The solicitor's health was not regarded by the judge as a relevant matter, given the age of the allegations and the priority usually accorded sexual assault trials. The applicant's solicitor was advised that the matter should be reallocated if he felt unable to appropriately instruct counsel at trial. The judge also rejected the fact that there was another trial listed in the same week as an appropriate or proper reason for the vacation of the applicant's trial.

10On 1 August 2013 the applicant renewed his application by way of a further notice of motion and a supporting affidavit from the applicant's solicitor. This notice of motion dated 29 July 2013 sought a temporary stay of the trial until such time as the complainant was sufficiently able to attend. The affidavit in support of this notice of motion indicated that the applicant opposed the complainant's evidence being given from South Australia on the basis that it ""is extremely prejudicial to the [applicant] for the complainant to appear in the circumstances"", that it would be ""unfair to subject a complainant so heavily pregnant to the rigours of cross-examination in a jury trial and highly prejudicial to the [applicant]"". 

11Once again, the submission was made that the jury would feel undue compassion for a pregnant complainant and interpret the proper cross- examination of the complainant as inappropriate and traumatising. The submission that the court had an obligation to the complainant and her unborn child was repeated in the same terms as outlined above, as was the submission in relation to the need to show the complainant a number of documents in cross-examination. It was submitted that any attempt to put these items in cross-examination by way of facsimile ""would prove a logistical nightmare and impracticable in the circumstances."" 

12The applicant's solicitor reiterated that his health had further deteriorated and that as a result he had reduced his workload substantially by way of operating as a legal consultant. It was submitted that the applicant was not in a financial position to engage the services of any other legal representative. The solicitor claimed that he was unable to confirm that he could continue to instruct in the trial.

13The judge again refused the application. The judge considered that any prejudice flowing from the fact that the complainant would be giving evidence in an advanced state of pregnancy could be cured by appropriate directions to the jury. The applicant's concerns about the complainant's fitness to withstand the rigours of cross-examination were noted. However, the judge observed that the complainant wished the matter to proceed and that she considered herself well enough for that purpose. The judge had regard to the other matters raised in support of the application and was not persuaded that they justified the vacation of the trial date.

14The application did not suggest in terms that the direction that the complainant give evidence from South Australia is outside the ambit of the legislation. Parts 2 and 4 of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (the Act) include the following provisions :-

7(1) A NSW court may, on the application of a party to a proceeding before the court, direct that evidence be taken, or submissions made, by audio link or audio visual link, from a participating State.
(2) The court must not make such a direction if: 
(a) the necessary facilities are unavailable or cannot reasonably be made available, or 
(b) the court is satisfied that evidence or submissions can more conveniently be given or made in this State, or 
(c) the court is satisfied by a party opposing the making of the direction that the direction would be unfair to the party. 

20A Evidence must not be given, and a submission must not be made, by audio visual link under this Act unless the courtroom or other place where a NSW court is sitting, and the place where the evidence would be given or the submission would be made, are equipped with audio visual link facilities that enable: 
(a) persons who are at the courtroom or other place to see and hear the person giving the evidence or making the submission, and 
(b) persons who are at the place where the evidence is given or the submission is made to see and hear persons at the courtroom or other place. 

20E If in the course of examination of a person by audio link or audio visual link it is necessary to put a document to the person, the NSW court may permit the document to be put to the person: 
(a) if the document is at the courtroom or other place where the court is sitting, by transmitting by any means a copy of it to the place where the person is giving evidence or making a submission and the copy so transmitted being then put to the person, or 
(b) if the document is at the place where the person is giving evidence or making a submission, by putting it to the person and then transmitting by any means a copy of it to the courtroom or other place. 

15However, on the hearing of the application, it became clear that the applicant was essentially submitting that the test under s 7(2)(c) was not correctly applied by the judge. The submission was that the judge erred in failing to consider whether allowing a heavily pregnant complainant to give evidence and be subjected to strenuous cross-examination would give rise to prejudice to the applicant, in that a reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the applicant would not receive a fair trial.

16In support of this submission, the applicant relied upon this Court's decision in MG v R [2007] NSWCCA 57 ; 69 NSWLR 57, in particular at [65] to [66] and [70]. Those paragraphs contain uncontroversial statements concerning the right to a fair trial, by reference to Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23, and Subramaniam v R (2004) 211 ALR 1. They do not, however, include a reference to a reasonably informed member of the public. That concept appears at [68] in the following context :-

Application of the principle is relatively uncomplicated when the suggestion is of actual bias in a judicial officer or juror. It is more complicated when the suggestion is that the judicial officer or juror is affected by apprehended bias. In that case ""the governing principle is that ... a judge is disqualified if a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. That principle gives effect to the requirement that justice should both be done and be seen to be done"" p 344. (italics not in original)

17Thus, the Court makes plain that the ""fair minded lay observer"" is the touchstone for the ""governing principle"" in cases of apprehended bias on the part of a judicial officer or juror. MG itself was a case concerned with the apprehension of bias on the part of the Crown Prosecutor. It is not authority for the proposition that a test such as that proposed by the applicant has any part to play in determining whether a direction under s 7 of the Act is unfair to the opposing party. 

18The applicant further submitted that he could not receive a fair trial while the complainant was in the advanced stages of her pregnancy because her ""vulnerable condition"" would necessarily constrain counsel in her cross-examination of the complainant (citing s 41 of the Evidence Act 1995, and the New South Wales Bar Association Rules). Additional factors relied upon included the possibility that the stress of giving evidence could precipitate labour and result in the trial being aborted at considerable expense to the applicant, the fact that the jury would feel a ""heightened level of sympathy"" for the complainant on account of her condition, and anger or revulsion at defence counsel's attack upon a pregnant woman in the course of a forensically appropriate cross-examination.

19Finally, the applicant also relied upon the need to show the complainant at least 40 documents during cross examination without advance notice. It was submitted that it was not logistically possible to do so without compromising the forensic advantage to the applicant.

20The answer to these submissions lies in the broad powers of the trial judge to manage the trial process. There is no evidence supporting the proposition that the complainant's condition is ""vulnerable"" or that there is any prospect of an early labour. There is no substance to the submissions concerning the potential reactions of the jury to the cross-examination of a pregnant complainant in circumstances where the complainant is capable of being viewed in the course of the trial in a manner that does not disclose her pregnancy. 

21Section 41 of the Evidence Act provides for the rejection by the trial judge of misleading, confusing, unduly annoying, harassing, offensive, insulting, intimidating, oppressive, humiliating and repetitive questions in cross- examination. The Bar Rules essentially replicate this provision. There is no basis for concluding that responsible and experienced counsel cannot effectively cross examine a pregnant complainant without falling foul of these precepts. The complainant's pregnancy has no relationship with the issues at trial. 

22The applicant acknowledged that it was entirely feasible for a sealed folder of copy documents to be sent to South Australia and placed in the possession of a court official for production to the complainant at the relevant stage in her cross-examination. There is no reason to think that any forensic advantage would be lost if those arrangements were made and carried into effect.

23There was no error in the exercise of the judge's discretion or in the application of the relevant test for the purposes of the Crown's application under the Act.

		28 August 2013",2013-08-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706359,R v Kearnes; R v Paton [2013] NSWSC 1139,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1Peter John Kearnes and Christopher John Paton were charged with the murder of Semin Rizvic (to whom I shall refer in this judgment as ""the deceased"") some time ago. They have been arraigned in this Court previously to today, and their trial is set down for hearing in the Supreme Court at Albury on 3 September 2013. The indictment contains a single count of murder alleged against both accused, and the proposal of the Crown is that a joint trial be conducted.

2Mr Kearnes moves upon a notice of motion filed 31 July 2013 seeking a trial separate to that of Mr Paton. An affidavit of the solicitor for Mr Kearnes of the same date has been filed and read on the motion. The documents annexed to it, including but not limited to the Crown case statement, have provided me with a useful overview of the Crown case. 

3The Crown Prosecutor opposes the order sought in the motion. Senior counsel for Mr Paton has indicated that his position with regard to the resolution of the motion is essentially neutral. All parties have filed very helpful written submissions.

The allegation and the evidence in support of it

4The allegation in short is that, in the early hours of 21 July 2011, Mr Kearnes and Mr Paton travelled by car from Tumut to Wagga Wagga. There, pursuant to a joint criminal enterprise to kill, the deceased was shot a number of times to the head and neck, causing his death. The motive is alleged to be ill feeling on the part of Mr Kearnes towards the deceased as a result of a romantic relationship between the deceased and the former wife of Mr Kearnes. There is also some suggestion that Mr Kearnes believed or suspected that the deceased was somehow involved in the sexual assault of children.

5An important witness in support of the proposition that Mr Kearnes and Mr Paton committed the murder is a woman to whom I shall refer to as ""Ms T"". At the time she was in a brief romantic relationship with Mr Kearnes. She provided the police with an interview in which she gives detail as to the events of that evening and its aftermath. No doubt her evidence will be the subject of forensic attack, not least because, as I understand it, she had previously provided police with more than one statement to the effect that she knew nothing.

6Other evidence includes phone records that show that a mobile phone associated with Mr Kearnes was in use in Wagga Wagga at the time in question, and that it was in communication with the phone associated with Ms T and also a Mr Minogue. The Crown position is that the telephone records with regard to Mr Kearnes go some way to supporting the evidence of Ms T.

7There is also evidence of the sighting of a car at the scene that is broadly similar to a car associated with Mr Kearnes and Ms T.

8Furthermore, two witnesses from the scene, Ms Gordon and Ms Douglas, engaged in picture identification parades some months after the shooting. 

9Ms Douglas did not pick a photo of Mr Kearnes from a picture identification parade that contained a photograph of him. With regard to a picture identification parade that included a photograph of Mr Paton, Ms Douglas selected three photographs, one of which was a photograph of Mr Paton. She described herself as being ""pretty adamant and sure"" that the photograph of Mr Paton depicted the man whom she had seen in the stairwell of the apartment block of the deceased on the evening in question.

10As for Ms Gordon, when shown a selection of photographs that included a photograph of Mr Kearnes, she said that two photographs had a similar appearance to a man whom she had seen standing at the rear of the vehicle in the vicinity of the scene at the time in question. Neither of those photographs was a photograph of Mr Kearnes. As for her engagement in a picture identification parade containing a photograph of Mr Paton, she selected two photographs as being similar in appearance to a man seen sitting in the front passenger seat of the vehicle. The first photograph was a photograph of Mr Paton.

11A palm print was developed from an area within the apartment block consistent with where one of the witnesses had seen a man standing. That palm print is said by a fingerprint expert to be identical to that of Mr Paton.

12As well as that, there is CCTV evidence from the vicinity of the scene that is said to show, with reasonable clarity, the presence of Mr Paton.

13Whilst in custody on remand, it is alleged that Mr Kearnes confessed the fatal shooting to another prisoner whom he had known for years, a man to whom I shall refer to as ""Mr J"". Indeed, the position of Mr J is not only that Mr Kearnes confessed shooting the deceased, he also sought to hire Mr J to have Ms T murdered in order to silence her. It is also said by Mr J that Mr Kearnes admitted that at one stage he had sought to kill Mr Paton in order to silence him as well, but the plan had to be abandoned at the last minute.

14That evidence of a prison informer will no doubt be subject to trenchant criticism by counsel and strong warnings by me, in light of the circumstances in which it has been provided and, I presume, the character and credibility of Mr J. However, the Crown asserts that the things Mr J has said that Mr Kearnes said to Mr J about the shooting could, to state it simply, have only been known by a person who was, at the least, present at the shooting.

15That evidence, forming as it does an alleged admission well after the completion of the alleged offence, is led by the Crown only against Mr Kearnes. In any event, although Mr J claims that Mr Kearnes said that he had committed the murder with the assistance of another man, Mr J does not assert that Mr Paton was referred to by Mr Kearnes by name.

16Separately, but in similar vein, the Crown case against Mr Paton is that he confessed his involvement in the shooting to his aunt, Ms Mary Schwind. It is said that that lady has known Mr Paton since he was born and has been a part of his life since then. She states in short that, in late October 2011, Mr Paton told her that he was at the scene, but did not ""do it"". She said that Mr Paton said that Mr Paton, Mr Kearnes and Ms T travelled to Wagga to ""sort out a bloke"". To state the evidence of Ms Schwind succinctly, she says that her nephew said that he was present, went up to see the deceased along with Mr Kearnes and Ms T, but had absented himself at the crucial time in a search for cigarettes. I assume the Crown case will be that the admission of Mr Paton that he was present is correct, but the assertion that Ms T was present is incorrect, as is the proposition that he had fortuitously absented himself and missed all of the fatal violence.

17Senior counsel for Mr Paton informed me that the evidence of Ms Schwind will be the subject of firm dispute. Again, that evidence is led only against Mr Paton. 

18Later, Mr Kearnes and Mr Paton were found to be travelling together in a car towards Sydney. That is consistent with the evidence of Ms T that, after the shooting, they decided to leave Tumut and head north. 

19Each accused engaged in an interview with police in which he professed his innocence and claimed not to have been in Wagga Wagga that evening. In the case of Mr Kearnes, the Crown will seek to submit that that was a lie, told as a result of consciousness of guilt on the part of Mr Kearnes. Again, if permitted to make that submission, the Crown has made it clear that it would only be part of its case against Mr Kearnes.

Basis of application

20The submissions in support of the order sought are simple. It is submitted that the evidence of Ms Schwind against Mr Paton will be an important part of the case against him. It is one thing, it is said, for a prison informer to give evidence against a fellow prisoner. It is quite another for a close relative who has known an individual since the day he was born to implicate him in a murder. Counsel for Mr Kearnes submits that the evidence, whilst by no means the only evidence against Mr Paton, will assume a significant role in the Crown case against him, and he submits that it will be an important part of the deliberations of the jury with regard to Mr Paton, especially in light of the fact that it will be the subject of dispute. Counsel for Mr Kearnes also submits that the evidence of Ms Schwind may well be dramatic and have attached to it human interest, in light of the relationship between the witness and Mr Paton, and that could add to the impression it makes upon the jury.

21And yet, he submits, there is no doubt that by way of what he is alleged to have said to his aunt, Mr Paton was directly inculpating Mr Kearnes in the shooting. Indeed, what Mr Paton allegedly said to his aunt could be said to be largely exculpatory of Mr Paton. And yet, counsel submits, the jury will be expected to put out of its minds completely the evidence of Ms Schwind about what Mr Paton said about Mr Kearnes when it comes to consider the Crown case against Mr Kearnes.

22In other words, counsel for Mr Kearnes submits that, during their deliberations, the jury will be called upon to examine closely what was said by Mr Paton in considering the Crown case against Mr Paton, but disregard entirely what was allegedly said by Mr Paton when considering the case against Mr Kearnes. In fact, he submits, that it is an impossible expectation of mental gymnastics to be undertaken on the part of the jury.

23He also submits that, when one considers the strength of the Crown case against each accused, and accepting that the bulk of the evidence will be admissible against each man, including most of the evidence establishing the presence of the other man, nevertheless it can be said that the evidence against Mr Kearnes is substantially weaker than the evidence against Mr Paton.

24In short he submits that the well-established test in R v Middis (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 27 March 1991, unreported) has been made out, and, even despite the extra time, trouble and expense involved, there should be two trials.

25The Crown Prosecutor accepted that the evidence of Ms Schwind would not be admissible against Mr Kearnes, and that there would need to be firm and repeated directions to that effect. However, he emphasised that our criminal justice system operates on the general assumption that juries obey directions of trial judges. He also submitted that the balance of convenience is overwhelmingly in favour of there being a joint trial, in that many witnesses would have to give evidence twice, and perhaps two to three weeks of extra court time would be needed to accommodate two trials as opposed to one. Finally, he suggested that, even at this stage, there is perhaps a developing flavour of a cutthroat defence (at the least on the part of Mr Paton), and that is a factor that militates in favour of a joint trial.

26As I have said, senior counsel for Mr Paton has adopted a neutral position.

Legal principles

27The following propositions can be derived from the authorities.

28The general rule is that crimes alleged to have been committed jointly should be prosecuted in a joint trial: see R v Beavan (1952) 69 WN NSW 140, Assim v The Queen [1966] 2 QB 249, Webb v The Queen; Hay v The Queen [1983] HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41.

29However, the exception to that rule is if there is a real risk of positive injustice in the conduct of a joint trial: see Guimond v The Queen (1979) 44 CCC 481, R v Darby [1982] HCA 32; (1982) 148 CLR 668 and Gulder v The Queen (1986) 8 NSWLR 12.

30In a case such as this, where there is an alleged admission directly admissible against one accused but completely inadmissible as hearsay evidence against another accused, it has been said that that question can be resolved by considering three questions: see R v Middis, approved in R v Baartman (Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, Gleeson CJ, Powell JA and Smart J, 6 October 1994, unreported). 

31First, is the evidence against the applicant for a separate trial significantly weaker and different to the evidence admissible against the other accused?

32Secondly, does the evidence against the other accused contain material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him?

33Thirdly, is there a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material? 

34It has been said that if those three aspects are made out, a separate trial will usually be ordered.

35It has been said more recently that the question of comparison of the relative weaknesses and strengths of the cases against each accused should not be regarded as an overly determinative factor: see R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190 and R v Lu; R v Pham [2007] NSWSC 1141.

36It has also been said that, in this context, ""immeasurably"" does not mean enormously, but rather in a way that cannot be quantified with precision: see R v Pham.

37The cases establish that questions of cost and convenience are not irrelevant: see R v Oliver (1984) 57 ALR 543, R v Middis and R v Dellapatrona; R v Duffield (1993) 31 NSWLR 123.

38It has also been said in the latter case that the question involves a degree of balancing of factors.

39The cases have emphasised that the ordering of separate trials is not automatic simply because there will be some evidence led in a joint trial that is inadmissible against one accused: see Gulder v The Queen. If there is a cutthroat defence apparent, that is more supportive of there being a joint trial: see R v Ignjatic (1993) 68 A Crim R 333.

40It is the case that the common law proceeds on the assumption that juries obey directions from trial judges. As McHugh J said in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [31]:

""The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions.""

A little later his Honour said in the same paragraph:

""Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.""

41On the other hand, as Gleeson CJ and Gummow J said in the same case at [13]:

""The system of criminal justice, as administered by appellate courts, requires the assumption, that, as a general rule, juries understand, and follow, the directions they are given by trial judges. It does not involve the assumption that their decision-making is unaffected by matters of possible prejudice.""

Determination

42Applying the principles that I have reviewed and sought to summarise to the evidence as currently revealed at this early stage, I must say that the matter is finely balanced in my mind. The bulk of the evidence is admissible against both accused. It will undoubtedly be inconvenient, time-consuming, expensive, and to some degree oppressive to witnesses, not least Ms T, if they are called upon to give evidence twice.

43It could also be said that the evidence of Ms Schwind about what Mr Paton is alleged to have said, whilst undoubtedly important, is not absolutely paramount in the Crown case against him.

44On the other hand, there is force in the submission of counsel for Mr Kearnes that the testimony of Ms Schwind could well be, at least to some degree, dramatic, emotive, and impressive. As I understand it, it is the only evidence of an admission by Mr Paton, and it comes from a close relative. Perhaps it could also be said that it has the ring of truth (in the sense of it having been said by Mr Paton) in that it features a substantial degree of exculpation.

45It is true that the direct evidence against Mr Kearnes includes the phone records, some evidence of motive, and a more direction connection with a Ford Territory. It is also true that the evidence of Mr J may well have its strength as well as its weaknesses. 

46But in light of the identification evidence pertaining to Mr Paton, the CCTV evidence with regard to him, and the evidence of the expert with regard to the palm print found in a location consistent with the evidence of one of the eye witnesses, and although I do not consider that the evidence against either man is particularly weak, on the material before me currently, I do consider that the Crown case against Mr Kearnes is weaker than the Crown case against Mr Paton.

47Furthermore, with regard to juries obeying directions of trial judges, it is one thing to be comfortably satisfied that juries do indeed apply directions such as the need for proof beyond reasonable doubt, or the need to respect the right to silence of any citizen. It is quite another for a jury deliberating in a murder trial to compartmentalise the evidence of Ms Schwind to such a degree that they fully take it into account against Mr Paton, but disregard it entirely against Mr Kearnes. That is a task that professional judges would, I respectfully consider, find difficult to perform, let alone 12 citizens.

48With regard to the balancing exercise, as I have said, two trials will be inconvenient to a very substantial degree. On the other hand, I do not think it inappropriate to take into account in that exercise the fact that the allegation against Mr Kearnes is an exceptionally serious example of an exceptionally serious offence. And the loss of two to three weeks of court time, whilst regrettable, can sometimes be necessary to ensure a fair trial of a count that carries a maximum penalty of life without parole. 

49Finally, with regard to a second trial, and indeed the first, I am confident that the involvement of very experienced counsel will permit there to be substantial and appropriate shortening of the evidence and the legal aspects of the trial.

50In short, whilst I accept that the general rule is that an allegation of a joint crime should be made at a joint trial, and whilst I accept that two separate trials will be inconvenient in a number of different ways, I consider that there has been established that there is a real risk of a positive injustice being occasioned to Mr Kearnes if a joint trial were conducted. And I consider that the specific test enunciated in R v Middis has been made out. 

51As a result I make the following order: 

(1)The trials of Peter John Kearnes and Christopher John Paton for the murder of the deceased are to proceed separately. 

52I will proceed to hear submissions from the parties as to which trial should proceed first, and will then make a ruling with respect to that question. Thereafter, we shall immediately proceed to have a pre-trial mention and discussion of the first trial.

2706363,R v Gogani [2013] NSWDC 280,"sentence


1HIS HONOUR: Yashar Gogani appears today for sentence in relation to two charges to which he pleaded not guilty at trial, but in respect of which he was found guilty by a jury in May this year. The first count alleges that he, between 27 January 2011 and 22 March 2011 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, conspired with Neil Pettersen, Terry Faumuina and other unknown persons to break and enter the premises of Perfume Network of Australia Pty Ltd situated at 142 James Ruse Drive, Rosehill and to commit a serious indictable offence therein, namely larceny, in circumstances of aggravation, namely in company with Neil Pettersen, Terry Faumuina and other unknown persons. The second count on the indictment alleged that he, on or about 20 March 2011 at Rosehill in the State of New South Wales did steal an Isuzu truck, registration BB58UH, the property of Jamil El Helwa. 

2In relation to the conspiracy offence, this is an offence at common law and the maximum penalty is described by the Crown as being at large. I note at this early stage that I sentenced the co-accused, Mr Pettersen, last year, who appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal and the appropriate maximum penalty or, alternatively, the appropriate considerations to determining an appropriate penalty for that offence in the context of it being a common law offence, were discussed in that judgment. I adopt, obviously, that Court's reasoning, bearing in mind of course that it relates directly to the very matter for which I must sentence this prisoner. Count 2 in the indictment carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period for either count.

3Mr Pettersen, as I mentioned, had been sentenced by me in respect of count 1 on this indictment. The matter in count 2 was taken into account on a Form 1. It is obvious that the sentence that I imposed on Mr Pettersen is directly relevant to consideration of the appropriate penalty for this prisoner in respect of the conspiracy. The taking of the motor vehicle was an act in furtherance of the major charge, that is the conspiracy charge, and for that reason, notwithstanding potential issues that arise in accordance with what I have described as Pearce principles (Pearce v The Queen [1998] 194 CLR 610 at [45]), I am of the view that any sentence for the motor vehicle offence should be entirely concurrent with the sentence for the conspiracy offence. The totality of the criminality reflected by the two offences is fully accounted for in the sentence for the conspiracy matter, having regard to all the relevant facts, particularly the fact that the taking of the vehicle was, on the Crown case, and clearly so, for the purposes of committing the conspiracy offence.

4The evidence at the trial establishes that Mr Gogani and Mr Pettersen were clearly partners in the formulation and execution of the criminal agreement to commit the substantive offence that was intended. It is not entirely clear in the facts that related to Mr Pettersen that this may have been so, but it became abundantly clear when I had the opportunity, unlike when I sentenced Mr Pettersen, to hear the many telephone intercepts of conversations between the two men, to hear respective offenders, particularly Mr Gogani, discussing other matters reflecting acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.

5During these various conversations Mr Gogani was actively making plans, recruiting people or attempting to recruit people and making other preparations in respect of the criminal agreement which was pleaded in the indictment and clearly so on the evidence, extended from at least 27 January 2011 or thereabouts to 21 March 2011. In this matter the issue of parity of sentencing clearly arises for consideration and in that regard I have paid close attention to decisions of the High Court discussing parity of sentencing such as Postiglione v R and the authorities therein cited, as well as decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal including the decision from 2010 of Jimmy v R. As Justice Rothman summarised it by reference to Aristotelian principles of equality. The parity of a sentencing principle reflects the general proposition that alike shall be treated alike and unalike shall be treated unalike to the extent of their unalikeness.

6In relation to the facts in this matter, as established from the evidence, Mr Gogani and Mr Pettersen from late in January 2011 agreed to and planned to break into a large commercial premises occupied by, what I understand to be, a perfume wholesaler and retailer that traded under the name of the Perfume Warehouse. This was owned by a company called Perfume Network Of Australia Pty Ltd, the corporate entity identified in the indictment. The premises were located at 142 James Ruse Drive, Rosehill on the western side of that road between the Rosehill Racecourse and the Parramatta River. The business, the Perfume Warehouse, was conducted within a complex of other businesses and warehouses in the vicinity of 142 James Ruse Drive.

7The evidence at the trial revealed that the Perfume Warehouse in March 2011 had several million dollars in stock. As I understand the evidence, the business had a warehouse which stored perfume and related products as well as offices and a retail outlet that faced on to James Ruse Drive. The prisoner and Mr Pettersen, continued their preparations and planning in relation to their plans for this premises up until the early hours of 21 March 2011. Unbeknownst to them, although they endeavoured to disguise their conversations with crude code, they were the subject of telephonic and other electronic and visual surveillance over the period of time particularised in the indictment. 

8On 1 February 2011 they were observed, parked on the opposite side of James Ruse Drive from the Perfume Warehouse in a car park of other commercial premises making observation of the building in company with Mr Faumuina. Mr Faumuina is a co-accused who pleaded guilty in a late sentence. Mr Gogani was the subject of other surveillance at various times including a meeting with associates of Faumuina and him, as I would understand it, at a McDonald's restaurant in the western suburbs of Sydney. The telephone conversations of the prisoner to Mr Pettersen surrounding this meeting and its purpose were in evidence before the jury. That meeting occurring in March of 2011, approximately ten or eleven days before the conspiracy came, effectively, to an end.

9The evidence revealed that other people were, in some way, connected to the plans as outlaid by the prisoner Mr Pettersen. For example there was reference to a man called Eric. His role was not clearly defined. It seemed from the telephone conversations the prisoner had, and other references to Eric, that he was a person with some particular expertise, whether that was expertise in safe breaking or some other matter necessary to complete the crime, I am unable to conclude. There were other people of course involved in meetings between the prisoner and others.

10Only Mr Pettersen, Mr Gogani and Mr Faumuina have been arrested and charged in relation to this offence. Ultimately, even though Mr Faumuina is in the middle of giving evidence in his sentence proceedings, precise particulars of what they proposed to steal have not been made clear. Not only was Mr Gogani involved in recruiting people to assist in the commission of the crime and making other plans, he attended upon a Bunnings store in the North Shore on 8 March and bought a number of implements which, on the Crown case, were to be used in the proposed crime including a set of bolt cutters, an axe and a pair of gardening gloves.

11As far as the case was conducted before the jury the evidence revealed that it was intended that the crime, after some delay and at least one postponement, was to occur on the morning of 21 March 2011. Initially it was proposed that an agreed crime be committed sometime in February but the plan was postponed.

12On 20 March 2011 in the evening, Mr Gogani picked up Mr Pettersen from, as I understand it, Cammeray and they travelled to North Parramatta on the other side of the river, as I would understand it, from where the Perfume Warehouse was located. Unbeknownst to them at that stage, at least, they were under heavy surveillance at this point and from that surveillance and the telephone intercepts it was clear that the conspiracy was coming to a head, so to speak. In a suburban area of North Parramatta, they parked nearby to where the motor vehicle, the subject of count 2, was located. They got out of Mr Gogani's car and approached that vehicle and subsequently Mr Pettersen was seen to drive the vehicle away and Mr Gogani drove his motor vehicle, obviously in convoy, with the vehicle driven by Mr Pettersen.

13At the trial some issues were raised as to whether the vehicle, the subject of count 2, the Isuzu truck, was seen by police later that morning in the place where Mr Pettersen had left it. But this fell away on examination of the evidence and no convincing issue arose that might provide a basis for a reasonable doubt as to the prisoner's involvement with Mr Pettersen in its unlawful taking.

14In relation to the surveillance of the two men, the van was parked in a street some short distance to the rear of the Perfume Network. The only conclusion one can reach was that it was taken and parked in that position to be used later as some sort of carriage vehicle for the proceeds of any crime committed within the Perfume Warehouse premises. In the very early hours of 21 March 2011 the prisoner Mr Pettersen drove away from where the van had been left and it would seem that at that point either they were aware that they were under surveillance, or they were travelling away for some period of time before activities relevant to their conspiracy would be resumed.

15Some few kilometres on the other side of the Parramatta River from where the van was abandoned, it is clear that Mr Gogani and Mr Pettersen became suspicious of the surveillance. As it came to pass they pulled into a street off Victoria Road in, what I understand to be, Rydalmere and parked the car that Mr Gogani was driving. Mr Pettersen got out of Mr Gogani's car and walked back to another vehicle which in fact contained a surveillance officer, who tried to secrete himself, if that is the correct expression, obviously unsuccessfully. Shortly afterwards the prisoner sent an unequivocal text message, or at least an unequivocal text message was sent from a mobile phone within the prisoner's control, which indicated to others, particularly Faumuina, that the job was off because they realised that they had been compromised.

16As I said the taking of the van was an act in furtherance of the conspiracy and in my view consistent with totality principles and consistent with the approach taken to Mr Pettersen's sentencing, although the taking of the van was on a Form 1, no additional term of imprisonment should be imposed for that offence that accumulates upon the sentence for the conspiracy. Of course, in accordance with Pearce principles, I need to have regard to particular matters including imposing a separate sentence for each offence and then turning my mind to the issues of concurrency and accumulation by regard to principles of totality.

17As I understand the matters that were raised at the trial in answer to the Crown case, a trial at which the prisoner did not give evidence, whilst it may have been conceded, as was clearly so, that there was an agreement to commit a crime at the Perfume Warehouse, the jury may have had a reasonable doubt as to what precisely that crime was. There was no doubt that the Perfume Warehouse was the target. The coded conversations and telephone intercepts, the attendance upon the premises to check them out, the location of the dumping of the stolen vehicle, all point to that business as being the target of any intended crime. As it turned out, although it was argued in a number of the submissions put on behalf of the accused, that some other crime may have been committed eventually and thus the prisoner should be found not guilty of this crime, the jury were properly satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the agreement involved an intention to commit the crime pleaded by the Crown.

18Of course it may have been said that there was contemplated another crime, as a matter of argument, but ultimately the only other crime that one could think that was to be committed was a crime of robbery or something similar, which would not have made the criminality any less than what it is at the present time.

19As to the various people in the affair, Pettersen is of course the person I must concentrate on as Faumuina's sentencing is yet to be completed and he has not completed his evidence. In relation to count 2, with respect, the defence for that was hopeless. The vehicle was clearly taken without the owner's consent. There was absolutely no evidence that the prisoner or Mr Pettersen knew the owner and the circumstances of the taking of the car and its abandonment under full surveillance were entirely consistent with a joint enterprise to steal that motor vehicle as defined under s 154A Crimes Act

201900. I note the vehicle was damaged at the time of taking or during the course of the time that Mr Pettersen was in control of it. I note that Mr Gogani did not drive that motor vehicle.

21My assessment of the objective criminality of this prisoner compared to that of Mr Pettersen is that it is exactly the same. This was conceded in submissions by learned counsel for the prisoner when that matter was briefly discussed. The two men spoke to each other as partners, acknowledged each other as equally involved and as having equal roles. Each man did different things from time to time. Some suggestion was made by the Crown in its submissions that I might regard Mr Gogani as directing Mr Pettersen to some extent, or doing more than Mr Pettersen, but ultimately when it is analysed the two men objectively were equals.

22I will deal with the issue of other aspects of the matter that arose from the submissions concerning a comparison between the prisoner and Mr Pettersen at a later time. The prisoner's criminal history is very similar to Mr Pettersen's although on analysis of Mr Pettersen's criminal history I would regard his criminal history as more serious than this prisoner.

23That having been said the prisoner, now aged thirty-two, has developed a very significant criminal history. At the age of twenty he was convicted of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon for which he received a term of imprisonment of two and one-half years and a non-parole period of twelve months. Approximately three years later, he was convicted of entering a building or land with a firearm or imitation firearm, for which he was sentenced to sixteen months imprisonment which was suspended and he was also convicted of aggravated breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence in company for which he received a two year term of imprisonment which was suspended.

24In 2005 he was called up in relation to each of these offences and the terms of imprisonment that were suspended were imposed with the nonparole period effectively being eighteen months. On release from custody, he was convicted of possessing housebreaking implements and breaking, entering and stealing for which he was sentenced to six months imprisonment. He was convicted of another offence of possessing housebreaking implements committed in 2004 for which he was also sentenced to six months imprisonment.

25On 10 December 2004 presumably whilst on bail in relation to some of the other offences I mentioned, he was charged with an offence of breaking, entering and stealing for which he was dealt with at the Local Court on 10 October 2005. He was sentenced to eight months imprisonment with a six month non-parole period. In May 2007 in the Sydney District Court he was convicted of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence but, as I understood the history, given a s9 bond. The Crown appealed against that sentence but the appeal was abandoned. Whilst on that bond he was charged with an offence of breaking, entering and stealing and in relation to that offence at the local court he was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment. 

26On 6 March 2009 at the Sydney District Court for offences which according to the criminal history he was charged with on 19 December 2007, whilst he was on the bond earlier given in the District Court, he was convicted of breaking, entering and stealing and sentenced to imprisonment with a nonparole period of one year ten months. Four months earlier he had been convicted of taking and driving a motor vehicle and driving a motor vehicle either recklessly or dangerously for which he received sentences of twelve and nine months imprisonment. The sentence imposed in the District Court was at least partially accumulative upon those sentences. 

27The prisoner, as I understand it, was on parole in relation to the sentences imposed in 2009 when he committed the current offences. He does have other offences on his record, convictions in relation to possession and selfadministration of prohibited drugs that he has been using since he was a teenager. 

28I have a report from the Probation and Parole Service, plus some reports concerning the prisoner's parole supervision. They were most helpful and particularly the report in relation to the parole supervision cast new light on some of the evidence given by the mother and cast light upon matters the subject of submission by his counsel. In that respect his mother had given evidence, and I will deal with her evidence shortly, that he had received a Naltrexone implant and this had a considerable impact upon him and an improvement upon his attitude and presentation. This was the centrepiece of submissions made to me that one of the distinctions I could draw between the prisoner and Mr Pettersen was that this prisoner, unlike Mr Pettersen, had good prospects, or some prospects, of rehabilitation. 

29When I read the report relating to his breach of parole however, prepared on 12 September 2011, I discovered firstly, that whilst the prisoner was involved in this conspiracy, he had in fact been breached in relation to his parole on 22 February 2011, although it would appear no action such as revocation of his parole occurred. He obviously was not returned to custody because the telephone intercepts show him active over the period of February and early March in relation to the conspiracy. The evidence contained within the Probation and Parole Service report for the benefit of the Parole Authority however, shows that he received the Naltrexone implant on 3 March 2011 when he was planning the very crime intended in count 1. 

30I note the report does reflect upon his encouraging presentation after the implant and I note the prisoner's comment to the parole officer that it was ""life changing experience"" and spoke ""convincingly of his commitment to ongoing study and personal training and his future"". However between 3 March and 21 March 2011 he was actively involved in the commission of the crime reflected in count 1 and on 20 March committed the crime particularised in count 2. It can be seen thus, that the implant, albeit it may have taken some time for it to reduce any craving for prohibited drugs, did not have any impact upon him so far as the commission of the two crimes that are set out in this indictment. 

31I note in that regard the mother's evidence about his Naltrexone implant was very vague as to the date upon which it occurred. In fact there was some conflicting evidence in relation to the matter. In fairness to the mother, I did not expect her to necessarily have the precise date of that implant, but the parole report makes it clear when it occurred. In relation to the Probation and Parole report for this court, it shows that his response to various forms of supervision has been considered as borderline to satisfactory. His response to supervision when his parole was revoked was considered ""superficial"". According to the custody record available to the court, when charged in relation to the current matters, his then current parole was revoked and he remained in custody until granted bail in February 2012 when he served the balance of sentence or otherwise was released to parole. It does not matter which, he was granted bail in relation to the current matter and remained on bail until he was charged with another matter in respect of which I have been provided the facts. He apparently went back into custody on 7 June 2012 in relation to that fresh matter. I will deal with that aspect of the case when I deal with his prospects of rehabilitation.

32In custody, he has incurred a number of institutional misconduct charges including failing to supply a urine test and on three occasions failing a proscribed urine test. He has been disciplined for fighting, intimidation et cetera. His behaviour has been described as poor, abusive and even noncompliant. The prisoner to the Probation and Parole Service described a close and supportive relationship with his family as is evidenced by his mother's evidence and the report sets out some detail of his background. having come to Australia from Iran but being rebellious and anti-social while his parents were preoccupied with their business. At the age of fourteen he complained to the Department of Community Services about the conduct of his parents and their strict discipline. He apparently was removed from the family home and lived in shelters and the like for a period of time which was a contributing factor to his use of illicit substances. Although he left school at fourteen and has endeavoured to obtain, firstly, his Higher School Certificate and then a Diploma in Real Estate. According to the Probation and Parole Service he has been unsuccessful in those endeavours. He has had some employment in various occupations, including labouring and what I would understand to be an apprentice refrigeration mechanic. But in recent years has largely worked in the family business on a part-time basis. He is in receipt of some form of government financial assistance prior to coming into custody, his family would welcome him back to the family home and into the business on his release.

33He gave a history, as I said earlier, of drug and alcohol abuse with a number of voluntary admissions in residential rehabilitation programs usually followed by relapses. He says that he has been a user of heroin, methylamphetamine and other drugs on a daily basis claiming to spend ""thousands of dollars"" on prohibited drugs. His drug dependency is described by the Probation and Parole Service as ""unresolved"". He refuses to take responsibility for his offending, he thinks that because they did not go ahead with the primary crime, he should not have been charged. He continued to claim to the Probation and Parole officer, quite preposterously, that he did not know the motor vehicle was stolen. He has shown, with respect to him by the material that has been obtained after the trial, by his conduct during the trial and his conduct before the trial, that he has absolutely no regret, contrition or anything similar, nor reflects any acknowledgement of guilt in any material way. 

34In summary, the Probation and Parole Service says that he has a long history of drug dependency with little success of addressing this up until the present time and the reporter says understatedly:

""of the concerns his failure to accept responsibility of (sic) his actions and the failure to recognise the seriousness of his actions. Given his ongoing drug dependency issues he may benefit from a long term residential rehabilitation program"".

35His counsel on his behalf produced a report from Dr Jeremy O'Dea, a psychiatrist. This sets out some family and developmental history and drug and alcohol history in the first person which is helpful, it sheds a little more light on what is set out in the Probation and Parole Service report but does not really tell the court much of significance in that regard. 

36With regard to the offences, he maintained his defiant attitude, he said, ""If they'd charged me under the right charge it may have been different."" I do not know what this is supposed to mean. But if the right charge was conspiracy to commit armed robbery, as I said, it may have resulted in a greater sentence than I can impose. The prisoner spoke about the positive effect upon him of the Naltrexone implant and also talked about his emotional instability having overdosed on one occasion on prescription drugs and other drugs. He has some difficulty sleeping in custody. He has tested positive to Hepatitis C but is not receiving any medication for that.

37According to the psychiatrist, ultimately, he did not present with any significant psychiatric disorder on presentation, no psychosis was evident, his cognitive function and his general presentation were within normal limits on what was described as a mini mental state examination. He did not demonstrate any specific or significant cognitive defects. The doctor's opinion was that he did not suffer from any major psychiatric illness but he did have a history of substance abuse disorder and also a history of vulnerable antisocial personality profile. He did not report any specific or significant traumatic experiences in his upbringing apart from the obvious problems of assimilating into a foreign culture. His criminal history and his conduct in this matter, if it is any indication, shows that he is well assimilated into the criminal culture of our society.

38The doctor states that he would need to address his drug and alcohol abuse in order to minimise his risk of committing further offences and he should receive drug and alcohol counselling and rehabilitation in custody and on his return to the community. It is in that context that I have considered s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and determined that there are, notwithstanding his past failures on parole and his past criminal history, reasons for concluding that there are special circumstances that warrant the adjustment of the non-parole period by relationship to the balance of the sentence particularly to give effect to the recommendations of the psychiatrist which will be available to the Parole Authority and which I have summarised. He will need some period of time to adjust to community living, the four year nine month non-parole period I fix commencing from yesterday is the most significant sentence that he will have and he will be then in his mid to latethirties and need professional assistance if he is prepared to take it up, not only to adjust to community living but to adjust to a lifestyle that does not involve mixing with and dealing with people like himself with lengthy criminal histories. 

39I note part of the history involves his overdose. This was a reaction his mother said to a loss of a girlfriend to another friend. There is nothing in the psychiatric evidence to warrant consideration of any of the issues that have been summarised in cases such as Hemsley or De La Rosa relating to mental illness or disability impacting upon the weight to be given to general deterrence and the like.

40So far as the prisoner's mother's evidence is concerned, she gave evidence about the implant to which I referred and spoke of the positive effect upon him. I have already commented upon that. However when he went back into custody in September 2011 he appears to have gone backwards and in fact the overdoes to which I referred must have occurred after he was released from custody. The mother pointed out, as was stressed in submissions, that one son has been a success in life but the prisoner seems to have been bedevilled by difficulties that have not affected other members of the family. The mother said that the prisoner had had a rough life over thirty years ago being forced to work in the family business from a young age. She said that the parents had always worked hard and they had not given proper time to direction, this is set out in the Probation and Parole Service report as I have noted. I see nothing in his background, however, that would explain his criminal history or, particularly, his current circumstances. Except insofar as it might have contributed to drug abuse. His mother talked about her physical problems and that she and her husband had difficulty diverting the prisoner from drugs. She said in cross-examination that the prisoner had been to some rehabilitation centres and received some counselling. I have taken that evidence into account.

41Learned counsel for the prisoner in his submissions noted, as I said earlier, that Mr Pettersen and the prisoner were objectively in the same situation. The primary thrust of the submission made, however, on behalf of Mr Gogani was that having regard to the evidence of the mother and the favourable reaction of the prisoner to the Naltrexone implant and the positive attitude of the prisoner after that, also reflected in the Probation and Parole Service report, and his good behaviour it is claimed up until his arrest in September in relation to this matter, the prisoner had good prospects of rehabilitation. which was a relevant mitigating factor and also relevant to the findings of special circumstances. 

42This submission was refined also to include a consideration of Wood J's observations in Henry v R, the guideline judgment relating to armed robbery and particularly the learned CJ at CL's observations at [273] of that judgment, concerning the relevance of drug dependency in sentencing an offender for armed robbery. 

43His motivation to commit crimes was raised on behalf of the prisoner, as being affected by his addiction to drugs. As I said, one of the problems with that submission was, as the evidence reveals, the prisoner's implant, even allowing some time for it to take effect, occurred in the course of his involvement in this conspiracy. Yet no withdrawal from the conspiracy occurred. The prisoner was obviously an enthusiastic proponent of fulfilling the criminal agreement until such time as he realised that they were under surveillance. Other submissions that were made by learned counsel for the prisoner were that the negative parts of the report by the Probation and Parole Service should not be given much weight, having regard to the accused's mother's evidence. It was submitted that the prisoner while he may do poorly in custody, did better whilst at large than Mr Pettersen. 

44It was submitted in relation to these matters that findings favourable to the prisoner would lead to a lower starting point than the sentence imposed on Mr Pettersen.

45The Court was urged to consider the full implications of the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment in relation to Mr Pettersen, which I have. This Court was taken to the issue of the five months and ten days, as I understand it, in custody between September and February 2012, which were said to be referable to this charge. 

46Of course, it was not solely referable to this charge because the prisoner's parole was revoked and he had to serve the balance of parole which ran up until shortly before he was granted bail. In this regard I am very mindful of what Simpson J said in the 2006 decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Callaghan, and particularly the need to be concerned in fixing a sentence where there is an offence committed while subject to parole, where parole is revoked, the Court is not to 'double dip' in that regard.

47It was a concern I have obviously also in relation to the sentence I imposed on Mr Pettersen. It was submitted to the Court that I should make a finding of special circumstances and I have indicated that I am prepared to do that.

48One other submission put on behalf of the prisoner was that there was evidence of Mr Gogani's background that might explain the way he turned out. It was submitted to the Court that there was nothing in the evidence of Mr Pettersen to explain the way he turned out. I have taken into account as I have said earlier the prisoner's mother's evidence, and I am mindful of some disadvantages the prisoner had as a teenager. But apart from the fact that it may have drawn the prisoner to lead a lifestyle that led to the use of prohibited drugs, there is very little evidence of the mother or in the background to explain the reasons that the prisoner should have such significant criminal proclivities.

49The Crown submitted that there were no mitigating factors of substance, that the prisoner had shown a continual pattern of using drugs and offending and really had no real prospects of rehabilitation notwithstanding the Naltrexone implant. 

50The Crown also provided very helpful written submissions citing the judgment in Pettersen [2013] NSWCCA 20, particularly at [10] and [942].

51The Crown made observations about the issue of the assessment of the prisoner's role in the conspiracy. I have taken all of those submissions into account, but again we come back to the fact that, having properly categorised Mr Pettersen's role on the occasion I sentenced him, according to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the categorisation of the prisoner's role on the basis of the evidence of the trial is not a particularly difficult matter, as was conceded by learned counsel for the prisoner.

52The Crown correctly pointed out that the totality of the telephone calls played at the trial showed that the prisoner had a managerial and decision making function similar to Mr Pettersen and they saw themselves as partners in the enterprise.

53The Crown referred to parity principles and the concept of 'equal justice' citing the decision of Green from the High Court at (2011) 244 CLR 462 and [28]. The Crown pointed out that Mr Pettersen had received a discount of twenty-five per cent for the utilitarian benefit of his pleas of guilty which this prisoner could not get. The Crown noted the prisoner's extensive history, as with Mr Pettersen's, and the aggravating circumstance of committing offences while subject to conditional liberty.

54The Crown submitted that there was a need for specific deterrence and general deterrence for the protection of the community. The prisoner had committed an offence with an intention for financial gain, which was planned. The commission of an offence for financial reward was not necessarily an inherent characteristic of an offence such as this, as I understood that submission. I do not agree with that. It is a very essential element in the factual sense, one would have thought most times, in an offence such as pleaded in count 1.

55Be that as it may, for the purposes of s 21A(2) the aggravating factors that arise for this prisoner are the same as for Mr Pettersen. When sentencing Mr Pettersen the aggravating factors included committing the offence whilst on conditional liberty, as is the case here, both men being on parole.

56As with Mr Pettersen, insofar as mitigating factors are concerned, I have taken into account that there was no loss or damage because it was in fact a conspiracy that was uncompleted. 

57Mr Pettersen received consideration of a plea of guilty as a mitigating factor although I acknowledged he received a discrete discount. I have made a conclusion in relation to Mr Pettersen that he was contrite, which this prisoner is not. I did not conclude that Mr Pettersen had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation, or that he was unlikely to re-offend. 

58In relation to the criminal history of the prisoner, as with Mr Pettersen, whilst I do not find it to be an aggravating factor as contemplated under s 21A(2), his criminal history does not entitle him to any particular leniency. It is also relevant to the assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation taken in context.

59As far as the mitigating factors are concerned for this prisoner, under s 21A(3), apart from the absence of any loss or damage given the circumstances of the plans of the prisoner and Mr Pettersen being thwarted, I note the prisoner is a person who does not have an insignificant criminal history as with Mr Pettersen. As to the prospects of rehabilitation and his likelihood of re-offending, which is intimately bound up with that matter, I have taken everything that could be said and has been said by his counsel in that respect into account. But, ultimately, when I consider all the evidence, the power of the particular submissions that were made is substantially diminished having regard to what I have pointed out about the implant, having regard to his past performance. The 'proof in the pudding' to which I referred.

60There is, however, one other matter that needs to be taken into account that did not occupy counsel for the prisoner, when he was making his submissions. 

61In relation to the prospects of rehabilitation of the prisoner I take into account that when the prisoner was given bail in February of 2012, in relation to this matter, on 8 May 2012 he committed an offence which was dealt with in the District Court earlier this year after the trial over which I presided.

62I have the statement of facts in relation to that matter and although the sentence imposed by the learned sentencing judge is not within the criminal history, according to the custody record the prisoner was sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a non-parole period of one year two months to date from 7 June 2012, expiring on 6 August 2013. That is three days ago.

63The crime to which he pleaded guilty was an offence that involved the prisoner and three other men going to the home of a person, entering the home of that person without his permission and seeking from that person details of the whereabouts of another man who owed the prisoner money, with threatening behaviour as it is particularised in the statement of facts.

64It is clear in relation to that offence, from the facts available to the sentencing judge, that the prisoner played a leading role in the commission of the offence. When the victim's mother who was in the house called out, 'I am calling the police', the prisoner in the facts is alleged to have said, 'Don't call the cops, you will be sorry.'

65When he was arrested in relation to this matter in June 2012 he again was bail refused and remained in custody until he came to trial before me. He pleaded guilty to the offence of enter dwelling with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely intimidation.

66The facts state that he intended to intimidate a person by his and the physical presence of other people, to recover moneys allegedly owed by a person to Mr Gogani.

67The facts of that matter reveal, notwithstanding the fact that he was on bail in relation to these matters, no indication on the part of the prisoner, whilst at large on bail, any attitude of reform, or to do anything other than to behave the way that he clearly has behaved over the last ten years. That is, committing crimes of various seriousness for his own ends. There was nothing altruistic or noble about his offending and he has absolutely no regret about it.

68I have taken into account his history of offending and his history of Probation and Parole supervision, the evidence of the psychiatrist, the prisoner's behaviour since his arrest in relation to this matter and I could not, on the totality of the evidence, notwithstanding the urgings of his counsel, conclude on balance that the prisoner has good or reasonable prospects of rehabilitation or that he is, not likely to re-offend in the future. 

69If the prisoner continues to behave the way he has continued up until the present time he will continue to be a danger to the community, not necessarily in the sense of a physical danger but a danger to the community's entitlement to have the protection of their property. The prisoner is a person who commits crimes for his own selfish purposes.

70I appreciate that part of the solution for the prisoner, if he wishes to undertake it, is to try and overcome his history of drug dependence. He also has to address his very strong anti-social criminal proclivities, which he obviously has no hesitation in engaging in, whether he is drug dependent or not.

71In sentencing the prisoner I have had regard to s 3A . This offence in context requires elements of general and personal deterrence and protection of the community from the offender. Part of the reasoning in the finding of special circumstances is in part to promote his rehabilitation.

72Ultimately, all things considered arising out of s 3A and s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the situation is this; that the starting point for Mr Pettersen was eight years imprisonment. Objectively, both offenders are equally liable.

73Mr Pettersen received a discount of twenty-five per cent for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty which this prisoner cannot get. Mr Pettersen was contrite. This prisoner was not contrite. The same aggravating factors arise in relation to matters relevant under s 21A(2). Ultimately, the same mitigating factors, other than contrition and the plea of guilty, arise in relation to this prisoner.

74If I was to distinguish between the two men, I would concede that whilst this prisoner's record does him no credit, Mr Pettersen's criminal history is a more serious criminal history, with more significant terms of imprisonment in the past, for more serious offences than this prisoner has committed in the past. But the distinction is minor.

75Ultimately, I have decided in relation to this matter that, with a starting point of eight years imprisonment, I should impose a term of imprisonment of seven years six months. The six months' discount upon the starting point for Mr Pettersen represents recognition, firstly, of three months of the time spent in custody after his arrest for which he served the balance of parole in the context of the principles discussed in Callaghan v The Queen I have also given the prisoner a three-month benefit in distinguishing him from Mr Pettersen having regard to their records.

76That having been said, the finding of contrition in Mr Pettersen's favour was a matter that could have properly negated that aspect of the matter. 

77There is no correct mathematical outcome in sentencing by and large. Makarian v The Queen made it very clear that a judge is required to take into account a large number of things, but ultimately I have concluded there should be some minor adjustment downwards for this prisoner to recognise what I have acknowledged in the judgment.

78Stand up please Mr Gogani. In relation to count 2 you are convicted and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment. That term of imprisonment dates from 7 August 2013, that is the date after the expiry of the current non-parole period, and will expire on 6 February 2015. 

79In relation to the offence in count 1 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of four years nine months and that will date from 7 August 2013 and expire on 6 May 2018. That is the earliest that you will be eligible for parole. 

80The balance of sentence as I calculate will be two years and nine months and that will expire on 6 February 2021. Whether you are released to parole or not will be a matter for the Parole Authority. Take a seat thank you. You may go with the officers.

		20 February 2014",2013-08-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706367,Environment Protection Authority v Terrace Earthmoving Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCCA 180,"Judgment

1BASTEN ACJ: The Environment Protection Authority commenced criminal proceedings against Terrace Earthmoving Pty Ltd and Geoffrey James Page, a director of the company. Each of the charges alleged conduct by the company in contravention of s 143(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW) (""the Act""), which prohibited transport of waste to a place that cannot lawfully be used as a waste facility for that waste. If the company contravened the provision, a director of the company is also taken to have contravened the provision: s 169(1). For present purposes, nothing turns on the particular defences available to a director because the primary judge held that the company had not contravened s 143. (Unless it is necessary to refer to the director, it is convenient use ""the respondent"" to refer to the company.)

2Terrace Earthmoving undertook demolition and excavation work on building sites and removed unwanted by-products of those activities. It also carried on road-building on private land and, for that purpose, used material removed from demolition sites to form the base of a road. The question was whether the material removed from the building site following demolition was ""waste"" whilst being transported to private land to be used as road-base. 

3Both the company and Mr Page were charged with conduct which extended over a period from 23 November 2005 until 1 March 2007. The Act was amended on 1 May 2006, significantly for present purposes, varying the definition of ""waste"". That circumstance led to separate charges being filed in respect of conduct from 23 November 2005 to 30 April 2006 and from 1 May 2006 to 1 March 2007.

4Each charge was laid by a summons filed on 11 August 2010 in the Land and Environment Court. The proceedings were conducted over two weeks in August 2010. On 21 September 2012 the trial judge, Craig J, delivered lengthy reasons, concluding that he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the material transported by the company in each period was ""waste"" within the meaning of s 143 of the Act: Environment Protection Authority v Terrace Earthmoving Pty Ltd & Page [2012] NSWLEC 216 at [243]. The charges were not formally dismissed, however, the Authority having indicated that it would invite the trial judge to submit questions of law for the consideration of this Court, pursuant to s 5AE of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). In this Court the case was heard with a companion case raising similar issues: see Shannongrove Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority [2013] NSWCCA 179.

5Given the basis upon which the charges were to be dismissed, the only available question of law was whether the trial judge erred in his construction of the term ""waste"" in s 143. However, rather than identifying a question in those terms, and no doubt at the instigation of the Authority, on 13 December 2012 the trial judge submitted nine questions for determination by this Court. The questions contained footnotes referring to paragraphs in the judgment which, for ease of reference, have been incorporated into the questions, as set out below.

1. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that in determining whether the substance was 'waste' within the meaning of section 143(4) of the POEO Act during the First Charge Period [at [183]] the factors relevant for consideration included:

(a) the nature of the substance; (at [184])
(b) whether there was an identified demand for that substance; [at [184]]
(c) circumstances in which the substance was obtained or removed from its source; [at [184]]
(d) whether the substance was being transported to a place at which it was intended to be used for the purpose for which demand for the substance has been shown; [at [184]]
(e) the period of time that elapsed or was expected to elapse after the substance was transported to the place of its intended use before it was put to that use; and [at [184]]
(f) whether the substance was stockpiled at the place to which it had been transported? [at [221]]

2. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that in determining whether the substance was 'waste' within the meaning of paragraph (b) of the definition in the Dictionary to the POEO Act during the Second Charge Period the determination made by me in relation to the definition of 'waste' in the First Charge Period remained apposite? [at [228]]

3. In determining whether the substance was 'waste' within the meaning of section 143(4) of the POEO Act during the First Charge Period should I have held that the only factors for consideration were:

(a) the nature of the substance; and
(b) whether the substance was 'unwanted' or 'surplus' in the hands of the owner or generator of that substance?

4. In determining whether the substance was 'waste' within the meaning of paragraph (b) of the definition in the Dictionary to POEO Act during the Second Charge Period should I have held that the only factors for consideration were:

(a) the nature of the substance; and
(b) whether the substance was 'discarded, rejected, unwanted, surplus or abandoned' in the hands of the owner or generator of that substance?

5. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that the 'transport' of waste within the meaning of section 143 of the POEO Act to a place did not include the deposition of that substance at the place? [at [158]]

6. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that the definition of 'waste' in the Dictionary to the POEO Act had no application during the First Charge Period? [at [170]]

7. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that the definition of 'waste' in paragraph (a) in the Dictionary to the POEO Act had no application during the Second Charge Period? [at [227]]

8. Was it open on the facts found by me to conclude that the qualification expressed in the words ""A substance is not precluded from being waste merely because it may be reprocessed, re-used or recycled"" in Section 143(4) of the POEO Act was a limited one and did not change the determination that the substance transported by the First Respondent be 'unwanted' or 'surplus' in order to qualify as 'waste'? [at [214]]

9. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that the Appellant had an onus to prove beyond reasonable doubt that lawful authority was required to use the Property as a waste facility for that waste, and only once that had been proved, did an onus shift to the First Respondent and the Second Respondent to establish that there was lawful authority for that purpose? [at [233] and [240]]

6Although the questions followed the order in which matters were addressed in the judgment, they need to be addressed by this Court by reference to the particular charges. Thus, questions 1, 3, 6 and 8 related to the first charge period; questions 2, 4 and 7 related to the second charge period, and questions 5 and 9 appear to relate to both. 

Statutory provisions - first period
7During the first period, the substantive offence was identified as follows:

143 Unlawful transporting of waste

(1) Offence

If a person transports waste to a place that cannot lawfully be used as a waste facility for that waste:

(a) the person, and
(b) if the person is not the owner of the waste, the owner,

are each guilty of an offence.
...

(3C) Defence-waste not deposited

It is a defence in any proceedings for an offence under this section if the defendant establishes that the waste transported by the defendant was not deposited by the defendant or any other person at the place to which it was transported.

(4) Definitions

In this section:
...
owner of waste includes, in relation to waste that has been transported, the person who was the owner of the waste immediately before it was transported.

waste includes any unwanted or surplus substance (whether solid, liquid or gaseous). A substance is not precluded from being waste merely because it may be reprocessed, re-used or recycled.

8The Dictionary also contained a definition of ""waste"" which commenced ""waste (unless specially defined) includes..."". The trial judge held that as s 143(4) provided its own definition for the purpose of that section, waste was ""specially defined"" for the purposes of the exclusion to the Dictionary definition: at [174]. The Dictionary definition therefore did not apply in respect of s 143(1). In reaching that conclusion, the trial judge noted that there were in fact only two places in the Act in which ""waste"" was given a definition separate from that in the Dictionary: one was s 143 and the other was s 115, in relevantly identical terms to s 143. If those were not examples of the term being ""specially defined"", the exclusion in the Dictionary definition had no function.

Statutory provisions - second period
9After 1 May 2006, the operative provision read as follows:

143 Unlawful transporting or depositing of waste

(1) Offence

If a person transports waste to a place that cannot lawfully be used as a waste facility for that waste, or causes or permits waste to be so transported:

(a) the person, and
(b) if the person is not the owner of the waste, the owner,

are each guilty of an offence.

10The italicized words were added to the earlier form of the section. The defence in subs (3C) did not change, but the definition of ""waste"" in sub-s (4) was removed. From 1 May 2006, the relevant definition was that appearing in the Dictionary, which was amended to delete the words ""unless specially defined"".

11The definition of ""waste"" in the Dictionary was also amended from 1 May 2006 so that what had been paragraph (d) (referring to substances prescribed by regulations), became paragraph (e) and a new paragraph (d) in the following terms was inserted; it then read:

waste includes:

(a) any substance (whether solid, liquid or gaseous) that is discharged, emitted or deposited in the environment in such volume, constituency or manner as to cause an alteration in the environment, or
(b) any discarded, rejected, unwanted, surplus or abandoned substance, or
(c) any otherwise discarded, rejected, unwanted, surplus or abandoned substance intended for sale or for recycling, reprocessing, recovery or purification by a separate operation from that which produced the substance, or
(d) any processed, recycled, re-used or recovered substance produced wholly or partly from waste that is applied to land, or used as fuel, but only in the circumstances prescribed by the regulations or
(e) any substance prescribed by the regulations to be waste.

A substance is not precluded from being waste for the purposes of this Act merely because it is or may be processed, re-used or recycled.

12The various differences between the applicable definitions in each period are outlined in Shannongrove and need not be repeated. In brief, that discussion concluded with the proposition that the term ""waste"", as defined in both periods, refers to substances which were unwanted by their owner, or surplus to the needs of the owner and that whilst they might cease to be waste at some point if processed, re-used or recycled, the fact that such a course may be undertaken after transportation would not prevent the substance being waste in the hands of the owner and hence at the point at which transportation commenced.

Factual background
13The questions of law submitted to this Court came in the form of a case stated, accompanied by a statement setting out what were described as the judge's ""findings of ultimate fact"". In fact, that section provided a descriptive background to the case, as dealt with in the judgment. It commenced by identifying the ""place"" to which the waste the subject of the charges was transported. This was a rural property at Williamtown on which the owners proposed to construct an internal access road, which will be referred to below as ""the Williamtown property"". Although the statement set out findings of fact as to why the owners wished to construct the road, none of that is relevant for present purposes.

14In relation to the respondent company, Terrace Earthmoving, the judge noted his finding that its business activities ""included earthmoving, land excavations, land clearing and building demolition"" and that it had ""also undertaken road construction"". The judge found that Terrace Earthmoving had a contract with the owners of the Williamtown property to build an internal access road, which work commenced late in November 2005 and continued until March 2007. Critically for present purposes, the trial judge stated at [8]:

""The fill material used for road construction was obtained from sites at which Terrace was carrying out demolition or excavation works. Demolition or excavated material was taken from those sites and transported to [the Williamtown property] in trucks belonging to Terrace. The material utilised generally comprised broken concrete, bricks, tiles, soil and rock.""

15Critical to the finding that the substances transported were not waste, the trial judge held at [205]:

""The fact that a dwelling was to be demolished or a site excavated did not have the consequence that all the material brought to ground as a result of demolition or material excavated to accommodate a new dwelling was, in either case, material that was unwanted or surplus at that site. I so conclude by reason of the deliberate process of separating materials so that those identified as being unwanted or surplus in the true and objective sense were set aside and taken to a landfill site. Those materials identified as serving a construction function for the purpose of the road or track to be upgraded on [the Williamtown property] were, having been so identified, set aside at their site of origin, loaded separately into trucks for transport, taken to [the Williamtown property] and within a short space of time placed on the road alignment and compacted as part of the road construction.""

16The trial judge made additional findings to the effect that while the material was not needed on the site from which it was removed, it was capable of being reused and had value for purposes such as that for which it was in fact used, namely road base: at [207]-[208].

Basis of decisions at trial
17In respect of the first charge, the trial judge found that the relevant definition of ""waste"" was that contained in s 143(4): see [7] above. The critical issue in respect of the first charge was the manner in which the trial judge construed that provision; in substance, he treated the wants or needs of the owner of the material immediately prior to transportation as not determinative of the proper characterisation of the substance, but as a factor to be taken into account together with the suitability of the material for re-use or recycling and the fact that, at the time of transportation, the material was intended by the carrier to be re-used. Having noted the language of s 143(4) and the English language dictionary definitions of the ordinary meaning of ""waste"", the trial judge stated:

""[178] As Terrace submitted, the determination as to whether a substance is 'unwanted' or 'surplus' is to be made on the basis that extends beyond the purview of a particular person or entity. An element of objectivity must be introduced in order to avoid an idiosyncratic and unintended result when seeking to apply the particular words or meaning to a given factual situation.

...

[181] Nothing contained in the definition found in s 143(4) suggests the identity of the person or entity whose opinion determines that particular material is 'unwanted' or 'surplus'. This fact, coupled with the ordinary meaning of 'waste', to the extent to which it uses expressions different from those included in the statutory definition, point to the need for an element of objectivity when determining that material is waste.""

18This approach led the trial judge to the following conclusion at [184]:

""Without intending to be exhaustive, the factors relevant for consideration are:

(i) the nature of the substance;
(ii) whether there is an identified demand for that substance;
(iii) circumstances in which the substance is obtained and removed from its source;
(iv) whether the substance is being transported to a place at which it is intended to be used for the purpose for which demand for the substance has been shown; and
(v) the period of time that elapses or is expected to elapse after the substance is transported to the place of its intended use before it is put to that use.""

19Later, in explaining why the material transported to the Williamtown property was not waste, the trial judge stated at [210]:

""The 'commonsense' approach to the application of the definition of 'waste' which I have identified, seems to me to be consistent with a purposive approach to the interpretation of the legislation as a whole. One of the expressed objects of the POEO Act, as expressed in s 3, is 'to assist in the achievements of the objectives of the Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Act 2001'. An object of the latter legislation, as expressed in s 3 of that Act, is to ensure that resource management options are considered in the context of 'resource recovery (including reuse, reprocessing, recycling and energy recovery)'. These legislative provisions support the need to focus upon a number of factors of the kind earlier identified when determining whether material is 'waste' rather than making the assessment wholly upon the position of the party or entity initially determining the material surplus to its requirements and therefore unwanted by it.""

20The trial judge dealt separately with the second sentence in the definition of ""waste"", stating at [214]:

""The last sentence in the definition of 'waste' found in s 143(4) has not been overlooked by me. It is the qualifying sentence to the definition, providing that a substance is not precluded from being waste 'merely because' it is capable of being 'reprocessed, re-used or recycled.' I regard the qualification so expressed as being a limited one. I take it to mean that the capacity of the material in question to be 'reprocessed, re-used or recycled' does not, of itself, determine that the material is not 'waste'. However, the qualifying sentence does not result in the ordinary meaning of 'waste' being ignored and, in particular, it does not change the determination that the material or substance be 'unwanted' or 'surplus' in order to qualify as 'waste'.""

21In relation to the second charge, the trial judge noted that the prosecutor had relied only upon paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Dictionary definition: at [224]. Although the respondent asserted the correctness of that proposition, it is doubtful whether the argument was so constrained. Thus, both parties and the trial judge gave careful attention to the reasoning of Pearlman J in Environment Protection Authority v HTT Huntley Heritage Pty Ltd [2003] NSWLEC 76; 125 LGERA 332, esp at [20]. The focus of that discussion was paragraph (c) of the definition: see judgment below at [215]-[220]. 

22Although the trial judge referred to the paragraphs in the definition as linked by ""the conjunctive 'or'"", he did not think paragraph (a) applicable and accordingly treated ""or"" as disjunctive. There can be no disagreement with that approach. Despite the somewhat expanded language at paragraph (b), the trial judge concluded that it was ""in substance, to the same effect as"" the definition in s 143(4). He concluded at [229]:

""Further, I do not consider that the additional descriptor of a substance as one that has been 'discarded', 'rejected' or 'abandoned' detract from the argument. In the ordinary use of language, it could not be said that the material[s] which I have determined were transported by Terrace were, at any point in time, either 'rejected' or 'abandoned'. As to whether those materials were 'discarded', they were in a sense 'cast aside' by the owner of the land on which they were initially located but this acknowledgement does no more than enliven the enquiry earlier addressed. That is, whether in the context of any inclusive definition of 'waste', the motive of the proprietor seeking to cast aside the material is the sole factor in determining that the material is waste. For the same reasons earlier articulated, the entire factual matrix requires consideration in order to address the definition and in so doing no different conclusion is reached by me from that earlier expressed when determining that the material was not waste.""

Relevant definition - first period
23Although the written submissions filed for the Authority asserted that the trial judge erred in concluding that the relevant definition in the first period was that found in s 143(4), no substantive argument was presented in support of that assertion and it should be rejected. The relevant definition of ""waste"" for the purposes of s 143(1), prior to 1 May 2006, was that contained in s 143(4). The trial judge was correct in that respect and question 6 should be answered affirmatively.

24Questions 1 and 3 were formulated by reference to the factors relevant to determining whether a particular substance was ""waste"" for the purposes of s 143(4); question 8 asked whether the second sentence in the definition of ""waste"" in s 143(4) had little relevance in the circumstances of the case. These questions do not directly articulate the question of law which needs to be determined and cannot readily be answered in the terms in which they are asked. In particular, to separate one part of the definition from the rest is to invite error. In many cases, and particularly in the present case, the whole statutory context is critical to understanding the language used. 

25Broadly speaking, the approach adopted by the trial judge was erroneous because it focused upon an objective assessment of whether the material transported was capable of being used for a specific purpose. The correct approach is to consider whether the owner of the material at the time transportation commenced had a continuing use for the material. If the owner did not, the material was waste, at least until it was applied to a new use: see Shannongrove at [29] and [34]-[38].

26In ordinary parlance, waste refers to unwanted by-products of a process and to an object (or substance) which the owner had, but no longer has, a use for and discards or abandons. In respect of the first category, being unwanted by-products of a process, the question is not whether they are ""capable"" of being used for some other purpose, nor whether there is a ""market"" for such material. Similarly, in relation to items for which the owner had, but no longer has, a use, the question is not whether some other person might conceivably want the item. Thus, in ordinary parlance, there is a clear distinction between a used car which is provided as a trade-in on a new vehicle or which is advertised for sale, and a vehicle which is abandoned by the owner. The last example, in contradistinction to the first two, is aptly described as ""waste"", even though a salvage business might be able to strip the vehicle for parts or sell it as scrap metal.

27The words ""unwanted"" and ""surplus"" require reference to the state of mind of some person. The concepts do not turn on any objective characteristic of the substance, although, as a matter of evidence, it may more readily be inferred that some substances are wanted than others. The relevant individual could be one of three people:- (a) the owner immediately prior to transportation; (b) the person carrying out the transportation, or (c) the owner of the property to which the substance is transported: Shannongrove at [12].

28The ordinary reading of the provision is that the relevant individual is the ""owner"" when transportation was arranged. That reading is confirmed by the fact that it is not only the person who transports the substance, but also the person who is the owner of the substance to be transported, and (after 1 May 2006) causes or permits it to be transported, who is guilty of an offence: Shannongrove at [29]. As explained further in Shannongrove, the fact that the substance was ""wanted"" by the carrier, in the sense that it was part of its business to transport such material, cannot render it other than waste. If that were not correct, there would be virtually no case in which an offence would be committed under s 143(1). Similarly, if it were decisive (or even relevant) that the material was wanted by the owner or controller of the place to which it was taken, the apparent purpose of the provision would likewise be subverted: Shannongrove at [36]-[38].

29The respondent in the present case sought to achieve a different result by reliance on two circumstances. The first was that the product of demolition or excavation which was being transported was required by the carrier (and the owner of the place to which it was taken, if that were relevant) for a specific purpose, which constituted part of the business of the carrier, namely the construction of the internal access road at the Williamtown property. Secondly, the respondent relied upon the fact that it sorted the material on the site of the original owner into that which was to be re-used as road base and that which was not. The latter (which was not the subject of the present charges) was conceded to be ""waste"", while the former was said not to satisfy the statutory definition of ""waste"".

30The fact that some waste is capable of being (re)processed, re-used or recycled suggests that at some point in time it may no longer be waste. It is necessary to determine when unwanted or surplus substances change their character from waste to non-waste. An indication as to when that may occur is to be found in the language of the offence-creating provision. Thus, it is an essential element of the offence that the waste is transported to a place which ""cannot lawfully be used as a waste facility for that waste"". Section 5 of the Act, read with Schedule 1, identifies a range of activities which require a licence issued by the Authority, authorising the activity to be carried on at specific premises. Throughout both periods (although it has since been amended), Part 1 of Schedule 1 identified ""premises-based"" activities. Various forms of ""waste facilities"" were included. More generally, the term ""waste facility"" is defined in the Dictionary to the Act to mean ""any premises used for the storage, treatment, processing, sorting or disposal of waste (except as provided by the regulations)"". (Before 1 May 2006, it referred to ""reprocessing"" rather than ""processing"".)

31Seen in this statutory context, the statement in the definition of ""waste"" (in s 143(4)) that ""[a] substance is not precluded from being waste merely because it may be reprocessed, re-used or recycled"" may be seen to be central to the characterization of a substance. Thus, s 143(1) prohibits transport of waste to a place other than a relevant ""waste facility"", a ""waste facility"" being any premises where such waste may lawfully be stored, treated, reprocessed, sorted or disposed of. The fact that a substance is being taken to a place where it will be re-used or recycled does not affect its characterization as ""waste"".

32The section thus promotes the re-use and recycling of waste - see s 3(d)(iii) - and, to the extent that waste material may be harmful, its processing or elimination: s 3(d)(ii) and (iia). Recognition of these purposes assists in determining whether, and if so when, that which is waste in the hands of the former owner ceases to be waste. In the case of old newspapers, put out on the street for recycling, their mere collection by a contractor will not prevent them being waste, nor permit the contractor to transport them to some place other than a waste facility licensed to recycle paper waste. In the present case, that the material transported was unwanted by the original owners, appears to have been accepted: the respondent was employed by the owners to remove the material. 

33The fact that the material might have resulted from activities undertaken by the respondent did not change that character, nor did the mere fact that the respondent sorted them on site. There is a difference between reprocessing, re-use or recycling, prior to transportation and merely identifying material which is capable of being reprocessed, re-used or recycled. The latter step merely identifies it as material (or a substance) which is capable of such re-use etc: it then falls within the second sentence of the definition of ""waste"". The steps taken in the present case were not sufficient to prevent it being waste at the time of transportation. ""Sorting"" the materials to set apart those which were to be re-used at a another place did not itself constitute that use, anymore than the separation by a residential landowner of materials into different forms of recycling for collection would have that effect.

34The owners of the property to which the materials were transported had a use for them, namely in the construction of a roadway over swampy land. However, the fact that they had a use for the material when it reached their property did not mean that the material ceased to be waste at some point before it reached their property. Neither did the fact that the respondent had been contracted to construct the roadway affect the characterisation of the material whilst in transit.

Did transport include deposit?
35The trial judge held that the offence was completed by transportation to a ""place"" which satisfied the statutory criterion of not being licensed as a relevant waste facility. The offence was completed when the vehicle arrived at the place: it was not an essential element of the offence that the material be deposited, for the offence to be complete: at [158] and [163]. 

36In Shannongrove, it was the offender who sought to argue that deposit was necessary, in order to avail itself of the intention or state of mind of the new owner. In the present case it was the Authority which sought to argue that deposit constituted part of the offence, for the ostensible purpose of engaging s 241 of the Act which required the Court, in assessing the penalty, to take into account ""the extent of the harm caused or likely to be caused to the environment by the commission of the offence"": s 241(1)(a). It was no doubt for that reason that the trial judge placed some emphasis on the existence of a separate offence of allowing land to be used as a waste facility when that is not a lawful use: s 144(1). However, that offence is committed by the owner or occupier of the land, who may not (and probably would not in the usual case) be the carrier. In any event, the possibility of overlap between two offences is a flimsy basis for construing the essential elements of each offence, in the absence of any indication that the offences were intended to be mutually exclusive in their operation.

37The other relevant consideration lies in the defence in s 143(3C), namely that the offence is not committed if the waste transported by the defendant was not deposited at the place to which it was transported. 

38It is, of course, possible that particular conduct be an essential element of an offence, but one which is presumed to be satisfied unless the defendant proves otherwise. However, the language of s 143 is not in those terms. The fact that non-deposit is described as a defence, at least in circumstances where the ordinary meaning of ""transport"" does not include depositing the load, speaks strongly against the proposition that depositing is an element of the offence under s 143. The trial judge was correct to conclude that it was not.

Meaning of ""waste"" - second period
39The variations in the definition of ""waste"" which occurred between the first and second periods have been adverted to above and are more fully discussed in Shannongrove. Generally speaking, the changes expanded or clarified, but did not restrict, the scope of the definition. Accordingly, if the elements of the first charge were made out, there being no change in the nature of the conduct of the respondent, it follows that the second charge must also be made out. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to address the specific questions raised. 

Scope of definition after amendment
40In relation to question 2, the trial judge held at [228] that paragraph (b) of the definition in the Dictionary was ""to the same effect"" as the expressions ""unwanted"" and ""surplus"" in s 143(4). 

41On the basis that the owner of the land on which the demolition or excavation took place did not want the material which was transported to the Williamtown property, it is no doubt true to say that the addition of the epithets ""discarded, rejected ... or abandoned"" added nothing of relevance. On the other hand, the formulation of the question in these terms, by abstracting two terms from the definition and, further, disregarding entirely the second sentence of the definition, is erroneous. The error is significant because the second sentence of the definition in s 143(4) is present in the Dictionary definition, though it does not form part of paragraph (b) alone, but rather affects the whole of the definition. 

42Importantly, there was also a variation in its language. Thus, the second sentence in s 143(4) stated:

""A substance is not precluded from being waste merely because it may be reprocessed, re-used or recycled.""

In the Dictionary definition, after the amendments, the equivalent sentence read:

""A substance is not precluded from being waste for the purposes of this Act merely because it is or may be processed, recycled, re-used or recovered."" (The differences from s 143(4) are italicized.)

43The insertion of the word ""is"" was probably referable to the inclusion of a new paragraph (d), in the following terms:

""(d) Any processed, recycled, re-used or recovered substance produced wholly or partly from waste that is applied to land, or used as fuel, but only in the circumstances prescribed by the regulations....""

This addition is significant: it gives force to the conclusion that where waste has been processed, recycled, re-used or recovered, it will cease to be waste, except in prescribed circumstances. That is consistent with the preferred reading of the second sentence of s 143(4), namely that the capacity of a substance to be reprocessed etc is not relevant but, by inference, the fact of reprocessing etc is significant and generally terminates the characterisation of the substance as waste. 

44The point may be taken a step further: even if paragraph (b) was relied upon as the basis of the prosecution, that did not mean that, in construing the terms of that paragraph, consideration was not to be given to the surrounding elements of the definition. In particular, it would have been appropriate to have regard to paragraph (c) and to the final sentence. According to that element of the definition, a substance which is discarded etc, but is intended for sale or recycling etc, is nevertheless waste. The construction set out above accepted that the possibility of such an intention in a third party did not prevent material being waste: paragraph (c) suggests that such an intention held by the original owner may also not preclude the material being waste, although arguably that merely clarified the original meaning. 

45Little attention was given to the operation of paragraph (c) in the present case (other than in the discussion of the reasoning in Huntley) and therefore no firm conclusion as to its scope and operation is called for. It is sufficient to note that the proposed understanding is consistent with the preferred construction of the definition accepted above, namely that where the material is unwanted in the hands of the original owner, it is waste and will remain waste until processed, recycled, re-used or recovered. Because paragraph (c) was ostensibly treated as irrelevant, a question not addressed below was the concept of ""recovery"". On one view it was a process involving a ""separate operation"", as referred to in paragraph (c). Whether it could be relied on by the respondent in this case was not raised by the questions asked.

46Because the dissection of the elements of waste which is implicit in question 2 is erroneous, it is inappropriate to answer the question in its terms.

Operation of paragraph (a) of the definition
47For reasons explained in Shannongrove, one reason why it may have been thought appropriate to have a special definition of ""waste"" in s 143 was that paragraph (a) of the definition in the Dictionary was seen not to be readily applicable to an offence under s 143. That is because paragraph (a) refers to a substance which is ""discharged, emitted or deposited in the environment"" so as to cause an alteration in the environment. If one took a different view of the submission that the depositing of the substance was an essential element of the offence under s 143, paragraph (a) might be relevant. However, on the assumption that transportation does not include depositing, it is reasonable to conclude that paragraph (a) has no material relevance to the offences created by s 143. An affirmative answer should be given to question 7.

Onus of proof - characterizing the ""place""
48It follows from the matters set out above that the conclusions reached by the trial judge as to the construction of the statute were, in material respects, erroneous. It remains to consider whether the Court should answer question 9 and what order the Court should make.

49Question 9 had two limbs: the first was whether the prosecutor had to prove that lawful authority was required to use the place to which the substance was being transported ""as a waste facility for that waste"". The second limb asked whether, once the prosecutor had established the need for lawful authority, the onus shifted to the defendant to establish that there was a lawful authority for that purpose.

50The respondents correctly noted that, although the trial judge did make findings in respect of these issues, they were not material to his conclusions. The respondents' primary position was that it was inappropriate to answer the question. In the alternative, the respondents submits that the approach of the trial judge should be upheld. 

51The issue arises in this way: the offence involves transporting waste ""to a place that cannot lawfully be used as a waste facility for that waste"": s 143(1). However, s 143(2) is in the following terms:

(2) Proof of lawfulness

In any proceedings for an offence under this section the defendant bears the onus of proving that the place to which the waste was transported can lawfully be used as a waste facility for that waste.

52The trial judge dealt with the matter at [237]:

""Implicit in subsection (1) is that some lawful authority is required in order to use the place to which waste is transported as a waste facility for that waste. No injustice is done to the language or purpose if the onus is cast upon the prosecutor to establish that lawful authority is required to use the place in that manner. Once that onus has been discharged, effect is given to subsection (2) by shifting the onus to the defendant to establish that any or all requisite authorities were operative at the time at which waste was transported to that place.""

53Approximately one-third of the appellant's written submissions were directed to this issue. The appellant alleged that the ""two limb test posited by the defendant - and accepted by his Honour - is, with respect, nonsensical"". The appellant also raised an issue, not discussed by the trial judge, as to whether s 417 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) dealing with the proof of authority or excuse in respect of ""a particular act or having a specified article or thing in possession"", applies to s 143(1). If it does, s 143(2) might be thought otiose. On the other hand, the appellant contended that s 417A of the Crimes Act, dealing with exceptions, excuses and qualifications to an offence, does not apply to s 143(1). That might also raise significant questions. 

54As more fully discussed in Shannongrove, the provisions defining what is and what is not a waste facility (in Schedule 1, Part 1) themselves give rise to questions of fact. There is, thus, a real issue as to whether the prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt that the place to which the waste was taken fell within the description of a ""waste facility"". That question might be thought readily capable of discrete treatment from the question of whether an authority or licence existed to use the premises in question for that purpose.

55There are other possible complications which were not addressed, either by the trial judge or in submissions in this Court. For example, the definition of ""waste facilities"" in Schedule 1 referred to areas, the nature of the waste and the nature of the facility. Some, such as landfill and application sites, have geographic definitions subject to exceptions. That would give rise to a question as to the party bearing the burden of negativing or establishing the exception. (The term ""landfill or application site"" had its own definition in Schedule 1, Part 3.)

56Although the result reached by the trial judge is by no means ""nonsensical"", the somewhat brief discussion of an issue which did not require determination, in circumstances involving layers of complexity, suggests that the question should not be answered in the present case.

Orders
57On the basis of the reasons set out above it is appropriate to provide answers to questions 1-8, although some variation is required to their terms, in order to deal with them as questions of law.

58It was apparently accepted at [229], although without making a precise finding, that the substances transported to the Williamtown property were unwanted or surplus in the hands of the owners of the land from which they were taken. It is difficult to envisage, on the basis of the evidence discussed by the trial judge, that any other finding could be made, but it is appropriate that the matter be returned to the Land and Environment Court for that step to be taken.

59Secondly, if such a finding were made in respect of the original owner of the material, there is a further finding required, namely that the materials were not processed, re-used or recycled prior to transportation in a manner which caused them to cease to be ""waste"". The fact that they were ""sorted"" into materials which were to be re-used at a particular place would not itself constitute that use. Accordingly, on the evidence discussed in the judgment, it would appear unlikely that any other conclusion could be reached than that the material was ""waste"" when it was transported to the Williamtown property. However, because the trial judge approached the matter on an erroneous basis, there was no finding in those terms and it is appropriate that the trial judge deal with the factual issue. 

60Thirdly, having determined that the material was not waste, no findings were required with respect to whether the Williamtown property was a place which could not lawfully be used as a waste facility for that waste: see [243]. On the assumption that the material transported is found to be ""waste"", further findings in relation as to the nature of the place to which it was transported will also be required. 

61As the matter will have to be returned to the Land and Environment Court for final orders in accordance with the answers given by this Court to the questions referred to it, it is inappropriate for this Court to comment further on the evidence before the Land and Environment Court. It should, however, be noted that much of the extensive evidence adduced was irrelevant to the proper consideration of the charges.

62Although it is clear for the foregoing reasons that the trial judge approached the matters on an erroneous basis in point of law, only some of the questions raised by the appellant have been determined in accordance with the answers proposed by it and question 9, to which significant attention was directed, has not been answered. The appellant did not seek an order for costs, although the respondent did. In the circumstances it is not appropriate to order that either party pay costs of the other.

63The questions should be answered and orders made in the following terms:

(1) Question:
6. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that the definition of 'waste' in the Dictionary to the POEO Act had no application during the First Charge Period? 
Answer:
On the proper construction of the Act, the definition of ""waste"" in the Dictionary had no application to an offence under s 143(1) prior to 1 May 2006, whilst ""waste"" was specially defined in s 143(4).

(2) Question:
5. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that the 'transport' of waste within the meaning of section 143 of the POEO Act to a place did not include the deposition of that substance at the place? 
Answer:
On the proper construction of the Act, ""transport"" of waste for the purposes of s 143(1) did not include depositing the substance at the place to which it was transported.

(3) Questions:
1. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that in determining whether the substance was 'waste' within the meaning of section 143(4) of the POEO Act during the First Charge Period the factors relevant for consideration included:
(a) the nature of the substance; 
(b) whether there was an identified demand for that substance; 
(c) circumstances in which the substance was obtained or removed from its source; 
(d) whether the substance was being transported to a place at which it was intended to be used for the purpose for which demand for the substance has been shown; 
(e) the period of time that elapsed or was expected to elapse after the substance was transported to the place of its intended use before it was put to that use; and 
(f) whether the substance was stockpiled at the place to which it had been transported? 

3. In determining whether the substance was 'waste' within the meaning of section 143(4) of the POEO Act during the First Charge Period should I have held that the only factors for consideration were:
(a) the nature of the substance; and
(b) whether the substance was 'unwanted' or 'surplus' in the hands of the owner or generator of that substance?

8. Was it open on the facts found by me to conclude that the qualification expressed in the words ""A substance is not precluded from being waste merely because it may be reprocessed, re-used or recycled"" in Section 143(4) of the POEO Act was a limited one and did not change the determination that the substance transported by the First Respondent be 'unwanted' or 'surplus' in order to qualify as 'waste'? 
Answer:
On the proper construction of the Act, whether a substance was ""waste"" for the purposes of s 143(4) required the court to consider whether the substance being transported was unwanted or surplus by and to the owner of the waste immediately before it was transported. That question of fact was to be determined without reference to whether, because of its nature, the substance might be reprocessed, re-used or recycled. The other factors referred to in questions 1 and 3 were irrelevant except to the extent that their consideration might provide evidence of the state of mind of the owner of the land on which the substance existed immediately prior to transportation.

(4) Question:
7. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that the definition of 'waste' in paragraph (a) in the Dictionary to the POEO Act had no application during the Second Charge Period? 
Answer:
On the proper construction of paragraph (a) in the definition of ""waste"" in the Dictionary to the Act, as in force on and from 1 May 2006, a substance is not discharged, emitted or deposited in the environment by transporting it to a place for the purposes of s 143(1) of the Act.

(5) Questions: 
2. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that in determining whether the substance was 'waste' within the meaning of paragraph (b) of the definition in the Dictionary to the POEO Act during the Second Charge Period the determination made by me in relation to the definition of 'waste' in the First Charge Period remained apposite? 

4. In determining whether the substance was 'waste' within the meaning of paragraph (b) of the definition in the Dictionary to POEO Act during the Second Charge Period should I have held that the only factors for consideration were:

(a) the nature of the substance; and
(b) whether the substance was 'discarded, rejected, unwanted, surplus or abandoned' in the hands of the owner or generator of that substance?
Answer:
The meaning of the term ""waste"", as defined in the Dictionary to the Act on and from 1 May 2006, was to be addressed having regard to the whole of the definition and the context in which the word appeared in s 143(1). 

In undertaking that exercise, 
(a) paragraph (a) provided little or no assistance in defining the term for the purposes of s 143(1);
(b) the words ""discarded"", ""rejected"" and ""abandoned"", describe characteristics of a substance by reference to an action of the owner which may assist in determining whether the substance was ""unwanted"" or ""surplus"" in the hands of the owner;
(c) a substance will remain waste even though it is intended to be sold, recycled, processed, recovered or purified by a separate operation from that which produced the substance and will remain waste until one of those steps is taken.

(6) Question:
9. Was it open on the facts found by me to hold that the Appellant had an onus to prove beyond reasonable doubt that lawful authority was required to use the Property as a waste facility for that waste, and only once that had been proved, did an onus shift to the First Respondent and the Second Respondent to establish that there was lawful authority for that purpose? 
Answer:
Inappropriate to be answered.

(7) Order that the proceedings be returned to the Land and Environment Court, for final orders to be made in accordance with the answers given to the questions of law as determined by this Court.

(8) No order as to the costs of the proceedings in this Court.

64HALL J: I agree with Basten ACJ.

65BARR AJ: I agree with Basten ACJ.

		20 March 2014",2013-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706368,Shannongrove Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority [2013] NSWCCA 179,"Judgment

1BASTEN ACJ: This case and an accompanying matter, Environment Protection Authority v Terrace Earthmoving Pty Ltd, concern the meaning of ""waste"" in the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW). Each defendant was charged with transporting waste to a place that cannot lawfully be used as a waste facility for that waste, contrary to s 143(1) of the Act. Shannongrove Pty Ltd was convicted but Terrace Earthmoving Pty Ltd was acquitted. Shannongrove has appealed pursuant to ss 5AB and 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). It will be necessary to identify the relevant statutory provisions, the principles of statutory construction and the correct approach to the application of those principles to the Act. With those matters in mind, the legislation can be applied to the facts. Before undertaking that process, however, it is convenient to note briefly the circumstances to which the relevant construction is to be applied.

Factual background
2Shannongrove contracted with the operator of a waste facility at Eastern Creek to take a form of sludge referred to as ""liquid by-product"" which resulted from the treatment of organic waste. The facility was known as the ""Urban Resources Reduction Recovery and Recycling Facility"" or, more colloquially, the ""UR-3R Facility"". Shannongrove collected the liquid by-product from Eastern Creek and transported it to a farm on Northern Road, Bringelly on which the owner ran dairy cattle. The liquid was injected into the soil as a form of fertiliser. However, the farm was not a ""waste facility"" within the meaning of that term in the Act and was not licensed to receive such waste. The correctness of the conviction therefore depended upon whether liquid by-product or sludge was properly characterised as ""waste"" for the purposes of s 143(1). Looked at from the perspective of the operator of the UR-3R Facility, it was waste, in the sense that it was an unwanted by-product of the processing undertaken at the facility. Looked at from the perspective of the dairy farmer, it provided a means of improving his pastures.

3The charges related to a course of conduct which was divided into two periods. The period the subject of the first charge ran from ""about 28 January 2005"" until 28 April 2006; the period the subject of the second charge from ""about 1 May 2006"" until 5 July 2006. 1 May 2006 was the commencement date of significant changes in the Act. The nature of the changes will be discussed below in considering the separate charges, but they involved, primarily, significant increases in the maximum penalties (in the case of a corporation, increasing from $250,000 to $1 million) and changes in the definition of ""waste"".

4There was a dispute at trial as to the precise amount of liquid transported and its proper designation. The trial judge accepted that almost 5,000 tonnes of liquid transported over the two periods constituted ""excess process water"", some 540 tonnes was ""digester liquid"" and the small remainder other forms of waste water, amounting in total to approximately 5,660 tonnes: Environment Protection Authority v Shannongrove Pty Ltd [2010] NSWLEC 162; 176 LGERA 31 at [111]. As a tanker load constituted between 25 and 28 tonnes of liquid, or approximately 25,000-28,000 litres, about 200 loads were transported during the relevant periods: at [43]. Nothing turns on the nature of the loads for present purposes.

The statutory scheme 
5Prior to 1 May 2006, s 143(1) of the Act read as follows:

143 Unlawful transporting of waste

(1) Offence

If a person transports waste to a place that cannot lawfully be used as a waste facility for that waste:

(a) the person, and
(b) if the person is not the owner of the waste, the owner,

are each guilty of an offence.
...

(3C) Defence-waste not deposited

It is a defence in any proceedings for an offence under this section if the defendant establishes that the waste transported by the defendant was not deposited by the defendant or any other person at the place to which it was transported.

(4) Definitions

In this section:

...

owner of waste includes, in relation to waste that has been transported, the person who was the owner of the waste immediately before it was transported.

waste includes any unwanted or surplus substance (whether solid, liquid or gaseous). A substance is not precluded from being waste merely because it may be reprocessed, re-used or recycled.

6The Dictionary to the Act, prior to 1 May 2006, also had a definition of waste, which was in the following terms:

waste (unless specially defined) includes:

(a) any substance (whether solid, liquid or gaseous) that is discharged, emitted or deposited in the environment in such volume, constituency or manner as to cause an alteration in the environment, or
(b) any discarded, rejected, unwanted, surplus or abandoned substance, or
(c) any otherwise discarded, rejected, unwanted, surplus or abandoned substance intended for sale or for recycling, reprocessing, recovery or purification by a separate operation from that which produced the substance, or
(d) any substance prescribed by the regulations to be waste for the purposes of this Act.

A substance is not precluded from being waste for the purposes of this Act merely because it can be reprocessed, re-used or recycled.

7The trial judge held, for reasons which should be accepted, that the term ""waste"" was ""specially defined"" in s 143(4), prior to 1 May 2006 and, accordingly, the definition in the Dictionary did not apply. The relevant definition of ""waste"" for the purposes of the first charge was that found in s 143(4).

8After 1 May 2006, the operative provision read as follows:

143 Unlawful transporting or depositing of waste

(1) Offence

If a person transports waste to a place that cannot lawfully be used as a waste facility for that waste, or causes or permits waste to be so transported:

(a) the person, and
(b) if the person is not the owner of the waste, the owner,

are each guilty of an offence.

9The defence in subs (3C) did not change, but the definition of ""waste"" in sub-s (4) was removed. From 1 May 2006, the relevant definition was that appearing in the Dictionary, which was amended to delete the words ""unless specially defined"".

10The definition of ""waste"" in the Dictionary was also amended from 1 May 2006 so that what had been paragraph (d) (referring to substances prescribed by regulations), became paragraph (e) and a new paragraph (d) in the following terms was inserted:

(d) any processed, recycled, re-used or recovered substance produced wholly or partly from waste that is applied to land, or used as fuel, but only in the circumstances prescribed by the regulations....

Principles of statutory interpretation 
11In considering the relevant principles of statutory interpretation, it is convenient to start by noting that both definitions purported to be inclusive rather than exhaustive. That raises a question as to whether the intention is that ""waste"" has an ordinary meaning, of which the specified characteristics are examples, or to which they are extensions.

12That which is included is ""any unwanted or surplus substance"". That language invites the questions ""unwanted by whom"" or ""surplus to whose wants or needs""? Is the relevant perspective that of the owner of the substance prior to transportation, the transporter, or the person (if any) with whom the substance is to be deposited? Is the point of reference the same in all cases? If the substance is wanted or needed by any person, is it waste? If not wanted or needed by the owner prior to transport, but wanted or needed by the person to whom it is to be transported, does the substance change its character at some point in time, and if so, when?

13Turning to the second sentence of the definition in s 143(4), there are further elements of uncertainty. Does that sentence refer to the capacity of the substance to be reprocessed, re-used or recycled or to a factual possibility that it will be reprocessed, re-used or recycled? Secondly, if it is either capable or likely to be reprocessed etc, it apparently may not be ""waste"", but in what circumstances will it yet be waste? Further, should one infer that if the substance is in fact reprocessed, re-used or recycled, it will, at least at that time, cease to be waste?

14In the course of submissions, the Court was invited to look to various materials beyond the terms of s 143 in order to answer these questions, and in particular:

(a) other provisions of the Act and especially the objectives identified in s 3;
(b) earlier legislation dealing with similar issues;
(c) case law;
(d) general principles of statutory construction;
(e) authorities dealing with a European directive, and
(f) definitions from English language dictionaries.

However, it was not suggested that the term had any special meaning in trade, industry, commerce or environmental protection.

15There is no doubt that the language of the definitions must be construed coherently with other provisions of the Act and by reference to its objects, in accordance with general principles of statutory construction. This exercise will involve the need to have regard to variations in terminology, both within the Act at a particular time and changes made over time. The development of the current definitions from earlier legislation and the use of English language dictionary definitions are of limited value in this context. Similarly, any case law must be addressed with particular reference to the provision being considered. Further, the European Directive, to which attention was drawn by counsel for the Authority, was one in which ""waste"" was defined as ""any substance or object ... which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard."" This definition focused upon the ""holder"" of the material and the holder's intention and action. The authorities applying that definition reach a conclusion which favours that sought by the Authority in the present case, but by reference to language which does not assist in construing the New South Wales Act.

16The objects of the Act relevantly state:

3 Objects of Act

The objects of this Act are as follows:

(a) to protect, restore and enhance the quality of the environment in New South Wales, having regard to the need to maintain ecologically sustainable development,
...
(d) to reduce risks to human health and prevent the degradation of the environment by the use of mechanisms that promote the following:

...
(ii) the reduction to harmless levels of the discharge of substances likely to cause harm to the environment,
(iia) the elimination of harmful wastes,
(iii) the reduction in the use of materials and the re-use, recovery or recycling of materials,
...

(e) to rationalise, simplify and strengthen the regulatory framework for environment protection,
....

17These objects operate at a level of generality which no doubt informs the specific regulatory scheme contained in the text of the Act. They are, however, of no significant assistance in resolving the present questions. Rather, it is necessary to focus on the language used in the various provisions, read in their statutory context.

18There are various general law principles of statutory interpretation which have the potential to operate in the present case. These include syntactical presumptions and other grammatical aids, including those set out, for example, in Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, (7th ed, 2011), Ch 4. There are also statutory directions and, in particular, the requirement in s 33 of the Interpretation Act 1987(NSW):

33 Regard to be had to purposes or objects of Acts and statutory rules

In the interpretation of a provision of an Act ..., a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act ...) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object.

19A difficulty with the application of this provision, identified in a number of leading authorities, is that it presumes it is possible to identify ""the purpose or object underlying the Act"", whereas legislation frequently involves conflicting policies and interests which it seeks to balance, one against the other. To identify, at a high level of generality, an underlying purpose or object is unlikely to assist in the construction of a specific provision or even phrase or, as in the present case, word. Furthermore, some provisions may be specifically directed to limiting the effects or consequences of a broad application of the underlying purpose of the legislation, but it does not follow that they should not be given their full effect, in accordance with the language used by the legislature. 

20The Interpretation Act also provides for the use of extrinsic material:

34 Use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of Acts and statutory rules

(1) In the interpretation of a provision of an Act or statutory rule, if any material not forming part of the Act or statutory rule is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given to that material: 
(a) to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the Act or statutory rule and the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule and, in the case of a statutory rule, the purpose or object underlying the Act under which the rule was made), or

(b) to determine the meaning of the provision:
(i) if the provision is ambiguous or obscure, or
(ii) if the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the Act or statutory rule and the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule and, in the case of a statutory rule, the purpose or object underlying the Act under which the rule was made) leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.

21As Spigelman CJ has noted, this empowering provision depends upon a somewhat value-laden condition, namely that the extrinsic material is in fact ""capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision"": Harrison v Melhem [2008] NSWCA 67; 72 NSWLR 380 at [12]. That language leaves unresolved the question of the manner in which such assistance is to be derived. The parties did not indicate there was any principle to be gleaned from the earlier legislation or the parliamentary debates, except in relation to the new paragraph (d) in the 2006 legislation. That paragraph expands the concept of waste to substances that have been processed etc, but only where regulations so provide. Paragraph (d) had no operation, in part because the substances were not relevantly processed and also because there were no regulations in force at the times covered by the second charge.

22Beyond those principles, and subject to matters of emphasis and priority, it is clear that ""the task of statutory construction must begin with a consideration of the text itself"", as noted in Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue [2009] HCA 41; 239 CLR 27 at [47]. The passage in the joint reasons in Alcan further stated:

""The meaning of the text may require consideration of the context, which includes the general purpose and policy of a provision, in particular the mischief it is seeking to remedy.""

23Spigelman CJ, writing extra-judicially, said that that approach is entirely consistent with earlier statements in CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd [1997] HCA 2; 187 CLR 384 at 408 and Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 at [69]: see Spigelman JJ, ""The Intolerable Wrestle: Developments in Statutory Interpretation"" (2010) 84 ALJ 822 at 828-829; and see Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Media Holdings Ltd [2012] HCA 55; 87 ALJR 98 at [39]. This approach is also consistent with that adopted by the High Court in Pilbara Infrastructure Pty Ltd v Australian Competition Tribunal [2012] HCA 36; 246 CLR 379. In considering the meaning of ""uneconomical"" in the context of legislation which provided for possible access by third parties to infrastructure facilities where it would be ""uneconomical for anyone to develop another facility"", the High Court gave consideration to a broad range of contextual and extrinsic material: at [94]-[98].

24Statements of principle applicable to statutory construction can result in an over-sophisticated formulation with reliance on a variety of presumptions, maxims and rules. On the other hand, failure to articulate the approach being undertaken is liable to give rise to inconsistency and a lack of transparency. Although the legislative regime regulating the transport and disposal of waste is complex, it is desirable that, where possible, the language used should be construed in a manner which is reasonably accessible to those whose activities are subject to regulation.

Charge - first period
25Addressing the period covered by the first charge, the definition of ""waste"" in s 143(4) referred only to ""any unwanted or surplus substance"". It further noted that a substance ""is not precluded from being waste"" merely because it ""may be"" reprocessed, reused or recycled. In adopting that specific definition, the legislature expressly refrained from applying to this offence the general definition found in the Dictionary to the Act. In part, that choice was understandable. Thus, paragraph (a) of the Dictionary definition, referring to discharges, emissions and deposits, is not obviously relevant to an offence which focuses on transportation. No doubt that which is transported may be deposited so as to alter the environment, but depositing is not part of transportation: see further the discussion of the defence in sub-s (3C), at [37] below.

26Within paragraph (b) in the special definition, the legislature chose the words ""unwanted"" and ""surplus"", but did not include ""discarded"", ""rejected"" and ""abandoned"". This may have been intended to simplify the definition by avoiding words which would probably not be engaged with respect to an offence of transportation and which did not, in any event, engage any significantly different concepts. Each of the extra words describes a characteristic resulting from an activity of the owner (discarding, rejecting, abandoning) which may demonstrate a state of mind consistent with not needing or wanting the substance.

27What is less clear is why the definition in s 143(4) omitted reference to what was paragraph (c) in the Dictionary definition. That in turn gives rise to a question as to whether paragraph (c), referring to an ""otherwise discarded ... substance intended for sale or for recycling ..."" was an extension of paragraph (b) or merely a clarification of its intended scope. At least in the present case, there was no evidence that the original owner had any intention of the kind referred to in paragraph (c); nevertheless, the relevance of the paragraph for present purposes is the light it may throw upon the scope of the language used in paragraph (b) and in s 143(4). 

28There is a further difference between the language of s 143(4) and the definition in the Dictionary. The final sentence of s 143(4) as to non-preclusion, refers to a substance which ""may be"" reprocessed, reused or recycled. In the Dictionary definition, the reference is to a substance which ""can be"" reprocessed etc. The former appears to refer to a possible expectation of a person, the latter to a capacity of the substance. It is, perhaps, unlikely that any variation in meaning was intended, but the variation in language suggests that limited assistance as to the scope of s 143(4) can be obtained by a comparison with the Dictionary definition which was excluded. It is unproductive to seek further guidance from the exclusion of paragraph (c).

29Viewed in isolation, the language of s 143(4) would be understood to refer to substances which were unwanted by their owner, or surplus to the needs of the owner. Whilst they might cease to be waste at some point if reprocessed, reused or recycled, the fact that such a course may be undertaken in the future by another person, would not prevent the substance being waste in the hands of the owner and hence at the point at which transportation commenced.

30Before reaching a final conclusion as to the meaning of the term ""waste"" in s 143, it is proper to have regard to the full scope of the offence. A further essential element of the offence is that waste is transported ""to a place"", of a specified character. That requires reference to the definition of a ""waste facility"" and the limits on the lawful use of places as waste facilities for particular waste.

31Critical to the scheme of the Act is the concept of a ""scheduled activity"", which means an activity listed in Schedule 1 to the Act: see s 5(1) and Dictionary, scheduled activity. Schedule 1, relevantly for present purposes, identifies in Part 1 activities described as ""premises-based"". The occupier of premises at which a scheduled activity is carried on must hold a licence with respect to that activity: s 48(2). The trial judge found (a finding not challenged on appeal) that the use of premises for such an activity in circumstances where the owner did not have a licence satisfied the requirement in s 143 that the place could not ""lawfully"" be used for that activity.

32Throughout the two periods covered by the charges, Schedule 1, Part 1 contained an alphabetical listing of premises-based activities, which included ""waste facilities"". Those included ""land fill or application sites"" within the Sydney metropolitan area: item (1)(f). It was common ground that the land where the liquid was deposited was within the Sydney metropolitan area and that the exceptions in paragraph (f) did not apply. (There was an issue as to whether a separate exception applied, which will be addressed below.) Schedule 1 (which was significantly amended in 2008) contained its own interpretive provisions, in Part 3. For the purpose of certain activities relating to waste, including ""waste facilities"", the term ""land fill or application site"" was defined as follows:

landfill or application site means a waste facility used for the purpose of disposing waste to land, including (but not limited to) disposal by any of the following methods:
...
(c) injecting the waste into the land ....

33The trial judge found, largely on the basis of agreed facts, that the Bringelly farmland was used in a manner which rendered it a ""landfill or application site"" and thus a ""waste facility"" within the meaning of the Schedule. It was common ground that the owner did not have a relevant licence.

34The applicant's contention, below and in this Court, did not challenge the proposition that the liquids transported were unwanted or surplus in the hands of the UR-3R facility, but rather contended that they were no longer unwanted, nor surplus, once loaded on the appellant's tanker. At that point, their transportation became part of the appellant's business and the deposit of the liquid into the soil at Bringelly was accepted by the owner of the land, who therefore 'wanted' them. Accordingly, the liquids were ""wanted"" from the moment they were placed in the truck until they were disposed of, with the consequence that they did not constitute ""waste"" at any point during transportation. This submission must be rejected, because it cannot stand with the statutory scheme. If correct, it would follow that no material, whilst in transit, was waste, so long as it was transported as part of a business and that the intended recipient accepted it willingly. Nor did it assist to characterise the liquid as having a beneficial use when disposed of on the farmland at Bringelly.

35That conclusion may be supported by reference to a further exception to the definition of ""waste facility"" in Schedule 1 to the Act, relied upon by the appellant as engaged in the present case. Thus, paragraph (3) provided:

(3) The following premises are not waste facilities for the purposes of this item:
...
(d1) premises (being premises in ... the Sydney metropolitan area) on which any one or more of the following types of organic waste (and no other type of waste) is applied to land for agricultural or environmental rehabilitation purposes:

(i) garden waste, 
(ii) biosolids categorised as Unrestricted Use in accordance with the criteria set out in the Biosolids Guidelines, 
(iii) biosolids categorised as Restricted Use 1, 2 or 3 in accordance with the criteria set out in the Biosolids Guidelines (but only if they are applied to land in accordance with those Guidelines),
(iv) liquid food waste, 
(v) manure,
(vi) treated grease trap waste from the preparation or manufacturing of food,
(vii) any mixture of the types of wastes specified in subparagraphs (i)-(vi).

36If the appellant's argument were correct, the careful selection of criteria to be found in this (and other) exceptions, would be futile. Substances applied to land for agricultural purposes would not be waste at all, because, it may be presumed, their application would be wanted by those carrying out the agricultural purposes, as in the present case. The careful delineation of the areas covered and the precise kinds of waste which can be applied would constitute an exercise in futility. A construction of the legislative scheme which had that effect cannot be accepted. 

37Further, as the trial judge noted, the argument for the appellant relied in part upon the defence provided by s 143(3C), which was established if ""the waste transported by the defendant was not deposited ... at the place to which it was transported"". This argument accepted that the relevant wants or needs were those of the owner of the substance, but contended that as depositing was an essential element of the offence, the attitude of the owner of the substance at the point of deposit was relevant to determining whether or not the substance was ""waste"".

38The fallacy in this submission lies in the proposition that the defence involved negativing an element of the offence. It clearly did not: the elements of the offence were established by transportation of waste to a place having the proscribed characteristic. Nothing in the language of s 143(1) suggests that depositing the waste was an element necessary for completion of the offence: the fact that non-deposit of the waste is a defence to be affirmatively established by the defendant is consistent with that conclusion. Even were that conclusion not correct, the submission should be rejected for the reasons previously given, based on futility. 

39For these reasons, which are consistent with those relied upon by the trial judge in respect of the points now raised, the appeal in respect of the first charge must be dismissed.

Application of principles - second period
40The conduct involved in the second period charged was substantially identical to that undertaken in the first period. The differential factor arose from the change in the relevant definition of ""waste"". Not only was s 143(4) repealed, but the Dictionary definition was amended in two significant respects. First, it was expanded to include ""any processed ... substance produced wholly or partly from waste that is applied to land ... but only in the circumstances prescribed by the regulations"": new paragraph (d). Because there were no relevant regulations, this provision had no direct application to the facts of the present case. It is not necessary, therefore, to consider whether the substance applied to the land was relevantly ""produced ... from waste"". Rather, the significance of the new paragraph for present purposes lies in a variation in the language used in the final non-preclusion provision at the end of the definition. In the earlier definition, a substance was not precluded from being waste merely because it ""can be"" reprocessed etc; the new language operates where the substance ""is or may be processed, recycled, re-used or recovered"". This expansion is evidently intended to reflect the language of paragraphs (c) and (d). (Paragraph (c) now also refers to ""processing"", whereas it previously referred to ""reprocessing"": this change is not presently significant.)

41There is no basis for construing the new definition of ""waste"" as more restrictive than the earlier definition, or the definition in s 143(4) which applied to the first charge. Indeed, paragraph (c) expressly contemplates that discarded (etc) substances might be intended for sale or recycling (etc) and would yet constitute waste. The effect of that provision will be likely to include material which would not ordinarily be described as waste and will thus constitute an expansion of the ordinary meaning of the term. Because the language of unwanted or surplus substances, which was applied in respect of the first charge, has equal application to the second charge, the same result must follow. It is, accordingly, not necessary to consider whose intention may be covered by the expansive terms of paragraph (c). The appeal in respect of the conviction on the second charge must also be dismissed.

		20 March 2014",2013-08-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706369,Ho v R [2013] NSWCCA 174,"Judgment

1EMMETT JA: This proceeding is an application for leave to appeal against sentence imposed on the applicant by the District Court on 27 July 2012. The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug and one count of knowingly allowing premises to be used as drug premises, exposing a child to prohibited drugs. The offences are created by the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of nine years, comprising a non-parole period of six years and a balance of term of three years. The only ground of appeal pressed was that the sentencing judge erred in determining the non-parole period on the basis that the sentence offended the parity principle. 

2The applicant pleaded guilty to the offences in the Local Court and a co-offender was dealt with on the same day, who also pleaded guilty to the offences with which he was charged. Both the applicant and the co-offender received a 25% discount for early pleas of guilty. 

3The applicant faced the more serious charges. The charges reflected her role as a broker, as distinct from the co-offender, whose role was that of a courier. The applicant contended that the disparity between the respective ratios of the non-parole period to the total term of her sentence and the co-offender's sentence left her with a justifiable sense of grievance and that the sentencing judge erred in that regard. 

4I have read the proposed reasons of Schmidt J in draft form. I agree with her Honour that the sentences imposed on the applicant and the co-offender reflect the differences in the degree of their culpability for the conduct for which they were sentenced and that the result does not reveal error on the part of the sentencing judge. Rather, the result reflects the differences in the respective circumstances of the applicant and the co-offender. 

5I agree, for the reasons proposed by Schmidt J, that leave to appeal out of time should be granted, that leave to appeal against the sentence be granted and that the appeal be dismissed. 

6FULLERTON J: I agree with Schmidt J.

7SCHMIDT J: Hue Pham Ho seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon her by Arnott DCJ on 27 July 2012. She had pleaded guilty to one count of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely 352.2 grams of heroin, under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse And Trafficking Act 1985 and one count of knowingly allowing premises to be used as drug premises, exposing a child to prohibited drugs under s 36Y(2) of that Act.

8In sentencing Ms Ho his Honour also took into account four charges on a Form 1 under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, namely:


Two charges of knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime intending to conceal, $25,000 Australian currency and $10,623 US currency, pursuant to s 193B(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalties for which were 20 years imprisonment.


One charge of deal with property suspected to be proceeds of crime, $66,500.25 under s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act the maximum penalty for which was 2 years imprisonment.


One charge of owner/occupier knowingly allowing premises to be used as drug premises, exposing a child prohibited drugs under s 36Y(2) of the Drug Misuse And Trafficking Act penalty for which was 12 months imprisonment.


9For the s 36Y(2)(a) offence, which carried a maximum penalty of 14 months for a first offence and 6 years for subsequent offences, Ms Ho was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of one month, commencing 24 February 2011 and expiring on 23 March 2011. For the s 25(2) offence, which carried a maximum penalty of 20 years, Ms Ho was sentenced to a total sentence of 9 years, comprising a non-parole period of 6 years imprisonment, commencing 24 March 2011 and expiring on 23 March 2017, with a balance of term of 3 years to expire on 23 March 2020. 

10The application for leave to appeal dated 19 February 2013 was filed out of time. There was no affidavit explaining the delay of six months between sentence and the filing of the application. The Crown's formal position was that the proposed ground of appeal was without merit and accordingly, the extension sought should be refused and the application dismissed. In the circumstances, for reasons which follow, in my view the extension of time and leave to appeal should be granted, but the appeal dismissed. 

11Ms Ho pressed only one ground of appeal, namely, that his Honour had erred in determining the non-parole period, which offended the parity principle. 

12Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires that a non-parole period be not less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence imposed, unless special circumstances are found for it being less. In Ms Ho's case his Honour found that special circumstances existed. The ratio of the non-parole period to the total term imposed was 67%.

13The appeal was pressed in circumstances where Ms Ho had pleaded guilty to the offences charged in the Local Court. The sentence hearing proceeded on 20 June 2012. That day her two co-offenders were also dealt with. They had also pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the offences with which they were charged. There was no complaint as to his Honour's conclusion as to the objective seriousness, or the total sentences imposed upon them. All three offenders received a 25% discount for their early plea. 

14Ms Ho faced the more serious supply charge (being supply of a commercial quantity under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985), reflective of her role as a broker, as opposed to that of the co-offender, Kaiqui Situ, whose role was that of a courier of drugs supplied on her behalf. 

15Mr Situ was sentenced for five offences of supplying a prohibited drug under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse And Trafficking Act, namely quantities of heroin between 7 and 82.5 grams. Those offences each carried a maximum penalty of 15 years. He was sentenced to a total term of 6 years, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years imprisonment, with a balance of term of 3 years.

16In Mr Situ's case his Honour concluded that he should have an additional discount of 5% from his total sentence, on account of the assistance he had given to authorities. His Honour also found special circumstances in his case, with the result, however, that a ratio of 50% of the non-parole period to the total term was applied. There is no Crown appeal from that finding. 

17It was the disparity in the respective ratios between non-parole period and balance of term which followed from the finding of special circumstances in the case of these two offenders, which gave rise to Ms Ho's appeal. It was argued for Ms Ho that the result of the sentencing exercise had left her with a justifiable sense of grievance, there being no justification in her personal circumstances relative to Mr Situ's to warrant such a disparity. 

18There was no dispute between the parties as to the applicable law. A finding of special circumstances reflects the personal characteristics of an offender, which will commonly differ between co-offenders. As Howie J discussed in R v Wahabzadah [2001] NSWCCA 253 at [16], disparity only arises when the difference between the two sentences cannot be justified by a difference in the degree of the culpability of the offenders, or in their personal circumstances. A breach of the parity principle will not have occurred ""simply because different non-parole periods are specified for different co-offenders because of different findings as to the existence, or extent, of special circumstances"" (at [15] - see also R v Do [2005] NSWCCA 209, Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398, Lau v R [2010] NSWCCA 43 and Sevastopoulos v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 201). 

19Where, however, the personal circumstances of co-offenders are relevantly indistinguishable, but different findings as to special circumstances are reached, a justifiable sense of grievance as to the relationship between a non-parole period and overall sentence may result (see Lau v R at [15] - [17]).

20Ms Ho's case was that there was nothing in the co-offender's personal circumstances which could justify the disparity in the ratios which his Honour arrived at.

21The Crown's case was that Ms Ho's offending was more serious than that of Mr Situ. That was reflected in his Honour's findings as to the objective seriousness of their offences, the sentences imposed and the non-parole periods specified. The proper application of the law required the non-parole period imposed on Ms Ho to reflect the criminality of her offending and to adequately denunciate the offences she had committed. In the circumstances, no error was involved in his Honour's conclusions.

22The conclusions reached by his Honour as to special circumstances in Ms Ho's case were: 

""I find special circumstances given the offender's need for rehabilitation and supervision in the community, in view of her drug and gambling problems, her past lack of employment and the absence of a positive social network of friends and family.""


23The conclusions reached by his Honour in Mr Situ's case were:

""I find special circumstances given the offender's long-standing drug problem and his lack of employment over the last ten years. There is a clear need for rehabilitation and supervision of the community in view of these matters.""


24There was no explanation as to why in Ms Ho's case a ratio of 67% between non-parole period and balance of term was imposed, while in Mr Situ's case the ratio was 50%. The explanation lies in the consequences of the application of those ratios to the sentences imposed in each case. The result was that both Ms Ho and Mr Situ will be eligible for extended supervision on parole for a period of 3 years, after they have served their respective non-parole periods. In Ms Ho's case that will be after a mandatory period of imprisonment of 6 years and 1 month and in Mr Situ's case, after a mandatory period of imprisonment of 3 years.

25The conclusion that they should each be eligible to a period of extended supervision on parole for 3 years rested, no doubt, in the similarity of the evidence upon which they each relied for a finding of special circumstances, namely the necessity for them to be assisted in their rehabilitation and for supervision in the process.

26Evidence as to Ms Ho's personal circumstances (some only which were relevant to a finding of special circumstances) came from a psychologist's report, tendered without objection. It was there observed that she had limited command of English and had been interviewed with the assistance of an interpreter. She was then aged 45 years, having come to Australia to reside with her Australian - Vietnamese husband in 1995 or 1996. He had lied to her about his circumstances. She had no family in Australia, other than her husband's family, with whom she did not get along. They had separated shortly after the birth of her daughter, when he became physically abusive. After their separation she had struggled financially and had been forced to return to him. There had been ongoing domestic violence. She had conceived another child, who was born in custody, as the result, she believed, of a sexual assault while drug affected. She was allowed to contact her children only once per year by DOCS.

27Ms Ho had been educated to the equivalent of only year 7 in Vietnam. In Australia she had worked as a dishwasher until the birth of her daughter. Ms Ho was introduced to heroin in 1997 to 1998 and had developed a dependence which soon led to her dealing in drugs to support her addiction. She was charged with aggravated offences in 2002, 2004 and 2005. She had participated in the Drug Court program in 2006. Her drug use had resumed subsequently. She also had a long-standing gambling problem.

28Ms Ho was subjected to intelligence testing, her score placing her within the low-range for non-verbal intelligence, consistent with the presentation and history of education and employment. She was found to have developed symptoms of depression, for which she had not received treatment in the past, but had used heroin to self medicate. She had abstained from substances since incarceration and reported a desire to cease gambling. Formal treatment was recommended. The lack of any pro-social support network within her life was considered a matter of concern. Severe symptoms of depression, stress and anxiety were observed. Treatment for substance dependence, gambling and mental health difficulties, avoiding antisocial associates and obtaining suitable community-based support post-release, employment and accommodation was considered to be required, as was close monitoring and support from the probation and parole service.

29Mr Situ gave evidence with the assistance of an interpreter. He was not cross-examined. He was born in China and was then aged almost 50 years. He had suffered ill health in China for some 20 years, having there contracted hepatitis and a stomach ulcer. He had completed high school in China and then worked in manufacturing for 12 years, before running his own business, making shoes, for three years. He was married and had migrated to Australia in 1995, with the sponsorship of his elder sister. He then undertook various casual work. He had separated from his wife in 1999 and had no children. He lived with his 90-year-old mother, but had no contact with his siblings, as the result of his incarceration.

30Mr Situ commenced using heroin in 1997. In 1999 he tried to stop, after a court case, with the assistance of a doctor. In 2009 he commenced using heroin again, when he was unable to find work. He had been working on and off, to that point, for some 10 years. He was on a methadone program in prison, but had not yet undertaken a drug course, which he wished to pursue. He proposed to seek further assistance once released.

31It is in those circumstances that, in my view, it must be concluded that Ms Ho's case was not made out. 

32The consequences of a finding of special circumstances under s 44(2) are often expressed in terms of the extent to which the statutory ratio is disturbed, but it is the consequences of that finding, in terms of the extent of the period of supervision on parole to which the offender is being given access, after serving a minimum term of imprisonment, to which attention must be paid if error is later asserted.

33Such a finding is a discretionary finding on the facts found (see R v El-Hayek (2004) 144 A Crim R 90; [2004] NSWCCA 25 at [103]; Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [28]). It is a finding with which this Court will be slow to intervene and then usually only if the non-parole period imposed is manifestly inadequate or excessive (see R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [36]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [19]; Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83]). In setting a balance of term when such a finding is made, disproportionate weight must not be given to the subjective circumstances of the offender (see R v Ceissman [2004] NSWCCA 466 at [25]; R v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269) and care must be taken to ensure against double counting (see Langbein v R [2013] NSWCCA 88 at [54]). 

34A complaint of disparity accepts that the sentence imposed is otherwise appropriate (see England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [22]; Jimmy v R (2010) 269 ALR 115; [2010] NSWCCA 60 at [251].) 

35The parity principle was discussed in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295; [1997] HCA 26 at 301:

""The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them [See Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610-11; 54 ALR 193 per Mason J]. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error [Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 617-18; 54 ALR 193 per Brennan J]. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in Lowe v The Queen [(1984) 154 CLR 606; 54 ALR 193], recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ""a justifiable sense of grievance"" [Lowe v R (1984) 54 ALR 193 ; 154 CLR 606 especially at 610 per Gibbs CJ, 613 per Mason J and 623 per Dawson J]. If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options.

Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.""


36While disparity between non-parole periods which cannot be justified by differences in offenders' personal circumstances, can result in a justifiable sense of grievance, in this case, despite the different ratios adopted by his Honour, the non-parole periods actually imposed are not different. They are identical, reflective of his Honour's intention that Ms Ho and Mr Situ should have access to the same period on parole, given the similarity in their personal circumstances and the need for their supervision to ensure some transition into the community upon their release. 

37A period of 3 years on parole also reflects the impact of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008 (see Baghdadi v R [2012] NSWCCA 212 at [45] - [47]). Clause 228 of that Regulation imposes a practical limit of three years on the parole supervision which an offender such as Ms Ho may receive. Longer supervision is available in the case of a ""serious offender"" relevantly defined in s 3(1) of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 as:

""(c) an offender who is serving a sentence (or one of a series of sentences of imprisonment) where the term of the sentence (or the combined terms of all of the sentences in the series) is such that the offender will not become eligible for release from custody, including release on parole, until he or she has spent at least 12 years in custody,""


38That is not Ms Ho's situation. The sentences imposed on Ms Ho and Mr Situ otherwise reflect the differences in the degree of their culpability for the offending conduct for which they were each being sentenced. For her offending his Honour concluded that in total her sentence should be 9 years and 1 month and for Mr Situ's offending, a sentence of 6 years was imposed, with non-parole periods of 6 years and 1 month and 3 years, respectively. 

39That result does not reveal error. Rather, it reflects the relevant differences in the respective nature and seriousness of their offending. 

40Ms Ho was being sentenced for more serious offences than Mr Situ, reflective of their respective roles in the criminal enterprise in which they were both involved. On sentence Ms Ho also had four other offences taken into account on the Form 1, including two which had maximum penalties of 20 years. That necessarily had the result that the sentence imposed upon her had to be increased significantly. As discussed by Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146:

""[42] The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences ... These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s 33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.""


41That well explains why Ms Ho was sentenced to a considerably longer non-parole period than was Mr Situ.

42In those circumstances, if his Honour had applied the same ratio for the special circumstances he found in each case, that is a ratio of 50%, the result would have been that Ms Ho would have been sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 7 months, with a balance of 4 years and 6 months. Such a non-parole period would not have properly reflected the nature and seriousness of her offending. To the contrary, it would plainly have been inadequate. It would also have provided a basis for complaint on Mr Situ's part, as to disparity.

43Further, nothing in the evidence as to Ms Ho's personal circumstances provides a basis for the conclusion that a finding of special circumstances warranted a longer period of supervision on parole than that provided for in Mr Situ's sentence. A period of 4 years and 6 months would have been 1 year and 6 months longer than his Honour considered appropriate for Mr Situ. The evidence established no difference in their personal circumstances which would have warranted this disparate result. Given the effect of the Regulations, in terms of supervision such a result would also have been futile.

44His Honour's conclusion that the special circumstances which the evidence established existed in the two cases were relevantly indistinguishable, was plainly correct. That well explains why a period on parole for 3 years was appropriate in both cases. 

45In the result, I am satisfied that his Honour's conclusion that special circumstances existed which warranted the exercise of the discretion granted by s 44 in Ms Ho's favour, can have left her with no justifiable sense of grievance. Both Ms Ho and Mr Situ will be entitled to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of their respective non-parole periods, if the Parole Authority is satisfied in accordance with the relevant statutory criteria that it is appropriate that they be released into the community for the extended period of supervision which his Honour considered that they each required, given their similar personal circumstances. 

46In the result, the orders I would propose are:

1. Leave to appeal out of time is granted.

2. Leave to appeal is granted.

3. The appeal is dismissed.

2706372,Ryan v R; Coulter v R [2013] NSWCCA 175,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: On 4 July 2011 Helen Kay Ryan and Coralie Coulter were convicted after jury trial, each on a single count of murder. By s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900, each became liable to imprisonment for life. By Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") a standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed.

2On 21 October 2011 Latham J sentenced Ryan to imprisonment for 36 years with a non-parole period of 27 years. Her Honour sentenced Coulter to imprisonment for 27 years with a non-parole period of 18 years. Both Ryan and Coulter filed notices of appeal against conviction, and applications for leave to appeal against sentence. On 8 April 2013 Ryan gave notice of abandonment of the appeal against conviction. She maintains her application for leave to appeal against sentence. Coulter has maintained the appeal against conviction and her application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
 
Background

3Helen Ryan is the daughter of Coralie Coulter. Another daughter of Coralie Coulter, Helen Ryan's sister, Ganene Coulter, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder and gave evidence in the trial. 

4The outline of facts that follows is largely drawn from the Remarks on Sentence of Latham J. 

5The victim of the murder was Helen Ryan's husband, Jeffrey Ryan. Helen Ryan and Jeffrey Ryan married in 1994. They lived together on a property near Tamworth (in the north of NSW) from 2001. Each had children from a previous relationship. Together they had one daughter (CR) who was aged 13 at the time of her father's death. 

6By early to mid 2008, the marriage of Helen Ryan and Jeffrey Ryan had deteriorated and Jeffrey Ryan had taken legal advice with a view to initiating divorce proceedings. Each made allegations of assault against the other, although these appear to have been relatively minor. As a result of an allegation by CR of assault against Jeffrey Ryan, and a consequent Apprehended Violence Order, Jeffrey Ryan moved out of the house and into a shipping container on the property, some distance from the house.

7On 23 October 2009 Jeffery Ryan was shot dead on the property, just outside the container in which he was living. A man called Ken Brooks was convicted of the shooting.

The Crown case

8The Crown case, which was accepted by the jury, was that Helen Ryan had contracted with Brooks to undertake the killing. She had agreed to pay him $30,000 for that purpose. 

9The evidence established to the satisfaction of Latham J to the requisite (criminal) standard that, while Jeffrey Ryan was resolute about ending the marriage, Helen Ryan wished the marriage to continue. She sought to interfere in a new relationship Jeffrey Ryan had begun with another woman. She had learned that Jeffrey Ryan had changed his will, to her detriment. These two factors provided the motivation for her arranging for the murder of her husband. Helen Ryan therefore initiated steps to arrange for Brooks to kill Jeffrey Ryan. She was introduced to Brooks by a man called Ian Carroll, also known as ""Sharkie"". She paid $15,000 by way of deposit, the balance of $15,000 to be paid after Jeffrey Ryan's death. Coulter contributed $10,000 of the deposit. Coulter provided the money to Helen Ryan after Helen Ryan had complained to her of Jeffrey Ryan's behaviour. In sentencing Latham J was satisfied that the accounts given by Helen Ryan to Coulter were ""grossly exaggerated"", and that Coulter believed those accounts. 

10Helen Ryan gave Brooks photographs of Jeffrey Ryan, and told him of Jeffrey Ryan's living circumstances and the location of the container. 

11On the evening of 23 October 2009 Jeffrey Ryan visited the main residence on the property and left between 7.30pm and 8.15pm and returned to the shipping container. At about 8.40pm, he went outside. Brooks was present, and fired at least two shots from a shotgun, killing Jeffrey Ryan.

12Following the murder, both Helen Ryan and Coralie Coulter went to some lengths to deflect suspicion from themselves. Their subsequent telephone conversations were the subject of lawful interception, and constituted a good part of the Crown case against them.

13Having regard to Coulter's ground of appeal against conviction, it is important to note the following aspect of the Crown case. From an early stage a police undercover operative, who gave his evidence under the name ""Shane"", had been involved in the investigation, and made contact with Helen Ryan, and Ganene and Coralie Coulter. All of his conversations with them were recorded pursuant to a warrant issued under the Surveillance Devices Act 2007.

14Notwithstanding the concealment measures she had taken, on 15 December 2009, Helen Ryan was charged with murder. Two days later, she was granted bail. On the same day, she accompanied Shane to the Local Court, with the intention of paying $10,000 to a person she believed to be a corrupt official who would arrange for the destruction of evidence. 

15In January 2010, Shane was introduced to Ganene and Coralie Coulter by Ian ""Sharkie"" Carroll, who was by then, acting at the behest of police. Both women were aware that police were investigating (Helen Ryan had already been charged) and believed that Carroll had introduced Shane with a view to his assisting them to deflect police inquiries. Both had lengthy conversations with him, which were recorded, and which featured heavily in the Crown case. One of the conversations with Coulter is central to the ground of appeal against conviction that she advances.

16This conversation took place on 12 January 2010 when Shane met Coulter at a park. They met just before 10am, and the meeting ended at 2.17pm. The recording of this conversation became Exhibit P in the trial. Shane told Coulter that he was there because ""Sharkie"" had asked Shane to do Sharkie a favour. She told him that she was under suspicion because she had withdrawn $10,000 from the bank. She said that she took the money out of the bank ""to pay this Ken [Brooks]"", and:

""I took $10,000 out of the bank to pay him for the job he done ... because Helen [Ryan] hasn't got any.""

Shane asked Coulter if Helen Ryan had told her what she wanted the money for. She answered:

""She just said she wanted the money to pay Ken [Brooks] to get rid of Jeff. Should I be telling you this?""

Shane told her that he needed to know everything so that he could help her and Helen Ryan out.

Coulter said:

""That's, that's why she said. She said, 'Oh,' and I said, 'Well, I'll give you,' he was giving her a terrible time. He was going to bury her alive and he was going to get somebody in Tamworth to do it, kill her and all this. It was just terrible.

...

Yeah, he was terrible to her. He was terrible to her. She, you know, even Sharky can give you that. You know, he said, he, he could feel that she was in a terrible position you know? Yeah, but I don't, I've never met this fellow that did it and Helen's only ever seen him once and ---""

In the conversation that immediately followed, Coralie Coulter made it quite clear that the arrangement with Brooks was to kill Jeffrey Ryan.

17A little while later the following was recorded:

SHANE: And what did you think, what, what did you think of Jeff, was he ---

COULTER: No, he was a horrible thing. He had another woman. But she wanted to divorce him ---

SHANE: Yeah.

COULTER: --- and he wouldn't do it.

SHANE: Okay.

COULTER: Yeah, he wouldn't do it. She said 'Get a divorce,' and he said 'No,' he wouldn't, he wouldn't even divorce her. He wanted everything and she, and he didn't want her to have anything see?

SHANE: Yeah.

COULTER: And that's how it was. And ---

SHANE: Jeez, you're a good mum, helping her out like that?

COULTER: Oh, well you do it for your kids don't you?

SHANE: Oh, exactly. Yeah, I've got a couple of little ones, you know?

COULTER: Yes, yes, you know?

SHANE: But I'd do anything for them.

COULTER: Yep, yep. Especially when she was, the life she was going through. Well, her daughter had an AVO out against him from school.

SHANE: Yeah.

COULTER: [CR], he was terrible to her, yes.

SHANE: Okay.

COULTER: Yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't, it was terrible. 

SHANE: How, how was he towards [CR]?

COULTER: Not nice.

SHANE: No?

COULTER: He said, he told her he used to tell her he hated her and all this, he was terrible to her. And the school made her take an AV[O], she was getting you know, bad at school and it was affecting her and they got to the bottom of it the school and they said, 'Oh, you'll have to take an AVO out against him.'

SHANE: Mmmm.

COULTER: And Helen said, Oh, no, she wouldn't do that. She said, it would only make him worse.

SHANE: Does [CR] know any of this?

COULTER: No, no.

18On 10 February 2010 Ryan attended Brooks' home in order to pay the balance of the contract price. She was arrested on that day, refused bail and has remained in custody since. Coralie Coulter was also arrested that day and has also remained in custody.

The defence cases

19Both Ryan and Coulter gave evidence in the trial. Ryan's evidence was to the effect that she had contracted Brooks to assault her husband, short of inflicting any serious harm upon him. She sought to cast the blame for arranging the murder on her sister Ganene Coulter, to whom she attributed hate, jealousy and resentment because Ganene Coulter had had a relationship with Jeffrey Ryan prior to his meeting Helen Ryan.

20In her evidence, Coralie Coulter acknowledged that she had been guilty of the offence of accessory after the fact of murder, but she denied participation in the murder. She said that she had lent Helen Ryan $10,000 to assist Jeffrey Ryan who was in financial trouble, and that she did not know until after the event that the money was used to pay for his murder.

21The jury rejected both defences. It is expressly conceded on behalf of Coulter, having regard to the terms of the conversation extracted above, that the verdict against her is supported by the evidence.

The conviction appeal

22Coulter has pleaded a single ground of appeal against conviction, as follows:

""The trial judge erred in failing to leave to the jury the partial defence under s 421 of the Crimes Act 1900.""

Senior counsel for Coulter acknowledged that, as no submission was put to the trial judge that the ""partial defence"" should be left to the jury, he needs leave to be permitted to argue the point: Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4. The point is without merit, and, for the reasons that follow, leave should be refused.

23Section 421 provides for the so-called ""partial defence"" shortly known as ""excessive self-defence"". It is called a partial defence because, if the necessary conditions are met, a person who would otherwise be convicted of murder is to be found guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter. The section is in the following terms:

""421 Self-defence-excessive force that inflicts death
(1) This section applies if: 

(a) the person uses force that involves the infliction of death, and
(b) the conduct is not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them,

but the person believes the conduct is necessary: 

(c) to defend himself or herself or another person, or
(d) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person.

(2) The person is not criminally responsible for murder but, on a trial for murder, the person is to be found guilty of manslaughter if the person is otherwise criminally responsible for manslaughter.""

The reference to ""the person"" is clear when s 421 is read in the context in which it appears. Section 421 appears in Pt 11 of the Crimes Act, which is headed ""Criminal responsibility - defences"". Division 3 of Pt 11 is headed ""Self-defence"", and commences with the sub-section:

""418(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence.""

It will be observed that, unlike s 421, s 418 is of general application, encompassing offences that do not result in death.

24The ""partial defence"" for which s 421 provides is not, in reality, a true defence. That is made clear by s 419. Section 419 provides:

""In any criminal proceedings in which the application of this Division is raised, the prosecution has the onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person did not carry out the conduct in self-defence.""

25Read literally, s 421 applies only to the person who uses the force that causes death. Taken in those terms, the section cannot be applicable to Coulter, as she did not inflict the force that caused the death of Jeffrey Ryan. However, senior counsel who appeared for Coulter argued that the protection afforded by the provision can extend, in a derivative way, to a person who aids and abets the person who inflicts the fatal force.

26It is unnecessary, in this case, to reach any conclusion as to that proposition. The Crown accepted that it is conceivable that some circumstances might give rise to such an interpretation. For example, a person who handed a gun or a knife to another person who was under immediate threat of being killed or injured might be able to claim the benefit of the section. Whether that is so does not arise for determination in the present case. Even if Coulter, as a person responsible for the death of Jeffrey Ryan, while not the person who used the force that caused his death, could avail herself of the benefit of the provision, the conditions necessary before the jury could have been invited to consider the defence were not met.

27The substance of s 421 is to be found in sub-s (2). Put simply, if the relevant conditions are met, then a person who would otherwise be convicted of murder, is to be convicted of manslaughter.

28The relevant conditions are:

(i)that the person accused used force that caused death;

(ii)that that use of force was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as the accused person perceived them.

If those two facts are established (and they must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution) then, ordinarily (absent the availability of some other defence or partial defence, such as mental illness, provocation, or substantial impairment), s 421 appears to provide for the reduction of the offence from murder to manslaughter in circumstances where:

(iii)the person accused believed that the use of force was necessary for one of the purposes specified in sub-para (c) and (d) - to defend himself or herself or another person (against what is not stated) or to prevent or terminate unlawful detention. It is of some note that there is no requirement that any such belief be reasonable, or be held on reasonable grounds.

I said that s 421 ""appears"" to provide for that reduction in circumstances where the person holds the stated belief. In fact, that is not quite correct. That is because of s 419. Although s 419 was not mentioned in either the written submissions or the oral argument advanced on behalf of Coulter, it is an important provision in understanding s 421. Section 419 provides:

""Self-defence-onus of proof
In any criminal proceedings in which the application of this Division is raised, the prosecution has the onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person did not carry out the conduct in self-defence.""

29Accordingly, the third necessary condition for s 421(2) to operate is that the Crown fails to prove that the person did not (subjectively) hold the relevant belief.

30It is, therefore, a misnomer to call the protection afforded by s 421(2) a ""defence"" or ""partial defence"". Disproof that the accused person held the belief is an essential element in the Crown case. But it becomes an essential element in the Crown case only when ""the application of [Div 3] is raised"". That can only mean ""raised by the accused person"" or ""raised on the evidence"". It is not in every case in which murder is charged that the Crown must set out to negative the belief. That obligation arises only where the provisions of Div 3 ""are raised"".

31What must be negatived by the Crown, where Div 3 issues are raised, is the state of mind of the accused person. That can be done, as well as through direct evidence of that accused person, by inference or by circumstantial evidence: see, for example, Braysich v The Queen [2011] HCA 14; 243 CLR 434 per Bell J (in dissent) [101].

32The issue in Braysich was whether a true defence - that is, a response to the Crown case in which both the legal and evidential onus was cast on the accused ([36], [101]) ought to have been left to the jury. In that context, the plurality said:

""35 Where, as in the present case, a statute creating an offence provides for a defence and imposes the legal burden of establishing that defence on the accused, then the accused also bears the evidential burden. For that evidential burden to be met there must be evidence upon which the trial judge can properly direct the jury that the defence is open as a matter of law.

36 If a trial judge has to consider whether, at the close of the evidence in a criminal trial, a particular defence should be left to the jury, the question which the trial judge will have to ask himself or herself will be: 

1. In a case where the legal burden is on the prosecution and the evidential burden on the accused - is there evidence which, taken at its highest in favour of the accused, could lead a reasonable jury, properly instructed, to have a reasonable doubt that each of the elements of the defence had been negatived? 

2. ...

...""

33The defence in question in Braysich involved the purpose of the accused in conducting himself as he did. In that context, the plurality went on to say:

""37 The appellant was not required to produce evidence of his subjective purpose or purposes in order to meet the legal burden of establishing the statutory defence. The legal burden on him was to prove on the balance of probabilities that he lacked the proscribed purpose. One way of doing that was to adduce or point to evidence inconsistent with the proposition that he had that purpose. He did not have to point to evidence of his actual purpose in order to invoke the defence. Any evidence that could support an inference that the appellant did not have the proscribed purpose was relevant to the statutory defence. The question whether he had discharged the 'evidential burden' was to be answered accordingly."" (italics added)

34Here, by reason of s 419, no legal burden rested on Coulter. One question that arises is whether, by reason of the words ""is raised"" in s 419, she bore an evidential burden. I incline to the view that she did not. That is because issues concerning Div 3 can be, and often are, raised in the prosecution case. However, it is unnecessary to resolve that question.

35It is well established that where a defence or possible defence (whether complete or partial) is capable of arising on the evidence, a trial judge is obliged to leave that defence or partial defence to the jury, even where that defence or partial defence is not being relied upon by the accused, and even if it has been disclaimed: Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107; Fingleton v The Queen [2005] HCA 34; 227 CLR 166.

36Important words in that formulation are ""on the evidence"". They hark back to the passages in Braysich, in [35] and [36] extracted above. 

37For application in Coulter's case, the test stated in [36] of Braysich may be paraphrased and adapted as follows:

""Was there evidence which, taken at its highest in favour of Coulter, could have led the jury, acting reasonably and properly instructed, to have considered that there was a reasonable possibility that she believed that her conduct in participating in the murder of Jeffrey Ryan was necessary in order to defend Helen Ryan or CR against Jeffrey Ryan?""

38What is now put is that there was evidence sufficient to raise the question whether Coulter believed that her participation in the murder was necessary in order to protect her daughter Helen Ryan, and Helen Ryan's daughter CR, against Jeffrey Ryan. Given that Coulter's evidence was that she did not know what Helen Ryan intended to use the money for, she did not give evidence of any belief that it was necessary for her to do what she did in order to defend Helen Ryan or CR. However, on her behalf, it was argued that there was, in the evidence in the Crown case, sufficient to meet the Braysich test as reformulated to take in the circumstances of the present case. 

39Reliance was placed upon those passages in the conversation with Shane of 12 January 2010, in which Coulter said that Jeffrey Ryan was giving Helen Ryan ""a terrible time ...""; and ""he was going to bury her alive and he was going to get somebody in Tamworth to do it, kill her and all this. It was just terrible ... She was in a terrible position"". Reference was also made to evidence that, when CR's school proposed an Apprehended Violence Order against Jeffrey Ryan, Helen Ryan responded that she would not do that because ""it would only make him worse"". 

40In this context, mention was also made of Latham J's characterisation of the accounts given by Helen Ryan to Coulter of Jeffrey Ryan's conduct as ""grossly exaggerated"", and Coulter's belief in those grossly exaggerated accounts.

41It is one thing to say that the evidence of Coulter's conversation with Shane went some way to providing an explanation for her conduct. It is a very different thing to characterise an explanation for participating in a crime as a belief that that conduct was necessary - necessary for the stated purpose, or one of the stated purposes. The evidence of what Coulter said to Shane is capable of throwing some light on why Coulter did what she did. It falls far short of even having the capacity to constitute evidence that Coulter had the requisite belief - that the murder of Jeffrey Ryan was necessary in order to defend Helen Ryan and/or CR.

42The notion that a court might be called upon to direct a jury that a contract killing, if motivated by a (subjective) belief in its necessity for defensive purposes, ought to result in a conviction for manslaughter rather than murder is both repugnant and abhorrent. Yet the language of s 421 appears to comprehend just that - provided that its benefit can fall upon a person other than the person who uses actual force. Subject to that question, if Coulter had given evidence that she held the requisite belief, or if there had been evidence in the Crown case that she held that belief, Latham J would have been obliged to leave the question to the jury.

43However, it is not necessary to grapple with the implications of s 421. Put simply, there was no evidence that would have supported leaving the s 421 issue to the jury. That, no doubt, is why the question was not raised in the trial.

44I would refuse leave to argue the only ground advanced. I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.

The applications for leave to appeal against sentence

The applicants' personal circumstances 

(i) Helen Ryan

45Helen Ryan was born in May 1960. She was 49 at the date of the offence, 51 at sentencing. Latham J was provided with a report by a psychologist, Ms Anna Robilliard. The report pre-dates the trial, and was, presumably, commissioned with a view to ascertaining if there were any available defences or partial defences to the charge of murder. It did not disclose anything relevant in that respect. The author reported a history given by Ryan of a childhood dysfunctional relationship with her mother, and the death of her father, to whom she was devoted, when she was 17. Ryan told Ms Robilliard that she became pregnant at 15, and was ""kicked out"" of home by her mother. She remained for 17 years in a relationship with the father of her child, although he was a heavy drinker and consistently verbally abusive and intermittently physically abusive. Ryan is in good physical health. She has no previous criminal history.

(ii) Coralie Coulter

46Coralie Coulter was born in October 1939 and was 70 years of age at the time she participated in the arrangements to have Jeffrey Ryan murdered. She was 72 at sentencing. Before the Court was a pre-sentence report based on information supplied by Coulter, and confirmed by others of her children.

47The report stated that her husband died in 1987, aged 47. The couple had six children, two of whom were Ganene Coulter and Helen Ryan. To the author of the report, Coulter continued to assert her innocence, saying that she was unaware of the plan to kill Jeffrey Ryan. She said that she lent money to Helen Ryan because she had been told that the couple were in financial difficulties. She also has no prior criminal convictions. 

The Remarks on Sentence

48For the purposes of sentencing, Latham J set out the facts of which she was satisfied; those which were adverse to the applicants, she found established beyond reasonable doubt; those which were in their favour, she found established on the balance of probabilities.

49She was satisfied that Helen Ryan had, prior to the murder, and in order to gain support for her plan from Coralie Coulter and Ganene Coulter, given accounts of Jeffrey Ryan's behaviour that were grossly exaggerated. She nevertheless accepted that there were some, relatively minor, instances of assault by Jeffrey Ryan on Helen Ryan, and one occasion on which Jeffrey Ryan pushed or threw a bag of feed towards CR. Under no circumstances could it be said that these incidents justified the course that was taken by Helen Ryan and by Coralie Coulter.

50Latham J also recounted the steps taken by Ryan and Coulter following the murder, for the purposes of concealing their involvement. This included Ryan's attempt, through Shane, to bribe a supposedly corrupt court official to destroy evidence.

51With respect to Ryan, she said:

""14 By its verdict, the jury determined that Helen Ryan deliberately and methodically plotted to have her husband killed, and that she enlisted the aid of her mother and her sister to bring about that result and avoid the possibility of detection for the offence. Far from the cowering, oppressed and terrorised wife that she attempted to portray, Helen Ryan embarked on a cold-blooded plan to get rid of her husband, rather than risk the dissolution of the marriage and the loss or diminution of the assets that they had jointly acquired.

15 The objective gravity of this offence is of a very high order. The callousness with which both offenders embarked upon this plan and carried it to fruition, knowing that it would deprive Mr Ryan's extended family of a much loved father, brother and son, not to mention Helen Ryan's own daughter of a father, beggars belief. In my view, the offence falls very close to the worst category for offences of this type.

16 In the case of Helen Ryan, the offence is worthy of the description 'wicked' and 'gravely reprehensible'. To contemplate and carry out such a plan for purely selfish and largely financial motives demonstrates heinousness to a significant degree. There was a considerable deal of persistence exhibited by Helen Ryan. The killing was to have taken place weeks earlier but was called off by Mr Brooks. Throughout this period of time, the offender was acutely aware that there were agencies in the community, such as the police, the legal profession and the Family Court, which were capable of advocating on her behalf so as to preserve her lawful interests. She deliberately chose to exact revenge upon her husband. On the night that he was killed, Helen Ryan received a call from Mr Brooks and informed him that her husband had left the house. I am satisfied to the requisite standard that she did so, knowing that she was sending her husband to his death."" (italics added)

Notwithstanding these findings, her Honour considered and rejected the Crown submissions that Ryan's offence fell into the worst category of offences of murder and called for a sentence of imprisonment for life. She said:

""17 ... In particular, there does not appear to be a compelling need to protect the community from this offender. There is no material which justifies the conclusion that this was not a gross aberration. There is no reason to think that she represents an ongoing danger to the community at large.""

These remarks were made in the context of a hypothetical consideration of the sentence that would have been imposed had she acceded to the Crown submission that Ryan's offence was a ""worst category"" case. Essentially, her Honour was here addressing the considerations raised by s 61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act (which requires, in certain specific circumstances, the imposition of a life sentence). Her conclusion was that, even if she categorised the offence as a ""worst case"", that did not necessarily dictate the imposition of a life sentence.

52In concluding her Remarks concerning Ryan, her Honour said:

""35 It is clear that the offender refuses to take responsibility for the murder of her husband and must therefore be sentenced on the basis that she demonstrates no remorse or contrition. Her prospects of rehabilitation therefore remain guarded. I can see no basis upon which the Court should find special circumstances [for the purpose of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act], particularly given that the length of the sentence necessarily imports a lengthy parole period which should be more than sufficient to allow the offender to re-engage with the community.""

53With respect to Coulter, her Honour held, by reference to the intercepted telephone conversations, that Coulter was ""integral to the contract with Brooks, in the sense that she provided the bulk of the deposit that initiated the killing"". She held also that Coulter actively and consistently encouraged Ryan and Ganene Coulter ""to remain firm in the face of the police investigation"" after the death. She found it difficult to comprehend the participation of Coulter, given that Coulter had acknowledged that she previously regarded Jeffrey Ryan as a good husband and father, and had no personal motive for participating in his murder. Her Honour accepted that Coulter's involvement was prompted by fabricated allegations made by Helen Ryan against Jeffrey Ryan, but held that she was, at every stage of the process, a willing and active participant.

54Her Honour held that Coulter's criminality was of a lesser order than that of Ryan, because she was not the instigator of the plot, and, apart from providing the money, played no direct role in the negotiations with Brooks that preceded the killing. She was persuaded that Coulter's participation could be explained (although never justified) by her genuine belief that her daughter and granddaughter were being subjected to gross physical and possible sexual abuse.

55Her Honour rejected an argument advanced on behalf of Coulter that considerations of parity between Ganene Coulter and Coralie Coulter arose. There is no challenge to that finding.

The grounds of the applications

Coulter

56The only ground sought to be relied on in support of Coulter's application for leave to appeal against sentence is that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

57The written submissions cited the relevant factual findings made by Latham J as follows:

"" The appellant 'was integral to the contract with Mr Brooks, in the sense that she provided the bulk of the deposit that initiated the killing' ... At no stage did [Coulter] 'attempt to persuade [Helen Ryan] that there were other lawful measures that were available to her'. However, 'she was not the instigator of the plot and apart from providing money, she played no direct role in the negotiations with Mr Brooks that led up to the killing' ...

 There was no remorse or contrition.

 The appellant 'personally had no motive for harming the victim'.

 The appellant was 72 years old at the date of sentencing, a person of good character without prior convictions.

 The appellant was a 'devoted and selfless mother and grandmother' ...

 'Helen Ryan's claims in respect of the assaults upon her by her husband, and his general behaviour towards her and towards their daughter, were grossly exaggerated, no doubt in order to convince her mother, Coralie Coulter ... that drastic action was needed to ensure their safety'.

 [Coulter's] participation in the offence 'can be explained ... by her genuine belief that her daughter and granddaughter were being subjected to gross physical and possibly sexual abuse' by the victim ... She accepted 'without reservation the claims made by Helen Ryan to the effect that both she and CR were being terrorised by the victim'.

 There were special circumstances justifying a variation in the usual ratio between non-parole period and [full]term.""

58No additional oral argument was advanced in support of the written submissions. In my opinion, no case has been made that the sentence was manifestly excessive. That Coulter had ""personally no motive for harming"" Jeffrey Ryan is, in my opinion, a significant finding, but one that, far from mitigating the offence, exposes it as one of considerable callousness, as her Honour regarded it.

59As is obvious from the Remarks on Sentence, the cold blooded and calculating nature of the offence makes it a very serious one indeed, as does the sustained period of planning, preparation and organisation.

60I am satisfied that the sentence was not manifestly excessive. I would grant leave to Coulter to appeal against the sentence, but dismiss the appeal.

Ryan

61As finally presented, Helen Ryan's application for leave to appeal against sentence pleaded five grounds as follows:

""1. The sentence was manifestly excessive.

2. Her Honour erred in departing from the standard non-parole period by increasing the non-parole period to 27 years.

3. Her Honour erred in finding that the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation 'remained guarded'.

4. Her Honour paid insufficient attention to the mitigating factors enumerated in s 21A(3)(e) to (h) [of the Sentencing Procedure Act].

5. Her Honour erred in not adequately disclosing her reasons for increasing the non-parole period from 20 years to 27 years.""

Grounds 1, 2, and 5: exceeding the standard non-parole period

62Part 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act deals with standard non-parole periods. For the purposes of the present application, the relevant provisions are as follows:

""54A What is the standard non-parole period?
(1) For the purposes of this Division, the standard non-parole period for an offence is the non-parole period set out opposite the offence in the Table to this Division.

(2) For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division.

54B Sentencing procedure
(1) This section applies when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence ... set out in the Table to this Division.

(2) When determining the sentence for the offence ... the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period.

(3) The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in section 21A.

(4) The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account.

(4A) ... 
(4B) ... 

(5) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate the sentence.""

63The Table to the Division (referred to in s 54A(1)) contains three references to offences of murder. Items 1A and 1B prescribe standard non-parole periods of 25 years for offences of murder where the victim of the murder was a member of a particular occupational group (such as police officer, emergency services worker, judicial officer, and a range of others), or other public official, exercising public or community functions and the offence arose because of the victim's occupation or voluntary work, or where the victim was a child under 18 years of age. In other cases of murder, the Table prescribes a standard non-parole of 20 years. This is the category into which Ryan's offence falls. Accordingly, pursuant to s 54B(2), Latham J was required, in determining the sentence for Ryan, to impose a non-parole period of 20 years unless she determined that there were reasons for setting a longer or shorter non-parole period.

64The only permissible reasons for departure from the standard non-parole period are those listed in s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act (s 54B(3)). That section sets out, in sub-s (2), factors that aggravate an offence, and, in sub-s (3), factors that mitigate an offence. However, by sub-s (1)(c), the Court is also required to take into account:

""any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence"",

and, for good measure, a suffix to sub-s (1) provides:

""The matters referred to in this subsection are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law.""

The effect of this is that all sentencing considerations are relevant to a determination under s 54B(2) to impose the prescribed standard non-parole period, or to depart from it, whether incrementally or decrementally. 

65In fixing a non-parole period of 27 years, Latham J imposed a term that was longer than the standard non-parole period by a considerable margin. Pursuant to s 54B(4) she was required to make a record of her reasons for doing so, and to identify each factor that she took into account.

66There is no discrete section in the Remarks on Sentence in which her Honour recorded her reasons for taking that course. In my opinion, s 54B(4) calls for a clear explanation of the reasons for imposing a non-parole period that exceeds the standard non-parole period, and for express identification of all relevant factors. However, by reason of sub-s (5), failure to comply with sub-s (4) does not invalidate the sentence. 

67Section 54A(2) should not be overlooked. It is clear that the standard non-parole period is intended to prescribe a non-parole period by reference to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of its type. It is perfectly clear, from the passages in the Remarks on Sentence that I have extracted above, that her Honour took the view that Ryan's offence was considerably more serious than an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. She said, explicitly, that the objective gravity was ""of a very high order"", and that the offence ""falls very close to the worst category for offences of this type"". 

68Also relevant, and touched upon, at least implicitly, in the Remarks on Sentence, were items (m) and (o) of the catalogue of aggravating factors set out in s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act - that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity, and was committed for financial gain. These were among the circumstances that took the offence close to a worst category offence.

69In support of these grounds, senior counsel for Ryan also referred to statistical material provided by the Judicial Commission of NSW. The limitations of such material were recognised. These, it was contended, showed that, between 2005 and 2012, the average sentence for murder was a head sentence of 25 years, with a non-parole period of 18 years. Where the murder was a contract killing, the statistics suggested a head sentence of 26.32 years, with a non-parole of 23.02 years; where the victim was the spouse of the offender, the average head sentence was 23.57 years, with a non-parole of 18.12 years. 

70What was lacking in the analysis was any reference to the circumstances of individual cases. It is to be borne in mind that her Honour considered that this was a case which only marginally fell short of being in the worst category of offences of its type - for which Ryan would have been liable for a penalty of imprisonment for life.

71The sentence does represent a considerable increment upon the standard non-parole period; however, that is commensurate with the gravity of the offence. 

72To the extent that ground 1 incorporates a challenge to the head sentence as well as the non-parole period, I observe that that sentence is proportionate to the non-parole period. It is also proportionate to the gravity of the crime.

73I would reject grounds 1 and 2 of the application; with respect to ground 5, I am satisfied that the Remarks read as a whole adequately disclose her Honour's reasons for increasing the standard non-parole period as she did.

Ground 3: prospects of rehabilitation

74I recognise that there is some apparent tension between the finding, in [35], that Ryan's prospects of rehabilitation ""remain guarded"" and her Honour's earlier expressed view, in [17], that there did not appear to be a compelling need to protect the community from Ryan, that the offence was ""a gross aberration"", and that there was no reason to think that Ryan represents an ongoing danger to the community at large. However, examination of the contexts in which these observations were made dispels any notion of inconsistency.

75The former finding ([35]) was made on the basis of the complete absence of any evidence of remorse or contrition. It was also made in the context of her Honour's consideration of a variation of the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence (see s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act). It is plain that, in expressing that view, her Honour was rejecting a submission for variation from that proportion, with a view to providing Ryan with an extended period of supervision while on parole. The latter finding ([17]) was made in the context of consideration of the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment, with implicit reference to s 61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. 

76In the absence of any acknowledgement by Ryan of her guilt of the offence, it was legitimate, in that context, to find that her prospects of rehabilitation were guarded. Even if it were not so, the prospects of rehabilitation would not be a sufficient reason to depart from the inevitable consequences of the finding that the offence came very close to a worst category offence. The submissions with respect to this ground focussed heavily on Ryan's previous good character and the absence of any criminal history. In this respect they overlapped with ground 4, with which I deal below. I merely note, for the purposes of this ground, that absence of criminal history does not necessarily bespeak prospects of rehabilitation. That Ryan could even contemplate a crime of the magnitude of the murder she organised suggests an absence of moral character.

77I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 4

78By ground 4, complaint is made that her Honour paid insufficient attention to certain mitigating factors spelled out in s 21A(3). Those to which reference was made are:

""(e) the offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions,
(f) the offender was a person of good character,
(g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend,
(h) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of the offender's age or otherwise,
...""

Her Honour recognised explicitly that Ryan had no criminal record. There was no evidence that she was otherwise a person of good character. I have dealt with the likelihood (or otherwise) of re-offending, and prospects of rehabilitation.

79In my opinion, her Honour dealt adequately with all of these factors. I would reject this ground of appeal.

80I would grant leave to appeal against the sentence, but dismiss the appeal.

81The orders I propose are:

Helen Ryan:

(i) Leave granted to appeal against sentence;

(ii) Appeal dismissed.

Coralie Coulter:

(i) Appeal against conviction dismissed;

(ii) Leave granted to appeal against sentence;

(iii) Appeal against sentence dismissed.

82Since preparing the above reasons, I have read in draft the dissenting judgment of Harrison J. I have considered the matters that he raises, and I accept that the age of Coulter, and her more limited involvement in the offence, are significant matters which could have resulted in a sentence more lenient than that imposed. However, it is fundamental that assessment of sentence is a matter for the primary sentencing judge, and a sentence so imposed is not to be interfered with unless it is shown to have been manifestly excessive, or, put another way, one which was not open in all of the circumstances. In this case, I am not able to be so satisfied. I agree that the sentence was severe, but, in my opinion, not manifestly excessively so.

83PRICE J: I agree with Simpson J.

84HARRISON J: I agree with Simpson J that the application by Ms Ryan for leave to appeal against her sentence should be granted but that the appeal should be dismissed. I also agree that Ms Coulter's appeal against her conviction should be dismissed. I consider that Ms Coulter's application for leave to appeal against her sentence should be granted but I am unable to agree that her appeal against that sentence should be dismissed.

85As the trial judge correctly observed, Ms Coulter was at the time of her conviction 72 years of age and of previous good character without prior convictions. She was described as a devoted and selfless mother and grandmother. She was not the instigator of the plot and apart from providing money, played no direct role in the negotiations with the person hired to commit the murder. Her Honour noted that Ms Coulter's participation in the offence could be explained, but not excused, by a genuine belief that her daughter and granddaughter were being subjected to gross physical and possibly sexual abuse by the deceased and that Ms Coulter accepted her daughter's claims to the effect that both her daughter and her granddaughter were being terrorised by him. On the other hand, she took no steps to dissuade her daughter from proceeding with the plan to kill the deceased or to direct her towards appropriate legal ways of dealing with her problems with him. Ms Coulter expressed no remorse or contrition for what had occurred.

86It is unnecessary for present purposes to refer in detail to the authorities dealing with the sentencing of offenders of advanced years. Even though the prospect of spending the last years of one's life in custody is likely, if not certain, to make the experience significantly more onerous and difficult, the requirement to impose what is a proper sentence in all of the circumstances remains an important consideration.

87In R v Ceniccola [2011] NSWSC 302 a 72 year old male offender was sentenced to a non-parole period for the violent murder of his elderly neighbour with a shotgun in the context of a dispute over a boundary fence that separated their rural properties. The offence was premeditated and planned and the offender never once expressed or exhibited any remorse for his actions. The shooting occurred on the deceased's property directly outside his kitchen in which the deceased's wife, to the knowledge of the offender, was huddled and in fear for her own safety. Paragraphs [47] - [49] of the remarks on sentence in that case are as follows:

""[47] I regard the offender's age and health as being of particular weight when determining an appropriate non-parole period for this offence relative to the standard non-parole period although a meaningful assessment of the precise nature and extent of the offender's health, compared to any similarly aged male member of the community, suffers from the absence of evidence directed specifically to that issue. So far as his age is concerned, Allen J in Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 at 507 commented relevantly as follows: 

""It simply is not the law that it never can be appropriate to impose a minimum term which will have the effect, because of the advanced aged of the offender, that he well may spend the whole of his remaining life in custody. A helpful review of the relevant authorities is contained in Braham (1994) 73 A Crim R 353. It is submitted for the applicant that Angel J was correct, in that case, in stating (at 369): 'Where advanced age is a factor justifying significant leniency - and the learned sentencing judge so held in fixing the disproportionate head sentences he did - ex necessitate considerations of ... proportionality of sentencing are irrelevant and the case is an inappropriate vehicle to give voice to general deterrence - as opposed to personal deterrence or deterrence to others of a like age.' 

I would not accept, however, that any of those considerations is irrelevant when sentencing a person of advanced age who, albeit generally in good health, has a statistically short expectation of life. Of course, account must be taken of how much more onerous it will be for him to serve a gaol sentence than it would be if he were younger. That is material to the appropriate length of the full-time custody. It does not make proportionality irrelevant. Likewise, the effect of the sentence upon general deterrence is not irrelevant. What, however, is appropriate by way of full-time custody, viewed from the point of view of general deterrence, must be considered in the light of the impact upon public perception of a gaol sentence imposed upon a man of such advanced years upon whom the sentence would bear the more heavily because of his very age and the real risk that he will never walk free."" 

[48] In Barton v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 164 at [24], Giles JA, with whom Howie and Latham JJ agreed had this to say: 

""[24] In Goebel-McGregor v R [2006] NSWCCA 390 the applicant was found guilty of murder, and was sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period 15 years and a total term of 20 years. The sentence commenced when the applicant was aged 62. James J, with whom Hidden and Hislop JJ agreed, recorded at [126] the submission that the sentencing judge 'having decided that the offence did not call for a life sentence, had imposed a sentence which, having regard to the prisoner's age and life expectancy, was tantamount to a life sentence'. His Honour said of this: 

'128 As regards the further submission made by counsel for the appellant, it is true that this Court has said that, if a life sentence is to be imposed, it should be imposed ""frankly and directly"" and a sentencing court which refrains from imposing a life sentence should not impose a determinate sentence which would have the effect of a life sentence. R v Chen (2003) 138 A Crim R 433 at 444 (67). However, a sentence must reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and when the offender is of advanced years a determinate sentence, in order to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, may unavoidably extend for all or most of the offender's life expectancy. In Des Rosiers v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 16 Latham J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, referred with approval at par 30 of her judgment to a statement by Allen J in R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502 at 507... 

129 In the present case the appellant was sixty-two years old at the time he committed the offence of murder by what the sentencing judge found to be a cowardly and brutal act. It was inevitable that there would be a real risk of the appellant dying in custody, before he completed serving even the non-parole period of any sentence which adequately reflected the objective seriousness of the offence'."" 

[49] The age of the offender means that a custodial sentence appropriate in all the circumstances for the murder of the deceased will be likely to see him still in custody at the end of his life. There is no certainty of that but the actuarial probabilities and common experience suggest that it is so. I am bound to take that fact into account but not in a way that derogates from the obligation of a sentencing judge to impose a sentence that adequately reflects the objective seriousness of the offence. The advanced age of the offender is a matter I take into account when determining whether to reduce the standard non-parole period of 20 years and whether or not to vary the statutory ratio of the non-parole and parole periods."" 

88In my opinion a head sentence of 27 years with a non-parole period of 18 years for Ms Coulter is an undoubtedly stern and severe sentence. It has been imposed upon an offender who contributed in a calculated and cynical way to the death of an innocent man. I agree in all respects with the sentencing judge's characterisation of the crime. However, I am unable to agree that a non-parole period of imprisonment of 18 years for a 72 year old woman in the particular circumstances of this case is not manifestly excessive. Although there is no evidence upon which to make an accurate assessment about it, common experience suggests that the applicant's age makes it at least likely, if not highly likely, that she will not survive to be released on parole in accordance with the sentence that has been imposed, or that she is likely to be severely diminished both mentally and physically if she does. That fact alone raises the prospect that the traditional and important concepts such as rehabilitation, protection of the community, specific deterrence and the risk of re-offending, as well as the exercise of a discretion to vary the statutory ratio, all acquire a wholly artificial, if not entirely meaningless, character in the context of cases such as this. Whilst I accept that it is necessary to impose a sentence in this case that meets the expectations of the community for general deterrence, punishment and retribution, it is my view that the sentence imposed is nevertheless manifestly excessive and that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.

89I would propose the following orders:

1. Dismiss the appeal against conviction.

2. Grant leave to appeal against sentence and allow the appeal.

3. Quash the sentence imposed by Latham J on 21 October 2011 and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years commencing on 10 February 2010 expiring on 9 February 2024 with a balance of term of 6 years commencing on 10 February 2024 expiring on 9 February 2030.

		29 July 2013",2013-07-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706398,Gotsis v R [2013] NSWCCA 184,"JUDGMENT 

1BEAZLEY P: The Court is in a position to give judgment. I will ask Price J to give the first judgment. 

2PRICE J: The applicant was sentenced by Blanch J (the Chief Judge) in the District Court to a total effective sentence of 9 years imprisonment with an effective non-parole period of 5 years following pleas of guilty to three offences of aggravated break enter and steal contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900 and one offence of assault with intent to rob in circumstances of aggravation contrary to s 95(1) Crimes Act. On each of the offences of aggravated break enter and steal there were further offences of aggravated detain for advantage contrary to s 86(2) Crimes Act placed on separate Form 1 documents which were taken into account on sentence pursuant to s 32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 

3At the time of the imposition of the sentence by the Chief Judge the applicant was serving a sentence with a full term of 10 years and an effective non-parole period of 7 years which had been imposed by Zahra DCJ on 15 February 2008. The effective non-parole period for this sentence would expire on 29 November 2014 and the full term on 
29 November 2017. The Chief Judge commenced the sentence that he imposed partly concurrent to the existing sentence by commencing the sentence on 30 November 2013. The earliest date that the applicant is eligible for parole is 29 November 2018 and the sentence is to expire on 29 November 2022. Accordingly, the total effective sentence being served by the applicant is 15 years with an effective non-parole period of 11 years. 

4The Chief Judge said in his remarks on sentence that the applicant had been given a combined discount of 50 per cent for assistance to authorities and for his pleas of guilty.

5In Ground 1 of the appeal, the applicant contends that in applying the discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas and the applicant's assistance, the Chief Judge did not give full effect to the discount of 50 per cent that he had specified. The applicant submits that from the Chief Judge's sentencing remarks his Honour intended to afford a discount of 5 years from the non-parole period but in reality had afforded a 4 year discount as part of the discount was achieved by way of 12 months partial accumulation with the sentence imposed by Zahra DCJ. 

6I find no error in the Chief Judge's approach to the application of the discount of 50 per cent which was quantified by his Honour as a discount of 4 years that was entirely for the offer of assistance, and a discount of 1 year for the pleas of guilty. The total discount of 5 years is consistent with being 50 per cent of the period the applicant would otherwise have served as the Chief Judge imposed a total non-parole period of 5 years. The concurrency of the sentence of 12 months benefited the applicant as the increase in the effective non-parole period is confined to 4 years and the mandatory period of imprisonment is effectively reduced. I would reject Ground 1 of the appeal.

7In Ground 2 of the appeal, the applicant contends that in determining the issue of totality, the Chief Judge erred in failing to provide a greater degree of concurrency between the sentence he imposed and the sentence imposed by Zahra DCJ in order to give proper effect to the discount for assistance to the authorities. The applicant submits that in the light of the minimal overlap between the two sentences of 1 year, the Chief Judge did not take the applicant's assistance into account in any meaningful way, if at all, in assessing the issue of totality in respect of the total sentence. 

8In Ground 3 of the appeal, the applicant contends that the Chief Judge erred in concluding that there was no basis for finding the existence of special circumstances, except based upon the accumulation of sentences. The Court's attention was drawn to the Chief Judge's remarks (ROS 18): 

""I have found special circumstances in relation to the individual sentences and insofar as the overall sentence is concerned, I am conscious of the fact that the overall period is only just less than the statutory ratio but in this case I see no reason for there to be a longer period of supervision than the four years provided.""

9The applicant argues that the ratio between the effective head sentence and the effective non-parole period was 73.3 per cent and this minimal departure from the statutory ratio does not take into account the fact that the applicant would be required to spend his time in custody in more onerous conditions. 

10In oral submissions, the applicant argued that in order to give effect to the 50 per cent discount the Chief Judge was required to commence the concurrency of the sentences earlier in time or to find special circumstances. It was submitted that his Honour failed to take into account the effect that the assistance would have in his serving an overall sentence. Grounds 2 and 3 were said to be related. The applicant also relied on R v Allan John Quinn [2005] VSCA 100. 

11I do not accept these submissions. The circumstances in Quinn were different to the considerations before the Chief Judge. The combined discount of 50 per cent and the concurrency of sentence of 12 months adequately reflected the pleas of guilty and the level of assistance provided. The extent of the partial accumulation was open to the Chief Judge in the exercise of his sentencing discretion. 

12Special circumstances having been found, the size of an adjustment to the statutory ratio, is essentially within a sentencing judge's discretion. The Chief Judge was aware that the adjustment was only slightly less than the statutory ratio. Furthermore, his Honour had considered the conditions under which the applicant would serve his sentence and had made allowance for that in the sentence. I conclude that the Chief Judge's finding of special circumstances and the adjustment of the statutory ratio was well within his sentencing discretion. I would reject Grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal. 

13In Ground 4 of the appeal, the applicant contends that the overall sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. The applicant points to the Chief Judge's findings of the applicant's remorse, and his capacity to rehabilitate himself. The applicant submits that a ""crushing sentence"" was imposed. 

14The Chief Judge characterised the offences as falling ""well above the mid range of seriousness"" (ROS 11). His Honour said (ROS 11):

""They are all very serious offences, involving the terrorising of people in their own homes, some of the victims being older people, but all of them being terrified in the circumstances that they found themselves in. They are offences that call for punishment that reflects strongly the principles of general deterrence as well as individual deterrence.""

15I agree with the Chief Judge's characterisation of the offences. It is plain that his Honour carefully considered the applicant's subjective case and the principle of totality before imposing sentence. The applicant has not shown that the overall sentence was unreasonable or plainly unjust. It is not manifestly excessive. I would reject Ground 4 of the appeal. 

16Accordingly I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed. 

17BEAZLEYP: I agree with the reasons of Price J and with the orders he proposes. 

18JOHNSON J: I also agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Price J. As a member of this Court in Shaw v R [2010] NSWCCA 23, where the Victorian decision in R v Quinn [2005] VSCA 100 was applied, I wish to add a number of observations to place in context that decision. 

19In my view, nothing said by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Quinn, nor this Court in Shaw, is of assistance to the applicant. In the present appeal, the applicant had not provided any assistance to the authorities prior to being sentenced by Zahra DCJ on 15 February 2008. His assistance commenced some time after then, and before being sentenced by Blanch J on 5 July 2011. The applicant's position is quite different to those considered in Quinn and Shaw, where assistance was provided by each offender prior to the sentence imposed first in time. That is not this case. 

20No error has been demonstrated by the applicant. However, even if some error had been demonstrated (and it has not), for the purpose of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, I would have readily formed the view that no lesser sentence was warranted in any event for the most serious crimes for which the applicant was sentenced on 5 July 2011. 

21BEAZLEY P: I will just record my agreement with the additional remarks of Johnson J. 

22PRICE J: I also agree with the additional remarks of Johnson J. 

23BEAZLEY P: Accordingly, the orders of the Court are:

1. Leave to appeal granted.
2. Appeal dismissed.

		07 August 2013",2013-07-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706407,R v Ravindran [2013] NSWSC 1006,"JUDGMENT 

1The accused has been arraigned on the charge of murdering his father and is standing trial commencing today. 

2By notice of motion lodged with my Chambers on Friday 19th July 2013, the accused applied for leave to make application for trial by judge alone. Section 132A Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) requires the grant of the Court's leave before an application for trial by judge alone made less than 28 days before the date fixed for trial may be entertained. 

3In support of the application, and the application for leave, the accused read the affidavit of his solicitor, Peter Morris Murphy sworn on 19th July. The solicitor attached to his affidavit the signed and witnessed statement of the accused confirming that he wishes to be tried judge alone, sitting without a jury, and acknowledging that he has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from his counsel, Mr. Stephen Russell and Mr. David Randle. He confirms that he understands the advice received and, as I understand paragraph 4 of his statement, that with the benefit of that advice he has made his own free choice to make the application.

4Mr. Murphy has also attached a notice of consent signed on behalf of the Crown by the Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor, Mr. Terrance Thorpe, who is prosecuting the accused. The learned Crown states that the prosecution does not oppose the grant of leave and ""agrees to the accused being tried by judge alone"".

5In the body of his affidavit, Mr. Murphy swears that the cause of death of the deceased will be a critical issue in the proceedings. This is consistent with my own knowledge of the case, from my involvement in the management of the case since March of this year.

6From Mr. Murphy's affidavit, and from what I have been told at various directions hearings, I understand that Professor Stephen Cordner, Director of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine was qualified as long ago as May 2012 to provide an opinion for the preparation of the defence. There have been significant delays in obtaining Professor Cordner's report for various reasons, which have been previously explained by the defence, none of which, in my view, relate to a lack of proper forensic diligence on the part of the accused or his legal representatives.

7Mr. Murphy says, consistently with what I was told at the directions hearing on the morning of 15th July 2013, that Professor Cordner's report was finally received that afternoon. 

8Following receipt of the report, counsel tendered advice and the accused provided instructions for leave to be sought to enable the application to be made. 

9In my judgment the delay in the receipt of Professor Cordner's report provides a satisfactory explanation for the delay in making the present application. Its receipt was necessary for the completion of the defence preparations. Without it, I infer, it would have been difficult for counsel to provide accurate, reliable advice to the accused about which mode of trial was appropriate for his case.

10Accordingly, I granted leave for the application for trial by judge alone to be made late.

11By dint of s.132(2) of the Act, once leave to make the application is granted, the Court must make a trial by judge order if the accused and the prosecutor agree to trial by judge alone. In such circumstance the Act of Parliament allows the judge no discretion. Subject to s.132(6), that is the present case. As I accept the contents of the statement of the accused of 18th July 2013, I am satisfied that he has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of a trial by judge order from an Australian legal practitioner, and accordingly s132(6) is no bar to the making of a trial by judge order.

12I am of the view that s132(5) does not alter this legal outcome, as it only applies in a case to which s132(4) also applies. And that provision comes into play only when the prosecution does not agree to trial by judge alone.

13In all these circumstances, the necessary statutory conditions being satisfied, I am bound in law to accede to the application.

14For these reasons I made orders in chambers on 19th July 2013 in the following terms:

On the application of the accused, by and with consent of Terrance Thorpe Esq., Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor, on behalf of her Majesty, the Queen, and on the grounds set out in the affidavit of Peter Maurice Murphy, Esq., solicitor, sworn on 19th July 2013, the Court orders:

(1)Pursuant to s.132A Criminal Procedure Act 1986, grant the accused leave to apply for trial by judge alone;

(2)Pursuant to s.132 of the said Act, the accused be tried for murder, commencing on 29th July 2013, by a judge alone without a jury.

		30 July 2013",2013-07-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706418,Gray v R [2013] NSWCCA 169,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ: I agree the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Fullerton J.
2FULLERTON J: I have read the draft judgment circulated by Campbell J.  I agree that the appeal should be dismissed but prefer to express my own reasons for coming to that view.
3The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed in the District Court on 16 December 2010 after pleas of guilty were entered in the Local Court on 28 September 2010 to eight offences (each of which attracted a discount of 25 per cent).  Two further offences were taken into account on the Form 1.
4The offences on indictment comprised six counts of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (""Crimes Act"") for which a maximum penalty of 20 years is provided, and two counts of taking and driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act which, by operation of s 117 of that Act, attract a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment.  
5The offences on the Form 1 included a further armed robbery and take and drive conveyance committed within the same time frame as the offences on the indictment.  Those offences were said by the sentencing judge to have been taken into account in the imposition of sentence on the first count of armed robbery.  I note that the same sentence was imposed on that count as was imposed on each of the remaining five counts of armed robbery.  Since there is no Crown appeal, the fact that his Honour's approach to dealing with the Form 1 offences would appear to be contrary to the principles applied in Attorney-General's Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146; 137 A Crim R 180 (most recently endorsed in Abbas v R [2013] NSWCCA 115) does not arise.
6The applicant was on parole at the time of the offending the subject of the sentence under challenge.  On 27 May 2004 he was sentenced in the District Court to a term of imprisonment of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years for armed robbery in a sentencing exercise which involved the imposition of fixed terms of imprisonment for three further offences of armed robbery.  He was released to parole on 16 January 2009.  Following his arrest on 24 September 2009 his parole was revoked.  He was serving the balance of parole at the time of sentence.
7On each of the first three counts of armed robbery, committed respectively on 6, 9 and 10 September 2009, and after a finding of special circumstances, non-parole periods of 3 years were imposed with an additional term of 2 years, reflecting a variation in the statutory ratio to 66 per cent.  The sentence on each count was ordered to date from 16 December 2009, his Honour having accepted that were the sentence to commence at the expiration of the parole period in March 2012 it would be ""crushing"".  
8On each of the remaining counts of armed robbery, committed respectively on 14, 18 and 20 September 2009, and also following a finding of special circumstances, non-parole periods of 3 years with an additional term of 2 years were also imposed.  The sentence on each of these counts was ordered to date from 16 December 2012, by which date the applicant would have served the balance of parole.  
9Fixed terms of imprisonment of 1 year were imposed for the take and drive conveyance offences.  Given the structure of the sentencing order for the armed robbery offences, the sentencing judge considered that it was inappropriate to fix a non-parole period for the take and drive offences.  The fixed terms were ordered to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed on the first three armed robbery counts.  
10In the result, an effective sentence of 8 years was imposed which comprised a non-parole period of 6 years to expire on 15 December 2015 with an additional term of 2 years to expire on 15 December 2017.  The structure of the sentence preserved, or reinstated, the statutory ratio provided for under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act""). 
The ground of appeal 
11There is no challenge to any of the individual sentences or the way they were structured.  The sole ground of appeal concerns what is said to be the failure to give practical effect to the beneficial finding of special circumstances in the total effective sentence.  It was submitted that the reasons for sentence make it clear that his Honour intended that the finding of special circumstances, which disturbed the statutory ratio on the two sets of armed robbery offences, was also to be reflected in the structure of the total sentence since that finding was made, in large part, for the express purpose of affording the applicant the opportunity to attend a residential drug rehabilitation unit upon his release from custody, thereby fostering his ultimate reintegration into the community. 
The facts for sentencing purposes 
12An agreed statement of facts was tendered on sentence.  In light of the limited basis upon which the sentence is challenged the following summary of the facts upon which sentence was imposed is sufficient for present purposes.
Take and drive conveyance: 19 August 2009 
13The applicant entered a Volkswagen dealership at Five Dock and was observed by an employee to show an interest in a 2005 Touareg vehicle.  When approached the applicant asked to speak to the manager and appeared to follow the directions offered by an employee to that end.  He was later seen driving the vehicle from the premises.  It was recovered by police on 27 August 2009 in Glebe, a short distance from where the applicant was residing.
Take and drive conveyance:  1 September 2009
14The applicant entered the premises of a car repair business at Artarmon and removed keys to an Audi A6 which was parked outside.  He gained entry to the car and drove it from the premises.  It was recovered by police on 12 September 2009, again a short distance from where the applicant was residing.
Armed robbery:  6 September 2009
15The applicant entered the Subway fast food outlet at Ultimo at about 3.50pm where three employees and two customers were threatened, first with a bread knife the applicant grabbed from the counter and then with a knife he removed from his jacket.  The applicant demanded they surrender their wallets.  One of the customers handed over his wallet containing $50 in Australian currency and some Indian currency.  The applicant ran from the store and left the scene in the stolen Audi.
Armed robbery:  9 September 2009
16The applicant entered the Australia Post Office in Rozelle at 11.57am where he threatened a postal officer with a knife demanding that he and his colleague open the safe.  He stole $1667 cash in total comprised of money from the safe, together with $100 from the service counter and a purse belonging to a customer which contained a further $100 cash.


Armed robbery:  10 September 2009
17The applicant entered the Australia Post Office at Artarmon at 2pm where he threatened a postal officer with a knife demanding money.  He stole $835 from one cash register operated by an employee, a further $740 from another cash register operated by a second employee and $40 from a third cash register.  The robbery was witnessed by a customer. 
Armed robbery:  14 September 2009
18The applicant re-entered the Australia Post Office at Artarmon at 3.42pm.  On this occasion he removed a knife from his clothing demanding money from the same three officers who had been the subject of the robbery four days earlier.  A total of $1100 in cash was stolen.
Armed robbery:  18 September 2009
19The applicant entered a newsagency at Gladesville and, whilst armed with a knife, threatened the shop assistant before taking a total of $1200 in cash.  A customer entered the store during the course of the robbery.
Armed robbery:  20 September 2009
20The applicant entered the Subway fast food outlet at South Point Shopping Centre, Hillsdale.  Whilst armed with a knife he threatened a shop assistant before stealing $700 from the cash register.  An off-duty police officer witnessed the robbery and chased the applicant but was unable to arrest him.
The Form 1 offences
21The armed robbery offence the subject of the Form 1 was committed on 8 September 2009 and involved the applicant entering a pet store at Paddington and demanding money under the threat of a gun he claimed was in his pocket.  On that occasion he stole $600 in cash.  The vehicle the subject of the take and drive offence committed on 14 September 2009 was a Toyota Corolla that was being detailed at a car wash.  The car was located by police near the applicant's address.  On 23 September, following his arrest, the applicant was found in possession of the key to the Toyota taken on 14 September 2009. 
The applicant's criminal antecedents
22The applicant was aged 32 at the time of sentence.  He had a lengthy criminal record having been sentenced in the Local Court to imprisonment for multiple offences of break, enter and steal in 1996 and 1997, with non-custodial penalties imposed for offences of a similar kind both preceding that date and at various intervals thereafter.  He had also been sentenced to imprisonment in the District Court on successive occasions from 1999 for offences involving violence and robbery, of graduating seriousness, culminating in the sentences imposed in the District Court in May 2004.  As noted above, following his arrest in September 2009 for the subject offences he was returned to custody to serve the balance of the sentence imposed in May 2004.  
23There is no challenge to his Honour's assessment of each of the offences as serious, or that they were aggravated by being committed while the applicant was subject to conditional liberty on parole.  Although his Honour did not refer specifically to whether and, if so, how the applicant's criminal record impacted on sentence (see R v Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109 at [42]) he did refer to the need to have regard to the protection of the community in the imposition of sentence which, given the extent and length of the applicant's criminal history, was a consideration in the sentencing exercise which necessarily carried significant weight.  


The applicant's subjective circumstances  
24The applicant tendered a report from Ms Nasr, forensic psychologist, and a discharge summary from the manager of ""The Peppers"", a residential drug rehabilitation service where the applicant spent three months following his release to parole in January 2009.  The applicant's father gave evidence.  
25His Honour made a number of factual findings drawn from this evidence which had a direct and material bearing on whether the applicant was capable of being rehabilitated which, in turn, impacted on his finding of special circumstances. 
26The applicant had a fractured family life after his parents separated when he was six, largely as a result of his mother's alcoholism and her mental illness.  He has no relationship with his mother.  His father remarried during the applicant's early adolescence but that family unit was also punctuated by frequent arguments as a result of which the applicant left the family home.  During this period the applicant commenced his association with illicit drugs which developed over his late teens and into adulthood into a drug dependence with heroin as his drug of choice.  He had learning and behavioural difficulties during his schooling where he was assessed as developmentally disabled.  Upon leaving school he obtained an apprenticeship as a spray painter which he did not complete. 
27On psychometric testing by Ms Nasr the applicant's intelligence was assessed as falling into the extremely low range with his performance being above only 0.2 per cent of the normative sample commensurate with a person with a mild intellectual disability.  She identified a long history of depressed mood characterised by an intense sense of helplessness and hopelessness which together with a range of risk factors, including chronic drug abuse, impulsivity and vulnerability to peer pressure, have shaped the applicant's developmental trajectory where almost his entire adult life has been spent in a custodial environment.  In her view, the applicant has become institutionalised to such an extent that he is lacking many of the basic coping and independent living skills that are required for mature and stable community living.  He has twice tried to take his own life whilst in custody and has been bullied by other inmates as a result of his disability.  Despite being offered programs catering to his specific needs whilst in custody in the past, he did not obtain any lasting benefit. 
28The applicant's active participation in the various programs offered at The Peppers on his release to parole in January 2009, and his family support and the support of his Probation and Parole officer at that time and upon his release from that treatment program in April 2009, did result in his gaining employment and secure accommodation.  Regrettably, however, this was short lived when, after suffering a fracture to his wrist in a football game, some months later the applicant lost his job and ultimately returned to Sydney where he reconnected with a drug milieu in the context of which he reoffended.  
29Ms Nasr's report was extensive.  His Honour referred to her remarks in summation, with which he wholly agreed, in the following passage: In sum, this is a sad case of a vulnerable, disadvantaged and intellectually disabled man, who has been institutionalised, with limited experience of adaptive functioning within the community.  As such, [the applicant] will require a high level of supervision, coordinated support and comprehensive intervention if he is to be able to make a meaningful transition to the community and lead an offence-free life.  Without this, his prognosis is poor.
30His Honour was ultimately satisfied that the applicant was capable of being rehabilitated and that his attitude to his rehabilitation was encouraging.  His Honour noted that the applicant asked that he be housed in the Developmentally Disabled Unit at the Long Bay Correctional Centre as a sentenced prisoner.  A recommendation was made to that effect.  His Honour also identified the applicant's need for rehabilitation in the community on his ultimate release from custody as one of two bases upon which he found special circumstances, the other reason being his intention that some of the sentences to be imposed would be partially accumulated.
The applicant's submissions on the appeal 
31On the appeal the applicant's counsel acknowledged that were his Honour to have limited his finding of special circumstances to the fact that the number and range of offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced would inevitably attract an order for partial accumulation, and that the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term on the individual counts required adjustment for that reason, then the preservation of the statutory ratio after accumulation would not have been indicative of error.  However, as counsel sought to emphasise, the finding of special circumstances was not made solely because of the need for partial accumulation but, additionally and importantly, because of his Honour's favorable finding as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation.  Despite the applicant's lengthy criminal record and his breach of parole three months after his release from custody, counsel submitted that the evidence supported that finding and, when considered in the context of the applicant's compromised intellectual functioning, should have been reflected in a more beneficial sentencing outcome by a modest reduction in the total non-parole period in favour of an extension of the time under close supervision on parole. 
32Whether through oversight or a failure to comply with the principled approach to sentence mandated by the High Court in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610, counsel submitted that the ultimate sentencing order did not achieve that result and that this Court should move to re-sentence. 
33The error of principle upon which counsel relied was said to be evidenced in one part of his Honour's exchange with the Crown and the applicant's solicitor in the sentencing hearing in the following extract:  Well I suppose what I could do I could lump three, the first three together and then partially accumulate on top of those for the next three.  I think that's the only way in which I can sensibly deal with it.  It's a bit of a fiction but I think it will comply with the spirit of Pearce, and it will also comply with what you would like as some acknowledgement of accumulation because of the different offences.
34Counsel submitted that this extract revealed that the sentencing judge had effectively settled on a non-parole period of 3 years for each of the two sets of armed robbery offences, instead of considering the sentence to be imposed for each offence (or set of offences) and only then turning to consider the ratio of the non-parole period to additional term referable to the operation to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (again both for each offence or set of offences) and then, after the order for partial accumulation, undertaking that same exercise.  This error in approach was said to have either masked the error in the sentencing result or explained it, or both.  
35It is an uncontroversial statement of sentencing principle that where a sentence of imprisonment is to be imposed it ought not be inflated to accommodate a finding of special circumstances.  It is also well settled that, subject to the operation of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, sentences for multiple offences are to be imposed consistent with the approach mandated in Pearce.  In my view, there is nothing in the above extract, or in the frank exchanges with counsel that preceded and followed it, that suggested an error of either kind.  To the contrary.  In what was a difficult and delicate sentencing exercise his Honour referred more than once to the need to comply with Pearce - an approach which finds eloquent expression in his sentencing remarks.
36The question that remains to be considered is whether the applicant has made good the contention that his Honour intended that the finding of special circumstances should translate into a reduction in the overall non-parole period but, by inadvertence, did carry his intentions into effect.  A related question is whether this Court should move to re-sentence to correct that error were it found established. 
37Counsel referred to a number of cases where this Court has intervened and re-sentenced in what were said to be like circumstances: Thorpe v R [2010] NSWCCA 261; R v Argent [2004] NSWCCA 270; R v Sharrock [1999] NSWCCA 289; R v Thornbury [2000] NSWCCA 526; R v Keen [2004] NSWCCA 86; R v Street [2005] NSWCCA 139; R v LWP [2003] NSWCCA 215.  
38In the last mentioned case, said to be analogous to this case, the sentencing judge structured each of a number of individual sentences so as to reflect a finding of special circumstances on the basis of the offender's rehabilitation.  In each case, the non-parole period was 66 per cent of the sentence.  However, when the sentences were accumulated, the statutory ratio of 75 per cent under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was preserved.  This Court was satisfied that the sentencing judge had intended to give effect to his finding of special circumstances in the total sentence imposed, and that his sentencing discretion has miscarried for that reason.  Importantly, the Court was also ultimately satisfied that, in accordance with s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), a less effective sentence was warranted in law and re-sentenced the applicant to carry the sentencing judge's intention into effect. 
39Counsel accepted that even were we satisfied that his Honour did intend a variation in the ratio between non-parole period and additional term in the effective sentence, we would need to be satisfied that a lesser effective sentence was warranted at law.  I do not understand that on re-sentence any alteration in the total effective sentence is sought.  Rather, what was proposed was that the ratio of 66 per cent be applied to the total sentence (that is, the ratio that is applied to the sentences for both two sets of armed robbery offences) which would result in a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months.
40The applicant's counsel also placed particular reliance upon the observations of Simpson J in Thorpe where her Honour said at [4]:...Where the basis for a finding of special circumstances is to foster rehabilitation, it is the overall term, not the terms of individual sentences, that must be adjusted. If that is not the result, the finding of special circumstances is ineffective to achieve its objective. The applicant is entitled to the benefit of that finding in a practical, not merely theoretical, way.
41Her Honour's views were expressed in the context of the complexities of the case under consideration which involved a review of two sentencing exercises before different judges of the District Court, and where the sentence under appeal, the subject of the second sentence proceeding, was committed prior to the offences the subject of the earlier proceeding.  I do not interpret her Honour to have intended to express that in every case where individual sentences have been accumulated and special circumstances have been found on the basis of the need to provide for an offender's rehabilitation, a variation in the ratio in the overall term will inevitably result.  As I see it, the question in any particular case is whether a finding of special circumstances has been effectively translated into the sentencing outcome in a ""practical, not merely theoretical, way"" by providing for a parole period that allows for an adequate period under supervision in the community which remains proportionate to the non-parole period as the mandatory period an offender is to serve in custody without inappropriate emphasis on that mandatory period.
42While there is no fixed criterion referable to which a finding of special circumstances under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act might be made, the need for the structure of a sentence to reflect a favourable finding as to an offender's prospects of rehabilitation, and the corresponding need to foster rehabilitation as a recognised sentencing objective, is commonly invoked.  The fact of accumulation across a number of separate sentences is also invoked in order to accommodate and reflect the principle of totality (see the observations of Simpson J in Kalache v R [2011] NSWCCA 210 at [20] and the remarks of Allsop P at [2] and Buddin J at [45] as to the significance of the operation of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in promoting rehabilitation as an important part of the sentencing exercise).  
43In this case, I acknowledge that the sentencing judge specifically found that both rehabilitation and aggregation warranted a finding of special circumstances.  I also note that when his Honour appointed the expiration dates of both the effective non-parole period and the total effective sentence in the sentencing order, he stated that he had ""not complied with the 75/25 per cent ratio"" when, in fact, the statutory ratio was applied.  This lends some support for the applicant's claim that it was through inadvertence that the statutory ratio in the overall sentence was not varied.  However, as the Crown emphasised in submissions and, in my view, not without significance, the sentencing reasons in this case were delivered ex tempore.  It is not suggested by the Crown that there is any lack of order or structure in his Honour's sentencing remarks.  It was submitted, however, that the precision in expression or refinement which might be incorporated into a sentencing judgment delivered after the luxury of time to prepare it may explain why his Honour stated in his sentencing reasons that he had not complied with the statutory ratio when, in a robust exchange with counsel in the sentencing hearing that immediately preceded the pronouncement of the sentencing order, he made it clear to the parties that he intended that the minimum period the applicant should spend in custody was 6 years.  
44At one point in the exchange with counsel, which in my view accurately reflects his Honour's intention which he carried into effect in the sentencing order, he said:...about six years, on the bottom I'm talking about, expire about six years away.  That's the sort of figure I'm thinking about.  I think it reflects, it does three things, it reflects the seriousness of the offence, (2) it's going to give him the opportunity within the prison system hopefully of re-adjusting his mindset and thinking.  And number (3), it's going to in that period of time protect the community from - that's the sort of figure I've got in mind and any more would be crushing, any much less would be - would not reflect the criminality.
45For my part, I am not persuaded that the error the applicant contends for has been made out.  While it is true that the progressive accumulation of the two sets of sentences for the six armed robbery had the effect of restoring the statutory proportion between non-parole period and additional term to the aggregate sentence, and whilst that might on one view of the cases to which we were referred be an unusual result, I am not satisfied that it was an unintended result.  To the contrary.  I am satisfied that his Honour's very favourable findings as to the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were not only reflected in the structure applied to the individual armed robbery offences but, in addition, they were also fairly reflected in the 2 year parole period applied to the aggregate sentence.  This structure had the ultimate effect of not only addressing principles of totality, it also left the non-parole period of 6 years to reflect the serious criminality comprehended by each of the eight offences the subject of sentence, each of which was aggravated by being committed whilst the applicant was on parole.  
46CAMPBELL J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence passed upon him by his Honour Judge Solomon in the District Court of New South Wales on 16th December 2010. He was sentenced for six armed robbery offences and two offences of taking and driving a car without the consent of the owner. Two additional offences were taken into account in sentencing for the first armed robbery offence, occurring on 6 September 2009, on a Form 1. These were a further armed robbery and a further taking and driving a car.
47The sentencing judge imposed an effective sentence of eight years imprisonment, consisting of a non-parole period of six years and an additional term of two years.  
48The offending occurred in what might be regarded as a one-man crime wave between 19th August and 14th September 2009. The applicant was then on parole for previous offences, including a number of armed robberies, being part of a sentence imposed on him by the District Court on the 27th of May 2004. 
49His offending was related to his heroin addiction. The applicant pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity.
Grounds of appeal
50In the appeal papers the applicant advanced one ground:
The sentencing judge erred by failing to give practical effect to his finding of special circumstances in the context of the total effective sentence to be served by the applicant.
But, in oral argument an additional challenge was mounted on the basis of ""Pearce error"".  
The structure of the sentences
51The sentencing judge imposed sentences in the following terms (reasons pp 8 - 9).
As to the take and drive offence of 19 August, 2009 and take and drive conveyance offence of 1 September 2009, Christopher Kevin Gray you are convicted, sentenced to imprisonment for one year to date from 16 December 2009 to expire on 15 December 2010. I decline to set a non-parole period for the reason of the structure of the sentences imposed makes it inappropriate to do so (sic).
Christopher Kevin Gray, in respect of the armed robbery offences of 6 September 2009, 9 September 2009, 10 September, 2009 you are convicted. The offender is sentenced as follows, I set a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 16 December 2009, expiring on 15 December, 2012. I impose a further period of imprisonment of two years, commencing upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring 15 December 2014. The total sentence is therefore five years comprising a non-parole period and a balance of the sentence.
I find special circumstances. Eligible to be considered for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. The Form 1 is taken into account when I sentenced the offender in respect to the offence of 6 September, 2009.
Christopher Kevin Gray in respect of the offences of robbery of 14 September, 2009, 18 September, 2009 and 20 September, 2009 you are convicted. The offender is sentenced as follows, I set a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing 16 December, 2012 and expiring on 15 December 2015. I impose a further period of imprisonment of two years to commence upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring 15 December 2017. Total sentence is therefore five years, comprising a non-parole and the balance of the sentence. I find special circumstances. Eligible to be considered to release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.
The effect of that Mr Gray is that you will be eligible for release to parole on 15th December 2015.
The applicant's 2009 parole
52The applicant had been released to parole under the 2004 sentence on 16th January 2009. Upon his release he was admitted to a residential drug and alcohol treatment centre. He ""completed"" his treatment episode - perhaps terminated may be a better word - on 16th April 2010, with the approval of the Probation and Parole Service (Exhibit 2). Regrettably, he must have relapsed into drug use soon thereafter for he was returned to custody on 18th May 2009. The reason for this is not clear on the evidence. He was released to parole again on 24th July 2009, and after only one month the current spate of drug related offending began. He was arrested for the current offences on 25th September 2009 and the parole authority again revoked his parole. He became liable to serve the balance of his parole, a period of 2 years, 5 months and 17 days, expiring on 11th March 2012.
53In this regard, the Crown argues, with justification, the sentencing judge's partial accumulation of the first sentences imposed by him from 16th December 2009, antedating their imposition by twelve months, was lenient.  


The nature of the offending
54The armed robbery counts were laid under s 97(1), and the ""car stealing"" offences under s 154A(1)(a), of the Crimes Act.  Each armed robbery offence carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment; the ""car stealing"", five years. Neither offence is a standard non-parole period offence. That the series of offences occurred in breach of the applicant's parole provides significant context to his offending.
55The facts may be adequately summarised as follows. I have drawn upon the sentencing judge's reasons and the Crown's written submissions:
(a)The first offence was a take and drive conveyance committed on 19th August 2009. An employee of a Volkswagen dealership at Five Dock noticed the applicant looking at a 2005 model VW Toerag. When questioned the applicant asked to speak to the manager and then seemed to follow the directions offered by the employee. A short time later he returned to the car and drove off when no one was looking.  It was recovered on 27th August 2009, a short distance from the applicant's accommodation at Glebe;
(b)The second take and drive conveyance was committed on 1st September 2009. At about 6 p.m. on 1st September 2009, apparently undetected, the applicant entered the upstairs office of Atlas Bodyworks of Artarmon and removed the keys to an Audi A6, which was parked outside in a secured state.  He gained entry to the car with the key and drove off in it. It was not recovered until 12th September 2009, again in Glebe.  
(c)The applicant committed the first four offences of armed robbery on the 6th, 8th, 9th and 10th of September 2009 at Ultimo, Paddington, Rozelle and Artarmon respectively. The Paddington offence, committed on two staff members of a pet shop and involving $600, was dealt with on the Form 1 appurtenant to the first armed robbery count. It is not without significance that after committing this offence he made good his escape in the stolen Audi. The offence on the first count was committed at a Subway fast food outlet at Ultimo. Three employees and two customers were threatened with a knife. The proceeds of the crime were modest indeed. The next armed robbery occurred at the Rozelle post office. Two employees and one customer were threatened with a knife and $1667 in cash was stolen. The fourth armed robbery (third count) occurred at the Artarmon post office. Three employees and one customer were threatened with a knife and $1615 was stolen.
(d)The armed robberies committed on the 14th, 18th and 20th of September (counts four, five and six) were also dealt with together by the sentencing judge. On 14th September 2009 the applicant committed a third car stealing offence, dealt with on the Form 1. He stole a Toyota Corolla car from a car rental company at Artarmon. Soon thereafter he robbed the Artarmon post office a second time, armed with a knife. He jumped the counter threatening the same three employees with his knife. He stole $1100 and escaped in the stolen car.
(e)Police located the stolen car the following day at Glebe. The officers kept it under surveillance. They approached the applicant as he entered the car, but he escaped by driving off at speed.  
(f)On 18th September 2009 the applicant robbed the Monash Park Newsagency at Gladesville. Again, he jumped the counter threatening one employee and one customer with a knife. He stole $1200.
(g)The final offence was committed on 20th September 2009 at a Subway fast food outlet at Hillsdale. The applicant threatened one employee with a knife and stole $700. An off duty police officer gave chase, unsuccessfully.
56The applicant was arrested on 25th September 2009 at Glebe, in possession of the keys for the Corolla.
57The learned trial judge properly regarded the consideration that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of the commission of the offences as an aggravating factor. As the Crown points out, his Honour might also have had regard to the fact that each offence was part of a planned criminal activity and that the victims, particularly the post office and shop employees, were vulnerable.
58Moreover, the applicant has a lengthy criminal record including prior offences of a similar nature. These extend to ten car stealing offences between 1995 and 1998, seven other stealing offences over approximately the same period, breach of recognisance in 1996, revocation of parole in 2000, and five offences of either robbery or armed robbery. These last matters are the offences already mentioned for which he was sentenced in 2004, and in respect of which he breached his parole by committing the present offences. He has served numerous short terms of imprisonment over the years, as well as a term of 2 years (non-parole period of 18 months) imposed by the Sydney District Court on 4th October 2001. The 2004 sentence involved an effective term of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.
The applicant's subjective case
59The sentencing judge acknowledged the early plea and allowed a discount of 25 per cent for its utilitarian value. His Honour accepted also that the plea indicated a degree of contrition, and he accepted the views of Ms. Rima Nasr, a psychologist whose report is Exhibit 1, that the applicant was remorseful and understood the consequences of his actions upon his victims.
60The applicant was born on 23 April 1978. He was accordingly 31 years old at the time of the offences, and 32 when sentenced. His parents separated when he was six. He then lived with his father, and did not bond with his stepmother upon his father's remarriage.
61He had learning and behavioural difficulties at school where he was assessed as developmentally disabled. Ms. Nasr, through psychometric testing, assessed the applicant's intelligence as falling into ""the extremely low range, with his performance [on the tests] being above only 0.2 per cent of a normative sample"". Ms. Nasr expressed the view that the psychometric results were commensurate with a person with a Mild Intellectual Disability. She recorded that the applicant received little by way of formal schooling and has difficulty with literacy and numeracy.
62The applicant used to absent himself from home for days at a time. The sentencing judge found that he left home permanently at an early age. He obtained an apprenticeship as a spray painter but did not persist with it.
63After leaving home he fell into the way of using illicit drugs. He first used heroin at the age of nineteen and quickly developed a dependence on the substance. Heroin had remained his drug of choice.
64He twice tried to take his own life whilst in custody and had been bullied by other inmates because of his slowness.  
65According Ms. Nasr, when previously in correctional facilities he had been assessed as ""developmentally disabled"" and underwent programs catering to his particular needs. He did not obtain lasting benefit from his participation. As I have recounted, he received some initial benefit from the residential rehabilitation program he had undertaken upon his release to parole in January 2009. He relapsed after a wrist injury interfered with his work and other prospects.  
Reasons for sentence
66The sentence was passed ex tempore immediately following the completion of the proceedings on sentence. During those proceedings, it is fair to say, the learned sentencing judge engaged in a very open discussion with counsel appearing for the applicant and the Crown about the nature of the case, and what his Honour then had in mind fixing as the appropriate sentences for each offence for this offender. What is said in argument is no substitute for reasons. I record this only because it was part of the argument advanced in this Court that the nature of the procedure adopted by his Honour may in part explain what the applicant says are the errors in his approach. It is not necessary to use the exchanges between the sentencing judge and counsel to supplement his Honour's reasons, which in any event, were clear and comprehensive enough.
67His Honour did not make specific reference to the applicant's long criminal history.  But as I have said, he emphasised that the current spate of offences were committed whilst on parole. His Honour cannot have overlooked the other aspects of the applicant's record because he considered the protection of the community was a salient consideration in the sentencing task before him. In this regard, his Honour clearly had in mind Veen [No. 2] v The Queen [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 476 - 7. I infer that he kept in mind that this consideration is subject to the principle of proportionality.
68Moreover, as he drew upon the evidence of the applicant's father, and of Ms. Nasr (with whose evidence he expressed complete agreement) when considering the applicant's subjective circumstances, it may be taken that he considered that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced by reason of the diagnosis of a Mild Intellectual Disability. Likewise, the significance of general deterrence. His Honour, I think appropriately, found it unnecessary to refer to these objects of sentencing specifically.
69Given the number of offences with which he had to deal, his Honour had ""regard to the totality principle"", and was well aware of the requirements of ""the principles contained in Pearce's case"" (Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 623 [45] - 624 [48]).   
70His Honour ""totally agree[d]"" with Ms. Nasr's conclusion, which was in the following terms (Exhibit 1 at [47]):
In sum, this is a sad case of a vulnerable, disadvantaged and intellectually disabled man, who has been institutionalised, with limited experience of adaptive functioning within the community. As such, Mr Gray will require high level of supervision, coordinated support and comprehensive intervention if he is able to make a meaningful transition to the community and lead an offence-free life. Without this, his prognosis is poor.
71His Honour said (reasons pp. 6 - 7)
As to the offender's present incarceration he is in a Limited Association classification, which means he spends some twenty-three hours per day in his cell and is allowed one hour per day out of his cell for exercise. The offender's interest in rehabilitation is pleasing and I do find special circumstances for the reason that the offender requires rehabilitation in the community on his release from custody. I further find special circumstances for the reason that it is my intention to accumulate some of the sentences. [Emphasis added].
72The sentencing judge then outlined the sentences he proposed to impose and, following his reference to Pearce's case, he ""note[d]"" that he was not complying with the statutory ratio in s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, at least in respect of the individual sentences he was imposing. His Honour said he was taking into account the Form 1 offences in dealing with the armed robbery offence of 6 September 2009.
73His Honour made particular reference to the fact that both the Crown and counsel for the applicant submitted that the sentences should not be crushing. His Honour made clear that he had designed the structure of the sentences he was about to impose with that in mind.
74His Honour then imposed the sentences set out above. His Honour recommended that the applicant be transferred to the Developmentally Disabled Unit at Long Bay and that a copy of Ms Nasr's report be provided to Justice Health (as soon as practicable).
75I interpolate that it is clear, at least to my mind, that: back-dating the commencement of the sentences for twelve months, so they were accumulated leniently on the balance of term yet to be served for the previous sentence; ""batching"" the six armed robbery offences into groups of three; accumulating the concurrent sentences so produced for each group upon the expiration of the non-parole period for the first; and extending the statutory ratio for the individual sentences, but not the effective sentence, were all measures that his Honour took to comply with the sentencing legislation, and the general law principles relating to sentencing, including Pearce.
Submissions of the parties
76Ms A. Francis of counsel, who appeared for the applicant, argued that the preservation of the statutory ratio in the total effective sentence betrayed an error of principle. In particular reliance was placed upon the dictum of Simpson J in Thorpe at [4]:
Where the basis for a finding of special circumstances is to foster rehabilitation, it is the overall term, not the terms of individual sentences, that must be adjusted. If that is not the result, the finding of special circumstances is ineffective to achieve its objective. The applicant is entitled to the benefit of that finding in a practical, not merely theoretical, way.
Ms Francis referred to other cases where the failure to give proper effect to a finding of special circumstances warranted re-sentencing on appeal.
77Learned counsel also argued, although no ground, nor written submission, had been filed in support, that the learned sentencing judge had offended Pearce by omitting to fix the total sentence for each offence first, and then considering concurrency, accumulation and totality, before adjusting the non-parole period by increasing the statutory ratio to give effect to the finding of special circumstances in the final result.
78The Crown reminded the Court that the sentencing judge was obliged to take into account the requirements of the guideline judgment which calls for consideration of a stern sentencing range: R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346.  The Crown argued that his Honour was correct that a lesser non-parole period would not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offending. The breach of parole, and the rejection by the offender of the opportunity it provides for rehabilitation, is regarded very seriously: R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [15]; R v Cicekdag [2004] NSWCCA 357; 150 A Crim R 299. It was a legitimate exercise of the discretion for the judge to find special circumstances when minimum terms are accumulated for the purpose of preserving the statutory ration in the effective term:  R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58 at [61].
79In any event, even if the Court was satisfied of the applicant's arguments as to error, the Crown submitted that no lesser sentence was warranted in law.
Resolution
80As frequently occurs in sentencing matters, in the circumstances of a particular case, the relevant considerations may overlap, and ""guideposts to the appropriate sentence [may] sometimes ... point in different directions"": Veen [No. 2] at 476. In my judgment, that has occurred in this case. It is true enough that the learned sentencing judge found special circumstances partly on the basis of the applicant's need for rehabilitation in the community on his release from custody. This consideration may lead to a sentencing judge increasing the statutory ratio provided for by s44(2) for the total effective sentence, but not necessarily. In simple terms the period of two years provided for that purpose by the structure of the sentence imposed here is a long time for community based supervision. Nor will the need for extended supervision necessarily lead to a reduction in the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in custody. It should not be overlooked that the non-parole period constitutes ""the minium time that a judge determines justice requires that [the offender] must serve having regard to all the circumstances of his offence"": Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 629; Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18; 169 CLR 525 at 536.
81In any event, the consideration that points in the opposite direction to the finding based on the need for rehabilitation in the present case is the finding that the need to accumulate the sentence itself constituted special circumstances. That such a consideration may constitute special circumstances is clearly established: R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 at 121, 136 per Badgery-Parker J; R v Simpson at 60 per Hunt CJ at CL.  At 61 in the latter case, Hunt CJ (Grove and Sharp JJ agreeing) added:
I am satisfied that, by a logical extension of that principle, special circumstances may also exist in an appropriate case where a court is imposing a series of cumulative sentences, so that it can ensure a proper proportion between the total minimum term and the effective additional term - even if it is only to produce an effective additional term equal to, or roughly equivalent to, one-third of the total term which the prisoner is to serve.
Moffitt and Simpson, of course, were decisions under s 5 of the former Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW). That legislation was to the same legal effect as ss 44(1)-(2) of the current legislation: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at 190 [108] - [113]. In the circumstances his Honour was entitled to reconcile the competing claims of rehabilitation and accumulation as he did.
82Having regard to the applicant's very long criminal history, as well as the objective seriousness of the one-man crime wave instituted by him over the period of about one month in August - September 2009, involving ten offences (two on a Form 1) whilst he was on parole for a previous spate of robberies, some of them whilst armed, his Honour's conclusion that the principal object of sentencing for which he had to provide was the protection of the community, subject, of course, to the principles of totality and proportionality, was amply justified. In my view the considerations of proportionality and totality are not offended by the sentence imposed. I would reject this ground of appeal.
83As I understood the additional ground advanced orally, it was that the well known passage in Pearce cited above, because of the finding of special circumstances by a reference to the need for rehabilitation, necessitated the sentencing judge first fixing the total effective term of imprisonment, and working from there to produce an overall result that increased the statutory ratio favourably to the applicant.  This would have had the effect of reducing the minimum period the applicant would be required to serve.  I would reject this argument also.
84The present case does not provide any occasion for a close analysis of the principles expounded in the well-known passage from Pearce cited above.  Suffice it to say, subject to the provisions of the sentencing legislation (Pearce at 624 at [47]), a sentencing judge is required to first ""fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation and concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality"".  With respect, that is exactly the process followed by the sentencing judge in the present case, and I can detect no error in his approach based on Pearce.  
85Section 44(1) is expressed in terms that ""the court is first required to set a non-parole period"".  However, it is well established that the statutory language does not itself dictate a sequence to be followed in fixing an appropriate sentence. In Moffitt at 117 - 8 Samuels JA expressed the idea that provisions of this type do not ""lay down an intellectual sequence of any kind by which the sentencing judge's reasoning was to be rigorously ordered in every case"".  His Honour said:
In my opinion... there is nothing ... which compels theview that the court must in every case first determine a minimum term which, once selected, is immutable; so that a sentencing judge who in the course of the reasons for sentence has postulated a minimum term and calculated the additional term which the statute would require, has made some irrefragable order. On the contrary, I would have thought that it would be appropriate practice for the court first to consider the range within which an appropriate minimum might lie, having considered, at least in a general way, the relevant factors, and then to look at the linked range of additional terms which would ordinarily follow. 
Badgery-Parker J (at 134) said:
What [the section] does is to prescribe that a sentence must be composed of a minimum term and an additional term and that when it comes to the actual imposition of sentence, the sentence must be expressed as comprising first a minimum term and then an additional term; but the section does not necessarily require that the judge apply his mind first to the minimum term and secondly to the additional term.
(Section 45, of course, in the circumstances to which it applies, permits a   court to decline to set a non-parole period).  
86In R v Hampton (1998) 44 NSWLR 729 at 732 Spigelman CJ pointed out that the legislation neither required ""a sequential two-step process"" nor the giving of primary consideration to the total sentence. As ""general sentencing principles guide all relevant steps in the [sentencing] process... [t]he two approaches may go on simultaneously"" (citations omitted).  In my opinion the approach contended for by the applicant is required by neither Pearce nor the sentencing legislation.
87I would only wish to add that I do not understand his Honour's recommendation that the applicant receive treatment whilst in prison as offending the principle discussed in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 139 - 40 [57].
Conclusion
88I am not of the opinion that another sentence is warranted in law.  Accordingly, the orders I propose are:
1. Grant Leave to Appeal;
 2. Appeal dismissed.

2706442,Williams v R [2013] NSWCCA 168,"Judgment

1THE COURT: Chad David Williams makes application for an extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon him by O'Connor DCJ on 6 March 2008 for his part in an attempted contract killing, which attracted a charge under s 27 of the Crimes Act 1900 of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder, to which he pleaded guilty. 

2On sentencing he asked that a further offence of malicious damage by fire, contrary to s 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act be taken into account on a Form 1. That offence involved the destruction of a vehicle which was owned by the victim of the offence on indictment. The vehicle was valued at $42,000.

3The maximum penalty for the s 27 offence was 25 years imprisonment and there was also a standard non-parole period of 10 years imposed by s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The maximum penalty for the s 195 offence was 10 years. 

4The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years, comprising a non-parole period of 7 years with a balance of term of 3 years. The sentence reflected a discount of 45 per cent for his early plea and assistance.

5The sole ground of appeal advanced by the applicant is that he has a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of the disparity with the sentence imposed on a co-offender, Ms Louizos.

6Ms Louizos, who was charged with soliciting to murder under s 26 of the Crimes Act, was convicted by a jury at a trial at which the applicant gave evidence. That offence also carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. On 25 September 2008, Ms Louizos was sentenced by Woods DCJ to a term of imprisonment of 10 years, comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 4 years.

7The Crown appealed that sentence and Ms Louizos appealed her conviction. Her appeal was dismissed on 20 March 2009, but the Crown appeal was upheld, her sentence having been found to be manifestly inadequate. Ms Louizos was re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 13 years and 6 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 10 years and a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months (see Louizos v R [2009] NSWCCA 71; (2009) 194 A Crim R 223). It is the alleged disparity with this sentence which the applicant now seeks to rely on.

Extension of time

8The Crown opposed the grant of leave extending the time to permit the application for leave to appeal to be brought, given the delay of five years between sentence and the filing of the application, the circumstances in which his application came to be made and the basis upon which it was advanced. 

9For the applicant it was argued that there was no prejudice in leave being granted and the Crown could not be heard to complain about delay. This was said to be because the Crown had always known of the sentence imposed on Ms Louizos, but had neither informed the applicant of the jury verdict, obtained in part as the result of his assistance, or the sentence that was imposed after trial or on re-sentence following the successful Crown appeal. Reliance was placed on R v Tan (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 11 March 2004, Unreported), where Allen J, with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Blanch J agreed, had observed:

""In its joint judgment in Lian this Court expressed concern that the re-sentencing of him disturbed the relativity of his sentence to the sentences imposed upon Han and the present appellant respectively. The Court indicated that each of them should be informed of the outcome of Lian's appeal so that he might make his own application if so advised. The perceived error in the sentencing approach which had been adopted by Finlay J was common to the sentencing of all three of the offenders.""

10While it was accepted that the Crown had no obligation to inform an offender of the sentence imposed on another offender, it was said to be relevant to the application for an extension of time that the Crown had not informed the applicant of these matters. 

11Those submissions are rejected.

12To the extent that this Court needs to enquire into why a differently constituted Court, which heard Ms Louizos' appeal, did not take the approach of yet another differently constituted court in Tan where the Court was dealing with a quite unique set of facts, or why the Crown did not take a similar approach, of its own volition, the reasons are, it seems to us, obvious. 

13Firstly, unlike the situation in Tan where there was an identifiable sentencing error common to all three offenders, the error which resulted in Ms Louizos being re-sentenced was particular to her sentence, being one of manifest inadequacy. 

14Secondly, and a critical point of distinction as we see it, is that the sentence imposed upon Ms Louizos on re-sentence was not only fixed by reference to the nature and seriousness of her offending, but also as the result of the ameliorating effect on re-sentence of the principle of double jeopardy (s 68A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 not having any application at the time of her sentence).

15The delay in bringing this appeal was addressed in two affidavits. In his affidavit, the applicant said that he had understood that if he wanted to appeal his sentence, he had to do so within 28 days of sentence being imposed. Ms Louizos had not been tried at the expiration of that period and he said he did not understand that there was, or might be, any significance in her sentence compared to his. It was not until February 2013, after he was notified by Legal Aid that his case had been reviewed, and after he was given advice that he should apply for legal aid for an appeal against the severity of his sentence, that he learned of Ms Louizos' sentence and, after receiving further advice, instructed his solicitor to lodge an application for leave to appeal.

16In an affidavit sworn by Ms Fernando, a solicitor employed by Legal Aid, it was revealed that the challenge to the applicant' sentence was the result of his case having been reviewed as part of Legal Aid's response to the decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. While no Muldrock error was found, the review was said to raise the potential for a parity argument. After receipt of counsel's advice, parity was the only ground for the application for leave to appeal filed in May 2013. 

17While that explains why the application for leave to appeal against sentence was lodged almost five years after sentence, it does not automatically follow that leave to extend the time for bringing the appeal should be granted. A similar situation to the present case was recently considered in Lowe v R [2013] NSWCCA 141 where Davies J, with whom Price J and Barr AJ agreed, observed at [99]:

""In my opinion where this Court determined the co-offender's appeal also based partly on parity on 15 April 2011, where there is no satisfactory explanation for the delay for most of the period, where the appeal has apparently only been triggered by contact from Legal Aid because the case was thought to involve a Muldrock point but where there was a disavowal of reliance on Muldrock at the hearing of the appeal, where the outcome of the appeal will not result in an alteration to the overall sentence, and having regard to the public interest in the avoidance of delay in bringing appeals to this Court, the application for the extension of time to appeal should be refused.""

18For reasons which follow, it seems to us that the same conclusion must be reached in this case.

19It was also common ground on the appeal that the merits of the application for leave to appeal against the sentence must be considered in determining whether leave should be granted (see for example Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 and Flack v R [2011] NSWCCA 167). Again, for the reasons that follow, having considered the merits of the application we are fortified in the view that leave should be refused.

The applicant's sentence

20There were four offenders involved in the attempted murder of Barry Bruce in February 2006: the applicant, Ms Louizos, Mr Denning and Mr Moys. Mr Bruce was Ms Louizos' ex-partner, with whom she was involved in a custody dispute. It was Ms Louizos who recruited the applicant, who in turn recruited Mr Denning to carry out the murder and Mr Moys to drive a getaway vehicle. (The disposition of the proceedings against Mr Moys was not the subject of comment on the appeal.)

21It was known to the applicant that Mr Denning, then a 19-year-old who suffered from a mild intellectual disability, had been the victim of sexual abuse as a child and as a consequence, had a hatred of paedophiles. The applicant told Mr Denning, falsely, that Mr Bruce was a paedophile who had sexually abused his partner, when she was aged between 7 and 14 years. It was accepted that while Mr Denning was offered some money for his part in the offence, he would not have been involved, had he not been provided with this false information.

22There was evidence of planning over some two weeks prior to the attempted killing. It was the applicant who provided Mr Denning with a large knife and a disguise and the applicant and Mr Denning who waited for Mr Bruce in his driveway in the early hours of the morning. When he got out of his Land Cruiser, to move bins which they had placed in the driveway, Mr Bruce was repeatedly stabbed by Mr Denning. He was left to die in a stormwater drain and his Land Cruiser was taken away, set alight and destroyed by fire.

23Mr Bruce was initially not expected to survive. He suffered nine stab wounds, four to his left shoulder and neck, three to his right shoulder/upper chest and two to his abdomen. His bowel was severed, causing it to protrude from his abdomen. He managed to raise the alarm at a neighbour's house and was taken to hospital in a critical condition, having lost 4.5 litres of blood. He had to wear a colostomy bag for a period and underwent numerous operations to rejoin his bowel, as well as operations on his shoulders, to regain mobility. At the time of the applicant's sentencing, further surgery was planned. Mr Bruce was unable to work and continued to suffer considerable pain in his shoulders, stomach and right hand, as well as suffering bleeding from the bowel.

24The applicant received a combined discount of 45 per cent for his assistance to authorities and his early plea. Fifteen per cent of that discount was for future assistance in agreeing to give evidence for the Crown at Ms Louizos' trial.

25The applicant was sentenced at the same time as Mr Denning. His Honour concluded that the applicant's culpability was greater than that of Mr Denning, notwithstanding that Mr Denning was the person who had actually inflicted the wounds. The applicant was found to have actively manipulated Mr Denning into committing the offence by providing false information, Mr Denning's intellectual disability having made him an easy target of such manipulation. Planning of the offence was found to have been more in the hands of the applicant, who recruited Mr Moys and Mr Denning and who directed Mr Denning, at the point at which Mr Bruce was actually attacked.

26The applicant gave evidence and a psychologist's report was also in evidence. His subjective circumstances were that he was then aged 27 years, the product of a supportive family. He had two siblings and retained the support of his parents. He had had a troubled relationship with his partner with whom he had four children, then aged between 7 and 18 months. The three older children had been removed from their care in 2003. They were with foster carers and their daughter was in the care of his former mother-in-law. He was separated from his partner and had not had contact with his children since being in custody.

27While at school he became involved with older people who introduced him to alcohol and drugs. He had had intermittent employment as a welder after he left school, but as a result of escalating drug and alcohol abuse he was unable to maintain employment. He had used cannabis, amphetamines and had been injecting ice since 2002. He had served a six-month sentence for offences of break, enter and steal, drive whilst disqualified and obtaining money by deception. After release from custody he had again become involved in drugs.

28He had eventually obtained secure employment at the Wyoming caravan park as a caretaker, where Ms Louizos was the manager. It was she who approached him about killing Mr Bruce, her former partner. He initially refused to find someone to kill her ex-partner, but agreed when she persisted, fearing that he would lose his job and the house he had access to at the park.

29His Honour took into account relevant aggravating factors, including the vulnerability of the victim and that the offence involved planning and organisation. He concluded that while the applicant claimed to be in fear of losing his job and his home, the anticipation of financial reward was part of his motivation for his offending. His Honour did not consider that the applicant had been acting under duress as a factor in mitigation, but accepted that he had shown genuine remorse. His Honour also considered that a combined discount of 45 per cent was appropriate to reflect the applicant's plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities.

30His Honour concluded that the applicant's offence was serious, observing that contract killings had long been regarded as falling into the worst category of murders. His offence, also committed under contract and involving an intention to kill, resulted in an unprovoked attack on a defenceless man, with a significant degree of ferocity evidenced by the serious life-threatening injuries inflicted on Mr Bruce, who was fortunate to have survived.

31His Honour considered that the offence was above the mid range of offences of this nature, falling midway between the midrange and the top of the range. The standard non-parole period was utilised as a benchmark or reference point. The offence on the Form 1, was also considered to be a serious offence, with the result that when sentencing for the offence on indictment, greater weight had to be given to personal deterrence and to the community's entitlement to exact retribution for serious offences.

32Special circumstances were also found, with the discretion given by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, exercised in the applicant's favour, justifying a departure from the statutory ratio. In the result, a non-parole period of 7 years with a balance of term of 3 years was imposed.

Ms Louizos

33In sentencing Ms Louizos the trial judge considered that the question of her motivation in soliciting the applicant and Mr Denning to kill her ex-partner was important, in that by the jury verdict and her evidence, it had to be assumed that it related to her children. Although there were Family Court proceedings on foot in relation to custody of the children at the time of the offence, his Honour was unable to find that her motive was to derail or pervert those proceedings. He also noted that, in any event, she had primary care for most of the children and significant access to the others. In the absence of any suggestion that she was the subject of domestic violence or that she stood to gain from her ex-partner's death, his Honour considered that her motivation remained ""obscure, even mysterious"". 

34His Honour concluded:

""Notwithstanding the objective seriousness of the offence, the absence of comprehensible motivation causes me to impose a lesser non-parole period than the standard non-parole period. In the range of offences involving soliciting to murder, there are commonly motivations involving the diversion of legal proceedings and financial gain. These are common ones. Love gone wrong is another. Hatred and revenge are other motives which do appear from time to time. In this case as I have said, it is difficult to discern a motivation but there are certainly worse motivations to crime than the desire to be with one's children, even if that desire provokes, as the jury found in this case it did, seriously wrong conduct.""

35His Honour also considered the sentences imposed on the applicant and Mr Denning, but considered they were not comparable for parity purposes, noting that they had both had a history of prior criminality and imprisonment. His Honour also considered that their motivations were different, the applicant's being material gain, including the entitlement to have use of a cottage on a continuing basis, and Mr Denning's because he sought to exact misplaced revenge or retribution believing Mr Bruce to be a paedophile and, for that reason, the sentences imposed upon them were not suitable for comparative purposes.

36Finally, his Honour also found special circumstances in Ms Louizos' case, with the result that her sentence also involved a departure from the statutory ratio imposed by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

37In upholding the Crown's appeal, Howie J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreed, concluded that the sentencing judge's discretion had miscarried as the result of a fundamental error in his approach to sentence in two related respects: firstly, that he had failed to determine the objective seriousness of Ms Louizos' offending and, secondly, that he had failed to give any consideration to the standard non-parole period in the sentencing exercise, in circumstances where Howie J considered her culpability was great and the objective seriousness of the offence significantly above the mid-range. On any view, Ms Louizos was criminally responsible for the injuries which were inflicted, a matter which needed to be reflected in her sentence, despite not being charged, as her co-offenders were, with inflicting those injuries. 

38Howie J went on to hold that if a sentencing court cannot determine what motivated an offender to commit an offence, motive was not a factor that could be taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of the offence and that it was not relevant in any other way to fixing the sentence to be imposed.

39As to the question of the applicant's motivation, he observed at [104]-[105]:

""104 Nor do I understand why the motivation of the appellant, however mysterious it might have been, in wanting to retain custody of her children was any less serious than that attributed to Williams in wanting to ensure a stable life so that he could persuade the authorities to return his children. Yet his Honour disregarded the sentence imposed upon Williams on the basis that his motive was apparent and he had a criminal record. But Williams was given the same sentence as the appellant and a greater non-parole period notwithstanding that he received a 45 per cent discount for assistance. Whatever be the extent and nature of Williams' criminal record, I do not understand how it could have justified such a disparity between the sentences imposed upon him and that imposed upon the appellant when her criminality was significantly greater than his.

105 Of course the purpose of a Crown appeal is not to redress disparity and I do not take into account the substantial disparity between the sentence imposed upon the appellant and that imposed upon her co-offenders in determining whether error has been shown or whether this Court should intervene. But the discrepancy is so great that it should have alerted his Honour to the possibility that his discretion had miscarried in relation to the sentence he intended to impose upon the appellant.""

40Before moving to re-sentence, his Honour said at [110]-[112]:

""110 Were I sentencing the appellant afresh and unconstrained by the fact that this is a Crown appeal, I would have imposed a non-parole period above the standard prescribed, because the objective seriousness of the offence was significantly greater than mid-range. This is notwithstanding the mitigating factors of her good character and prospects for rehabilitation. I would have considered a non-parole period of 13½ years with a balance of term of 4½ years the appropriate sentence. Having regard to the length of the balance of term there would be no reason to find special circumstances as the parole period would be adequate for her rehabilitation after release and there is no other reason to reduce the non-parole period. I do not believe that the simple fact that the appellant had prior good character itself justified a finding of special circumstances. Nor do I consider that the impact upon her of being separated from her children a reason to reduce the non-parole period. (emphasis added)

111 The appellant relied upon statistics derived from other sentences imposed for this offence. They are of very little, if any, significance. First, there are only 9 cases listed. Secondly, the statistics supplied to the Court do not discriminate between those cases where there were pleas of guilty. The least sentence imposed was two years and the highest 16 years. The non-parole periods imposed are remarkable given that there is a standard non-parole period of 10 years specified for the offence. Only one case received that sentence. One case received 6 years; this is probably the appellant's sentence. The rest received less than 3 years one being as low as 18 months. As is usually the case when consideration is given to statistics for offences where there is a standard non-parole period specified, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that courts are apparently paying little or no regard to the standard non-parole period. In any event, the appropriate sentence is determined by a proper application of the standard non-parole provisions regardless of what the statistics reveal. 

112 It should be apparent that in my opinion the sentence is manifestly inadequate to a very significant degree. It is less than half of what it should have been. Therefore, before this Court would exercise its discretion to refuse to intervene, there would need to be some matter of quite remarkable significance that would justify the Court staying its hand. There is not. A psychological report was tendered on this issue that reveals that the appellant is not dealing with custody well and it has affected her physical and mental health. That is unfortunate but it would be so whatever sentence the appellant was called upon to serve. The appellant's children are suffering but the dismissal of the appeal would hardly ameliorate that problem.""

41The 18 year sentence which his Honour considered ought to have been imposed on Ms Louizos at first instance to reflect the seriousness of her offending was not imposed on re-sentence because, as we noted earlier, at that time the principle of double jeopardy applied on re-sentencing after a successful Crown appeal. His Honour observed at [114]:

""As is normally the case in order to address to some degree the double jeopardy that attends a Crown appeal, the sentence I propose is less than I believe should have been imposed at first instance. It is the very least that can reflect the culpability of the appellant and address Parliament's intention by passing the provisions relating to the standard non-parole period. There are no special circumstances.""
(emphasis added)

42While his Honour's views reflect the fact that on re-sentence, a sentence of 13 years and 6 months, comprised of a non-parole period of 10 years and an additional term of 3 years and 6 months was appropriate, in our view it remained a most lenient sentence given the gravity of her offending.

Parity

43It was the sentence imposed on Ms Louizos by this Court which is said to offend the parity principle and which is said to leave the applicant with a justifiable sense of grievance, given that after application of a discount of 45 per cent he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years, comprised of a non-parole period of 7 years and a balance of term of 3 years such that, undiscounted, his head sentence was 18 years. Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that despite Ms Louizos' criminality as the person who solicited others to kill being greater than the applicant's and despite the gravity of his offending, the starting point for his sentence was significantly greater than hers thereby creating an unjust disparity. It was submitted that in light of the sentence finally imposed on Ms Louizos (who was not entitled to any discount), the starting point for his sentence should have been no higher than the 13 years 6 months term imposed upon her which, after applying the combined discount of 45 per cent to which he was entitled, would have resulted in a sentence of 7 years and 5 months.

44In our view, despite the difference in the sentences, the submission that the disparity attracts a justifiable sense of grievance should be rejected for the following reasons.

45While a maximum penalty of 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years applied to both the s 27 and s 26 offences, the offences for which the applicant and Ms Louizos were sentenced at first instance, and in Ms Louizos' case on re-sentence, were different, one being a solicit to murder, the other being the infliction of injury with murderous intent. 

46As Howie J discussed in Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [246]:

""The principle, whether it is called parity or proportionality or relativity between sentences, should be applied to bring about a just result in the sentences imposed upon persons who have been engaged in the same criminal enterprise regardless of the charges that have actually been laid against the offenders. However, I agree with Campbell JA that the principle is subject to the limits stated in [203] of his judgment."" [We do not consider the limitations to which Campbell JA referred to have any practical impact on the application of the principle of parity raised on this appeal.]

47For his part, Campbell JA said:

""[202] Even though there was no issue squarely raised in the cases mentioned in the previous paragraph except AAH & AAG, as there has been in this, of whether as a matter of principle the parity principle can apply between people who have not committed the self-same crime, it is not to be supposed that the large number of judges who proceeded in this way did so by oversight. As the facts of Sumner, Nguyen, Rend, Shen, OM and Melikian illustrate, unequal treatment that is so great as to bring about a justifiable sense of grievance can sometimes arise between participants in a common criminal enterprise who have committed different crimes. In my view there is no obstacle of the type the Crown submits to the parity principle being applied simply because a case is one in which the sentence by comparison with which the sentence under appeal is sought to be reduced was for a different crime. 

[203] There are significant limitations, however, on reducing a sentence on the basis of that of a co-offender who has committed a different crime. At least some of the limits on the use of the parity principle in such a case are: 

1. It cannot overcome those differences in sentence that arise from a prosecutorial decision about whether to charge a person at all, or with what crime to charge them: Howard; Wurramarbra; Formosa

2. If it is used to compare the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes, there can be significant practical difficulties. Those practical difficulties become greater the greater the difference between the crimes charged becomes, and can become so great that in the circumstances of a particular case a judge cannot apply it, or cannot see that there is any justifiable sense of grievance arising from the discrepancy: Gibson; Howard; Formosa

3. It cannot overcome differences in sentence that arise from one of the co-offenders having been given a sentence that is unjustifiably low: Armstrong; Diamond; Rexhaj; Isamundar

4. ...""

48That said, and despite the fact that the offences in this case arose from the same criminal enterprise, there remain some practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes (see Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462; 214 A Crim R 152 at [30]). However, that practical limitation does not exclude the operation of the parity principle in an appropriate case, although the effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case. 

49In addition, in this case it should not be overlooked that a serious offence was taken into account on the Form 1, when the applicant was sentenced. Contrary to the arguments advanced on his behalf in this Court, that offence, which carried a maximum penalty of 10 years, necessarily resulted in an increase in the sentence imposed from what would otherwise have been appropriate were he to be sentenced only for the s 27 offence (see Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at [42]). The law as it applied at the time of sentence was reviewed in Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115. As we see it, the Form 1 offence is an important point of distinction between the two offenders and, of itself, would not have warranted an undiscounted sentence of 13 years and 6 months as a starting point.

50It may be accepted that had the applicant complained about the disparity between his sentence and Ms Louizos' original sentence (and had his appeal been heard and determined before she was re-sentenced), an appeal based upon breach of the parity principle would likely have succeeded. However, after the successful Crown appeal against the inadequacy of her sentence, the position was materially different since the increase in her sentence, ameliorated significantly by the application of the principle of double jeopardy, operated to redress that disparity. It is also of significance that a complaint of disparity accepts that the sentence appealed from is otherwise appropriate (see England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [22]; Jimmy v R at [251].) 

51It is also well settled and, as we see it, critical to the disposition of this appeal, that a relevant difference between the situations of an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence and another offender with whom a comparison is sought to be drawn for the purposes of a parity argument may be that the sentence of the co-offender was the result of a successful Crown appeal (see El Hassan v R [2003] NSWCCA 252 at [13]; Bowtell v R [2004] NSWCCA 17 at [35]; Kauwenberghs v R [2008] NSWCCA 98; (2008) 186 A Crim R 197 at [109]). That is this case.

52As noted above, on re-sentence Howie J considered that the sentence initially imposed on Ms Louizos was less than half of what should have been imposed upon her at first instance. Extrapolating from his Honour's view, on re-sentencing, but for the impact of the double jeopardy principle, the starting point for her sentence would have been 18 years. It was only the application of the double jeopardy principle which resulted in a sentence of 13 years 6 months being imposed. 

53In our view it is this that stands in the way of the applicant succeeding in achieving a reduction in sentence to achieve parity with Ms Louizos' ultimate sentence. Again in Jimmy v R, Howie J said at [249]:

""I also confirm the obita view I expressed in Osman v R [2008] NSWCCA 157, with which McClelland CJ at CL agreed, that an applicant should not be able to seek parity with a sentence imposed upon a co-offender after a successful Crown appeal simply on the basis that the sentence imposed upon the co-offender was reduced because of double jeopardy or for some other discretionary reason that does not apply to the applicant.""

54In Osman v R [2008] NSWCCA 157, Howie J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed, referred to R v Christie [2000] NSWCCA 354, where Fitzgerald JA had held at [19]: 

""In this difficult area, the law yields logic to justice. An otherwise appropriate sentence imposed on an offender is reduced if that is necessary to ensure that he or she is not treated unjustly compared to a co-offender, even a co-offender to whom leniency has been extended, unless the co-offender's sentence is unsuitable as a basis for comparison because of manifest error. When comparison is legitimate, it is necessary for the Court to decide whether, after due allowance has been made for all material differences, the sentence of the offender seeking a reduction is so much more severe than the sentence imposed on the co-offender that the resulting disparity gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.""

55Howie J observed in Osman, at [37]-[38]:

""In that case [referring to Christie] there was no issue of parity arising because of the difference between the criminality of the applicant and the co-offender and the different subjective considerations, including a plea of guilty by the co-offender. It was held that, even taking into account that the co-offender was treated leniently because of the Crown appeal, there could be no justifiable sense of grievance held by the applicant in all of the circumstances of that case. 

It is unnecessary in order to resolve this matter to consider the issue of parity in relation to a sentence imposed by this Court following a Crown appeal where that sentence was less than it might otherwise have been because of the effect of double jeopardy. For my part, and with respect to the members of the Court in Christie, I have some difficulty understanding why an offender should receive a reduced sentence because of the effect of double jeopardy on a co-offender... ""

56In the result, we do not consider that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance, or that there is a breach of the objective of equal justice arising from the re-sentence of Ms Louizos, where she received a lenient sentence after a Crown appeal as a direct result of the operation of the principle of double jeopardy. In our view, the leniency of Ms Louizos' sentence by operation of law rendered her sentence unsuitable for comparative purposes.

57Further, assuming on re-sentence the applicant was entitled to a finding of special circumstances and the statutory ratio provided by s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was applied, a non-parole period in the order of 5 years and 7 months would result. 

58Given the nature and seriousness of the applicant's offending, a mandatory sentence of that duration would fail to reflect the nature and seriousness of the offences for which he was sentenced and would be productive of a sentence that would, in our view, be wholly inadequate.

59Finally, even if we were of the view that there was a relevant disparity in the sentences, which we are not, there is no obligation to reduce a sentence to one which is inadequate and for the reasons discussed above we would not in this case. In Green v R; Quinn v R, French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ observed at [33]:

""... the existence of a discretion, where unjustified disparity is shown, to reduce a co-offender's sentence to one which is inadequate does not amount to an obligation to do so... Whether or not the discretion to reduce a sentence to an inadequate level is available, marked and unjustified disparity may be mitigated by reduction of the sentence appealed against to a level which, although lower, is still within the range of appropriate sentences.""

60In Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227; 214 A Crim R 191 Bathurst CJ, James and Johnson JJ said at [82]:

""Where there is a degree of disparity so as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for this court to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective circumstances. This court will not necessarily intervene where the co-offender's sentence is so inadequate that the court should not take it into account: Lewins v R ; at [7]; Dwayhi at 280-281 [21].""

Orders

61For these reasons the application for extension of time to appeal is refused.

2706460,New South Wales Crime Commission v Meilak (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 936,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1By summons filed in July 2012 the New South Wales Crime Commission sought orders against the plaintiff under s 10A and s 12 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. The application was supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the Commission's Director (Financial Investigations). 

2Mr Spark there deposed to the basis of his suspicion that the defendant, Mr Meilak, had been engaged in serious crime related activities, namely the supply of a prohibited drug, cocaine contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. That belief rested in part on a police facts sheet, which disclosed the circumstances in which the defendant came to be arrested and charged with this offence.

3On 6 July 2012 restraining and other orders were made by Adamson J under s 10A as to the defendant's interest in certain property identified in a schedule to the order and under s 12 as to his examination.

4Today the Commission has filed a motion in Court, supported by an affidavit sworn by Ms Bourne, a forensic accountant employed by the Commission. The Commission seeks an order under s 12(1) of the Act for the examination of Edward Douehi in relation to the affairs of the defendant and the nature and location of property in which he has an interest. It asks that the motion be dealt with ex parte 

5Ms Bourne's affidavit discloses that the orders made by Adamson J remain in force and that in July 2012 the Commission also sought orders under s 27 of the Act, which provides:

""27 Making of proceeds assessment order
(1) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for a proceeds assessment order requiring a person to pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person that took place not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, whether or not any such activity is an activity on which the application is based as required by subsection (2) or (2A).
(2) The Supreme Court must make a proceeds assessment order if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person against whom the order is sought was, at any time not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, engaged in:
(a) a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity, or
(b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more.
(2A) The Supreme Court must make a proceeds assessment order against a person (other than an individual who is under the age of 18 years) if the Court finds it more probable than not that:
(a) the person derived proceeds from an illegal activity or illegal activities of another person, and
(b) the person knew or ought reasonably to have known that the proceeds were derived from an illegal activity or illegal activities of another person, and
(c) the other person was, at any time not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, engaged in:
(i) a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity, or
(ii) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more.
(2B), (2C) (Repealed)
(3) A finding of the Court for the purposes of subsection (2) or (2A) need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence or a finding as to any particular quantity involved, and can be based:
(a) on a finding that some offence or other constituting a serious crime related activity and punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more was committed, or
(b) on a finding that some offence or other constituting a serious crime related activity was committed involving some quantity or other that was an indictable quantity.
(4) The references in subsections (1) and (2) to a period of 6 years include a reference to a period that began before the commencement of this section.
(4A) The reference in subsection (2A) to a period of 6 years includes a reference to a period that began before the commencement of that subsection.
(5)-(12) (Repealed)""


6Ms Bourne deposed to the basis upon which she had come to the belief that Mr Doueihi has knowledge of the defendant's affairs and the location of property in which he has an interest. That includes a notice served in July 2012 under s 17 of the Act requiring the proper officer of Prisand Pty Ltd to attend and produce documents; documents produced in answer to that notice in August 2012, including documents as to the sale of three apartments at Waitara, which disclosed that Mr Doueihi was the sole director of Prisand; email correspondence with Mr Doueihi, which revealed that the defendant had an involvement in the development of that property; the results of searches conducted on ASIC databases; in terms which have been filed and the results of the defendant's examination on 23 May 2013, which confirmed a connection between he and Mr Doueihi and their involvement in his development of the Waitara property.

7In the circumstances disclosed in Ms Bourne's affidavit, I am satisfied that the motion should be dealt with ex parte and that orders sought should be made. I order accordingly.

2706464,Application of Richard Laurence Oades [2013] NSWSC 931,"Judgment

1By summons of 9 July 2013, the New South Wales Crime Commission applied ex parte, seeking orders pursuant to s 33(2) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 ('the Act') for a production order against Caroline Antwan, a person suspected of having possession or control of identified property-tracking documents of Peter Geoffrey Martin.

2 ""Property-tracking document"" is defined in s 4 of the Act to mean:

(a) a document relevant to:
(i) identifying, locating or quantifying any interest in property of a person who might reasonably be suspected of being, or of having been, engaged in a serious crime related activity, or
(ii) identifying or locating any document necessary for the transfer of an interest in property of a person who might reasonably be suspected of being, or of having been, engaged in a serious crime related activity, or
(b) a document relevant to:
(i) identifying, locating or quantifying an interest in property that might reasonably be suspected of being an interest that is serious crime derived property, or
(ii) identifying or locating any document necessary for the transfer of an interest in property that might reasonably be suspected of being an interest that is serious crime derived property.


3The application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 10 July 2013 by Richard Laurence Oades, a forensic accountant and authorised officer under the Act. Annexed is an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the New South Wales Crime Commission's Director (Financial Investigations), as well as a statement of facts provided by the police in relation to Mr Martin and his involvement in clandestine drug laboratories; the manufacture of prohibited drugs and his arrest and charging with an offence under s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 in respect of the drug methylamphetamine, an offence falling within the definition of ""serious criminal offence"" under s 6(2) of the Act. That material was relied on in support of orders sought against Mr Martin under the Act, in matter number 2013/00013314.

4On 15 January 2013 McDougall J made orders in those proceedings under s 10A of the Act in relation to Mr Martin, restraining him from dealing with specified property. 

5Mr Oades deposed that he, too, suspected that Mr Martin has engaged in serious crime related activities within the definition of 'serious criminal offences' in s 6(2) of the Act, namely:

""the manufacture of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) contrary to section 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.

6 Mr Oades also deposed that he suspected that Ms Antwan, a solicitor, had possession or control of property tracking documents in respect of Mr Martin. That suspicion rested on the response of the ANZ Bank, to a notice to attend and produce documents, served on 28 February 2013 and computer searches which Mr Oades had undertaken, as the result of the response received.

7I grant leave to file the summons, the affidavit and statement of facts relied on.

8Having considered that material I am satisfied that the Commission ought not to be required to give notice of this application and that it should be dealt with ex parte. I am also satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicions to which Mr Oades has deposed he holds, that Ms Antwan has possession or control of property-tracking documents of Mr Martin, as provided in s 33 of the Act. 

9In those circumstances I have concluded that the orders sought, requiring the production of the property tracking documents to Mr Oades should be made. I make orders accordingly, in the terms sought.

		15 July 2013",2013-07-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706481,Doolan v R [2013] NSWCCA 145,"Judgment
1EMMETT JA:  This appeal is concerned with the admissibility, in a prosecution for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, of certain statements made by the appellant, Mr William Doolan.  Mr Doolan made the statements in connection with enquiries conducted by the police concerning a stolen motor vehicle.  The appellant was convicted after a trial before a District Court judge and jury.  Before the trial, the trial judge, following a hearing on the voir dire, ruled, over the objection of the appellant, that the statements would be admitted into evidence.  The appellant now appeals from the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erred in admitting the statements into evidence. 
The Factual Background
2On 17 January 2010, police officers at Casino Police Station were called to investigate a Holden utility vehicle (the utility) that was parked in a public road in Casino.  A Senior Constable Opryszko observed that the windows of the utility were down.  Subsequent investigations indicated that the utility was registered in the name of the appellant.  Later in the day, Senior Constable Opryszko and Sergeant Kirk attended the appellant's premises at Wiangaree.  Senior Constable Opryszko spoke to the appellant, who said that he had sold the utility several months earlier to a person ""by the name I think Stephen Graham"".  
3On the following day, 18 January 2010, Constable Hoffman, as a result of a conversation that he had with Sergeant Kirk, drove with Senior Constable Dickson to the appellant's property at Wiangaree.  Constable Hoffman and Senior Constable Dickson both made written statements concerning their visit to the appellant's property.  
4Constable Hoffman made a written statement on 30 June 2010.  Constable Hoffman's statement recorded that, when they arrived, he observed a wooden dwelling with a high pitch roof, situated to the left of the driveway.  There was an attached carport beside the dwelling.  Constable Hoffman's statement said that a late model 4WD jeep vehicle (the jeep) was on the western side of the driveway.  The front of the jeep was up on car ramps, there was an oil filter on the ground underneath the jeep and the bonnet was up in the air.  The rest of the house was surrounded by old and rundown property and equipment.  Constable Hoffman considered that the jeep looked very out of place and peculiar.  The jeep had a Queensland registration plate affixed to the front and he wrote down the registration number.
5As the police vehicle arrived, the appellant walked, from the back of the dwelling, out of the carport towards the police car.  Senior Constable Dickson walked up to the appellant and spoke to him while Constable Hoffman checked the registration of the jeep by means of police radio.  Paragraph 8 of Constable Hoffman's statement of 30 June 2010 is in the following terms:
""After a short conversation with Police radio I confirmed that the vehicle was stolen.  I got out of the Police vehicle and spoke to the [appellant].
I said:  'Who owns the [j]eep over there?'
He said: 'A friend of mine?'
I said:  'What is his name?'
He said: 'I only know him as Steve'
I said  'The registration plate is coming up as being reported stolen'
He said: 'I don't know anything about that'
I said:  'Alright, you don't have to say or do anything if you don't want to, but anything you say or do will be recorded and can be used as evidence in court, do you understand that?'
He said: 'Yeah'
I said:  'The vehicle is on your property, so you don't have to let us seize it, do you understand that?'
He said: 'Yep'
I said:  'Do you have any objections to us arranging to have a tow truck come here and take the vehicle. Remembering that we may conduct examinations on it and the results of those examinations can be used as evidence'.
He said: 'Yeah, that's fine.'""
6Constable Hoffman's statement said that, following that conversation, Constable Hoffman returned to the police vehicle and arranged for the jeep to be towed.  A couple of hours later, a tow truck arrived from Kyogle and the jeep was loaded onto it.  Constable Hoffman and Senior Constable Dickson followed the tow truck into Kyogle.  Later that afternoon, Constable Hoffman inspected the jeep.  Within the cabin of the vehicle he located a pair of ""Motor-X"" gloves, a hypodermic needle disposal pack and a box of tattooing needles.
7Senior Constable Dickson made a written statement on 2 September 2010.  Paragraphs 3 to 5 of Senior Constable Dickson's statement are as follows:
""3.  About 2.45pm on Monday 18 January 2010, Constable HOFFMAN and I attended 1337 Wiangaree Back Road Wiangaree to enquire about a possible stolen motor vehicle on the property.  Upon arrival on the property, I saw a silver Jeep 4WD parked on car ramps on the right hand side of the driveway.  The bonnet was in the air and an oil filter was on the ground underneath the vehicle.  The Jeep had a QLD registration plate ... affixed to the front of the vehicle.
4.  After Constable HOFFMAN stopped the Police vehicle, a male person I know now as William DOOLAN appeared from the patio/carport area at the rear of the premises.  I exited the Police vehicle and approached DOOLAN.  Constable HOFFMAN stayed in the Police vehicle.
I said to DOOLAN, 'Are you William DOOLAN?'
He said, 'Yes'.
I said, 'William, my name is Senior Constable DICKSON and that is Constable HOFFMAN and we are from Kyogle Police.  The reason we are here today is in relation to the Jeep over there.  The registration plate on the front does not match the motor vehicle.  We are going to have a look at the numbers on the Jeep. Is that all right?'
DOOLAN said, 'Yes'.
I said, 'How did the car come to be here?'
He said, ""It was left here when a bloke come and bought a Commodore ute off me.'
5.  I recorded DOOLAN's details in my Police notebook then approached the Jeep.  I saw that the Jeep had been there for some time as there was a large amount of dust and dried leaves across the windscreen and engine bay.  The inside of the vehicle was similar and in a generally dirty state.  I looked at the Jeep's compliance plate and noted the VIN number for the vehicle ...  I gave these details to Constable HOFFMAN and he returned to the Police vehicle.  Shortly after he told me that the vehicle was reported stolen in Queensland.  I returned to DOOLAN who was over in the patio area.
I said, 'William, the vehicle is coming up as stolen, I am going to ask you some questions about the vehicle.  You do not have to say or do anything unless you wish to but whatever you say or do will be recorded and later be used in Court.  Do you understand that?'
He said, 'Yeah'.
I said, 'Who owns the car?'
He said, 'Steven GRAHAM. He's from Brisbane or Lismore'.
I said, 'How old is he?'
He said, 'About 35'.
I said, 'How do you know him?'
He said, 'He bought the ute off me'.
I said, 'Do you have a contact number for him?'
He said, 'No'.
I said, 'How did the car get here?'
He said, 'He turned up in it when he came to buy the ute.  He changed the oil in it and then he left.  I haven't seen him since.'
I said, 'How long ago did the car turn up?'
He said, 'About 3-4 months ago'.
I said, 'Do you think it was weird that he didn't come back for the car?'
He said, 'I thought it was really weird.  I tried to get hold of him but I couldn't find him.'""
8On 19 January 2010, Constable Hoffman applied to the Lismore Local Court for a warrant to search the appellant's premises.  The search warrant was granted.  Following a briefing at Kyogle Police Station concerning execution of the search warrant, Constable Hoffman and others arrived at the appellant's premises at about 1pm on 19 January 2010.  The police that were present were in full police uniform.  Constable Hoffman was met at the rear door of the dwelling by the appellant, to whom Constable Hoffman spoke for a short time while the other police went into the dwelling and secured it.  Constable Hoffman continued to speak with the appellant for a short time before searching commenced inside the dwelling.
9The dwelling is a wooden two-storey building.  The lower level has an open plan lounge, dining, and kitchen area, with a front door and a rear door.  The rear door, where Constable Hoffman spoke to the appellant, leads into the dining area and has a dining table next to it.  To the south are a bathroom and a number of bedrooms, which were occupied by the ex-wife and children of the appellant.
10In the middle of the lounge area is a flight of stairs that leads up to the second storey, which is a loft-style bedroom.  The appellant walked with Constable Hoffman up the stairs and the appellant showed Constable Hoffman a hypodermic needle container identical to that which Constable Hoffman had seen in the jeep the previous day.  Next to the container were several tattooing needles identical to those that had been located in the jeep the previous day.
11Constable Hoffman spoke to the appellant about the room and the appellant indicated that it was his bedroom.  The conversation proceeded as follows:
""[Constable Hoffman] Said: 'Whose room is this?'
[The appellant] Said:  'My room'
[Constable Hoffman] Said: 'This is your bedroom.  Is anyone else staying here with you?'
[The appellant] Said:  'Nah'.
[Constable Hoffman] Said: 'Just you?'
[The appellant] Said:  Yeah'"".
12At about 1.15pm, Senior Constable Opryszko identified to Constable Hoffman a black coloured metal tin in the top drawer of a dressing table within the loft bedroom.  The black coloured metal tin contained four resealable plastic bags.  Inside the plastic bags were several small green coloured pills.  Constable Hoffman asked the appellant whether he wished to make any comment about the black coloured metal tin.  The appellant declined to do so.  
13At 1.31pm, Senior Constable Opryszko located a sports bag on the floor of the bedroom near a bed.  Within the sports bag there were, amongst other things, a Queensland driver's licence in the name of Daniel Watson, a healthcare card in the name of Daniel Watson and an occupational health and safety card in the name of Daniel Watson.  Constable Hoffman asked the appellant if he wished to comment on any of those items.  The appellant declined to do so.  
14At 1.34pm, Senior Constable Dickson located on the kitchen table a single stalk of a plant that Constable Hoffman believed to be cannabis.  At 1.40pm, Senior Constable Opryszko located a small amount of cannabis on a buffet-style bench behind the kitchen table.  At 1.45pm, Constable Lack located a number of cannabis seeds in a cupboard in the laundry area above the washing machine.  At 1.48pm, Senior Constable Dickson located a large amount of cannabis leaf underneath the kitchen table lying on the ground in the main dining area.  At 1.55pm, Constable Lack located, in a cupboard above the washing machine in the laundry area, several plastic bags and foil packets containing cannabis seeds.  At 2pm, Senior Constable Dickson and Senior Constable Opryszko located a plastic sachet containing cannabis leaf on the buffet table in the kitchen area.  At 2.42pm, Senior Constable Dickson located a single cannabis plant behind a shed at the eastern side of the dwelling, less than 10 metres from the side of the dwelling.
15At 3pm, Constable Hoffman concluded the search.  Constable Hoffman informed the appellant that many of the items that had been seized would have to be examined and that he would receive some paperwork in the following months.  Constable Hoffman then returned to Kyogle Police Station.  Subsequently, Constable Hoffman ascertained from the Queensland Police Service that Daniel Watson was killed in an accidental shooting in May 2007.
16On 22 January 2010, the appellant attended Kyogle Police Station and informed Senior Constable Dickson that he wished to make a statement about the search warrant and the jeep left at his property.  On that day, the appellant made a written statement.  In his statement, the appellant said that he resided at the Wiangaree premises with his ex-wife and his two sons and the girlfriend of one his sons.  His ex-wife stayed sometimes and was at the house more during the week than not.  His sons lived there permanently, as did the girlfriend of one of his sons.  The appellant had lived at the property for 10 or 11 years.
17Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the appellant's statement are in the following terms:
""4.  Around 4pm on one day in late August to early September 2009, Colin STEVENS and Jay WHITE attended my property.  Jay WHITE is in his mid 30's and is a medium build and about 85kgs.  He had sandy hair.  I was told WHITE hung around Lismore.  They arrived in a silver Jeep with Jay driving.  Jay, Colin and I had a drink and they stayed the night.  Jay WHITE left the next day but Colin stayed for two to three weeks before leaving.  One day, Jay turned up and put the Jeep up on ramps and dropped the oil out of it.  I sold Colin my white ute and they left later that day in it.  Jay came back one or twice but never took the Jeep over the next few months.  I never saw him again.  The Jeep stayed up on the ramps.  I asked STEVENS to speak with WHITE and get him to take the Jeep and his stuff from my property. He told me he would but this never happened.
5.  On 18 January 2010, the Police attended my property at 1337 Wiangaree Back Road, Wiangaree.  The Police informed me that the QLD registration plate attached to the Jeep was stolen.  They later told me that the Jeep was also stolen and they were seizing it.  A tow truck took the Jeep away and the Police left.
6. On 19 January 2010, the Police attended my property with a search warrant.  I informed the Police during the search warrant that the upstairs loft area was mine.  I share that area with Colin STEVENS when he resides there.  STEVENS will stay for a few days then disappear for a few days.  He left on the Saturday prior to the search warrant.  My living area is at the far end of the loft, from the bed back to the window.  The drawers, the bunk bed and anything near the stairs belongs to STEVENS.  I didn't know what possessions STEVENS had prior to the search warrant.""
18The green coloured pills that were found in the black coloured metal tin contained 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine in an amount of 9.41 grams.  The appellant was charged with supplying that substance contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  The appellant stood trial before Black DCJ and a jury at the Lismore District Court on 1 September 2011 and following.  The jury, after retiring to consider its verdict at 10.13am on 8 September 2011, returned a verdict of guilty at 2.19pm on 9 September 2011.  On 30 November 2011, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 15 months, suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The appellant appeals from the conviction but does not seek leave to appeal in respect of the severity of the sentence. 
The Appeal
19The notice of appeal specified a single ground as follows:
His Honour erred in admitting the evidence in relation to the stolen cars.
Particulars of error:
a)His Honour erred in concluding that the evidence was relevant.
b)His Honour erred in failing to have regard to Parts 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8 of the Evidence Act.
c)His Honour erred in his assessment of the probative value and unfair prejudicial effect of the evidence.
20The notice of appeal does not identify with any greater particularity ""the evidence in relation to the stolen cars"" referred to in the notice of appeal.  In the course of the hearing of the appeal, however, counsel for the appellant indicated that the disputed evidence that was admitted at the trial consists of:
(1)Paragraph 8 of Constable Hoffman's statement of 30 June 2010;
(2)Paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of Senior Constable Dickson's statement of 2 September 2010; and
(3)Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the appellant's statement of 22 January 2010.
The Ruling of the Trial Judge
21In the course of argument on the voir dire concerning the admissibility of the disputed evidence, the Crown indicated that counsel for the appellant was objecting to any evidence being led about the appellant's account to the police on 18 January 2010 ""as to Stephen Graham coming with the ute"".  The Crown also indicated that there was an issue about any reference to Jay White and the vehicle in the appellant's statement of 22 January 2010.  The Crown then provided copies of the statements of Constable Hoffman of 30 June 2010, Senior Constable Dickson of 2 September 2010 and the appellant of 22 January 2010.  The Crown also tendered other statements.
22Counsel for the appellant said that anything in relation to the jeep, and the names given to the police officers in relation to a jeep that was stolen, apparently in 2008, was inadmissible, on the basis that it was irrelevant.  Counsel for the appellant contended that a conversation between the police and the appellant concerning names in relation to the allegedly stolen jeep had no relevance to the charge against the appellant and that the utility, and the story about it, had nothing to do with the finding of drugs in the appellant's house.  Counsel for the appellant said that, whether the utility had been bought by Mr Colin Stevens or by Mr Stephen Graham was irrelevant.  
23The trial judge referred to the conflicting statements as to whether or not it was Mr Stephen Graham or Mr Colin Stevens who was the purchaser of the utility and the person who left the jeep, observing that Mr Graham had become Mr Stevens.  Counsel for the appellant said that that was not correct: rather, Mr Graham had become Mr Stevens and Mr White.  The trial judge responded that one of them turned out to be occupying the room where the drugs were and it would be a matter for the jury as to whether anybody other than the appellant was occupying the area where the drugs were found.  
24Counsel for the appellant responded that the problem was that the jury would hear all the extraneous material about a stolen jeep, a matter that was still before the Local Court, with charges pending, and that it should not be mentioned before the jury on the hearing of the charge of supplying drugs.  Counsel for the appellant informed the trial judge that the appellant had been charged with possessing property stolen outside New South Wales.  His Honour said that the fact that the appellant had been charged did not need to emerge in the present trial.  Counsel for the appellant responded that, nevertheless, the jury would hear two stories about the jeep that had no bearing on the charge concerning the drugs.
25Counsel for the appellant then said that the evidence about the jeep being towed away, because it was a stolen vehicle, would be extremely prejudicial.  The jury would be listening to evidence about a stolen car and two different versions and would be thinking that ""maybe that's a bit dodgy"".  Counsel for the appellant said that it would not be enough for the jury to be directed about that.  
26Counsel for the appellant said that the jury would hear that the jeep was stolen and that the appellant had given two different versions as to how it came to be on his property, the first being that it was dropped off by a man called Stephen Graham and the second being that it was dropped off by a person by the name of Jay White.  She said that the jury would think ""that it's dodgy and that he's dodgy"" because of his relationship with the stolen car and, therefore, the prejudicial material was so prejudicial that it should not go before the jury at all.  
27Counsel for the appellant then submitted that the evidence about the jeep being left three to four months, or some eight to nine months, prior to January 2010, had no relevance to something that was found in a room in January 2010.  The trial judge said that the appellant's statement referred to selling the utility to Mr Colin Stevens, whereas, on 18 January 2010, he said he sold it to somebody else, and that Mr Stevens was now put forward as a joint occupier of the room where the drugs were found.  His Honour said that Mr Stevens was put forward as the purchaser of the utility and the person who stays on and off in the room.  The previous account was that the purchaser of the utility turned up one day and had not been seen since.  His Honour said that he considered that that was relevant.  
28Counsel for the appellant repeated that the fact that the appellant said that Colin Stevens purchased the utility on the day that Jay White turned up with him was not relevant and asserted that there was no nexus between a person purchasing a utility some three to four months beforehand and then subsequently saying that the person stayed in the room on and off.  Counsel for the appellant submitted that, while, if that was all that was said, it might not be prejudicial, there was still no relevance.  If the only discussion that was had was about the utility, and not the stolen jeep, there would not have to be any discussion in relation to the jeep.  Ultimately, counsel for the appellant said, it was irrelevant because there was no nexus between nominating Colin Stevens as being a purchaser of a utility and then Colin Stevens coming back in late 2009 or 2010.
29The Crown submitted to the trial judge that whether or not Colin Stevens stayed at the premises was relevant to the drug charge, and that the jury was only able to assess the credibility and reliability of the appellant's account if the jury had the full account that he had given in relation to that matter.  The full account included the explanation given in respect of Stephen Graham initially and then the sudden appearance of Jay White.  The Crown said that the matter could be run, if necessary, on the basis that the police were making enquiries about the motor vehicle and in relation to the statement.  There was then further discussion between counsel and the trial judge concerning the editing of the statements to exclude the references to the other plants and items that were located in the course of executing the search warrant.  
30In his reasons for admitting the disputed evidence, the trial judge did not identify with any specificity the evidence to which objection was taken.  His Honour referred to ""evidence on stolen jeep"" and said that objection was taken to some evidence from the police officers relating to events on 18 January 2010 when they arrived at the appellant's premises.  His Honour said that those events related to a jeep, which was alleged to be stolen.  His Honour said that the issue arose because, on the following day, the police arrived with a search warrant.  In an upstairs loft in the appellant's premises, which the appellant indicated that he occupied on his own, were found the drugs that are the subject of the indictment.  
31The trial judge then referred to the fact that, on 22 January 2010, three days after the search warrant was executed, the appellant arrived at the local police station and made a statement in connection with the occupancy of the room and dealing with the jeep that was alleged to be stolen.  His Honour referred to the assertion in the appellant's statement of 22 January 2010 that he sold the utility to a person called Colin Stevens whereas, on 18 January 2010, he had told the officers that he had sold it to somebody called Stephen Graham.  His Honour said that the details of Mr Stevens did not coincide with Mr Graham; nor did his activities and nor did his whereabouts.  His Honour referred to the fact that the statement of 22 January 2010 went on to say that Mr Stevens was a regular visitor, and in fact on a frequent basis occupied the area upstairs where the drugs were found.  His Honour also referred to the fact that the statement of 22 January 2010 asserted that the drawers, the bunk bed and anything near the stairs belonged to Mr Stevens.  His Honour said that the issue clearly was whether there was another occupant who may have been responsible for the presence of the drugs in question.
32The trial judge recorded that counsel for the appellant had objected to the evidence on the basis that it was not relevant.  His Honour did not see that that was arguable and considered that the evidence was clearly relevant as to who it was that was in the loft room, if anybody, apart from the appellant.  His Honour said that, given what the appellant said on 18 January 2010, and what he said on 22 January 2010, there was a clear conflict as to who was the purchaser of the utility.
33The trial judge also referred to the fact that the Crown had made available a statement from Mr Stevens saying that he would give evidence that he was a regular occupier of the room in question.  His Honour said that there was some reference to a jeep in Mr Stevens' statement but there was no reference to a utility.  His Honour did not consider that that was relevant at that stage.
34Having concluded that the disputed evidence was relevant, the trial judge then considered the submission advanced on behalf of the appellant that the evidence would be unduly prejudicial.  His Honour did not see why that was so.  His Honour observed that the evidence relating to the jeep, which was said to be stolen, was that, when asked, the appellant said that he did not know that it was stolen and that the jeep was not his and that it belonged to either Mr Graham or Mr Stevens.  
35The trial judge said that the jury would be directed that any issue about the jeep was not for them and that any question as to whether or not it was stolen and, if so, to whose knowledge it was stolen, was quite immaterial.  The jury would be directed that the only issue was whether the appellant was in possession of the drugs in the upstairs of the house.  His Honour did not see that there was any undue prejudicial effect at that stage.  However, his Honour foreshadowed that there may be further discussion about editing various statements.  His Honour observed that it would be helpful if the parties could sort that out themselves but that, if they could not, he would rule on it.  Notwithstanding those observations, there does not appear to have been any further discussion, in the course of the trial, concerning the admissibility of the disputed evidence.  
The Relevant Provisions of the Evidence Act
36Under s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Evidence Act), the evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.  Under s 56, except as otherwise provided, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceeding and evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible.
37Under s 97 of the Evidence Act, evidence of a person's character, reputation or conduct is inadmissible, if the evidence is sought to be adduced to prove that the person has, or had, a tendency to act in a particular way, unless notice is given and the evidence, either alone or together with other evidence to be adduced, has significant probative value.  Section 101 prohibits the admission of tendency evidence unless its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect that the evidence may have.  
38Under s 101A of the Evidence Act, evidence that is only relevant because it affects the assessment of the credibility of a witness or person is credibility evidence.  Under s 102, credibility evidence is inadmissible unless one of the identified exceptions applies.  One such exception is provided by s 103, under which credibility evidence may be adduced in cross-examination if the evidence could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of a witness.
39Under s 104 of the Evidence Act, an accused may not be cross-examined about a matter relevant to the assessment of his or her credit without the leave of the court.  Such leave must not be granted unless certain conditions are met.  One condition is that the accused has adduced evidence that tends to prove that a Crown witness has a tendency to be untruthful and that evidence was relevant solely, or mainly, to that witness's credit.  
The Appellant's Contentions on the Appeal
40The appellant contends that the evidence that was critical to the trial judge's determination was the inconsistency between the person nominated by the appellant on 17 January 2010 and 18 January 2010 as being the person responsible for the cars, namely Stephen Graham, and the person nominated in his statement of 22 January 2010 as being the person responsible for the cars as well as the drugs, namely Colin Stevens.  The appellant contended that the trial judge had concluded that the falsity of nominating Stephen Graham was relevant as to who it was that was in the room, if anybody, apart from the appellant.  The appellant contended that, by saying that the jury would be directed that any issue about whether the jeep was stolen or not was immaterial, his Honour implicitly accepted that questions as to the ownership of the vehicles was not a fact in issue in the proceeding.  The appellant contended that the sole relevance of the appellant's lies about Stephen Graham was as admissions that went to his credibility in his account of who possessed the drugs.  Thus, it was contended, its relevance was as a statement expressing consciousness of guilt.  
41The appellant contended that the disputed evidence could not support an inference that the statements about Stephen Graham were made out of the knowledge that the truth would implicate him in the offence charged.  When the appellant nominated Stephen Graham, the police were not investigating the presence of drugs.  The statements made on 17 January 2010 and 18 January 2010 could not, the submission went, have been made out of a consciousness of guilt about the drugs.  If they had been, the appellant would have removed the drugs from his property immediately upon the departure of the police on 18 January 2010.  Therefore, the nomination by the appellant of Stephen Graham as the owner of the utility and the jeep was, so the submissions went, not relevant as an admission.  The inference that the statements regarding Stephen Graham were made out of a consciousness of guilt about the drugs was, therefore, not available on the evidence.
42The appellant contended that no other basis was identified as to how his lies could rationally affect the assessment of his statements.  The only other conceivable relevance of the evidence was to prove that the appellant had a tendency to lie, or for the purpose of assessing the credibility of the account given by him in his statement of 22 January 2010, or to prove the bad character of the appellant.  In the circumstances, the submission went, the evidence would be inadmissible on any of those bases.
43The appellant contended that, as a result of the admission of the lie regarding Stephen Graham, a considerable amount of evidence was led in an attempt to prove that what he subsequently said, on 22 January 2010, about the motor vehicles, the utility in particular, was true and to explain the purpose of the lie.  Both categories of evidence occupied a substantial proportion of the hearing time and neither had any significant probative value in determining the real issue in the trial, namely, whether the Crown could establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had exclusive possession of the drugs.  
44The Crown did not dispute that Colin Stevens had in fact purchased the utility from the appellant, but suggested that the utility had been purchased with drugs that were the subject of the indictment.  The evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant to explain the purpose of the lie focused on the criminal past of Colin Stevens and the fact that the appellant was intimidated by him.  
45The Court has a wide discretion as to whether a new trial should be ordered.  The appellant points to the fact that, by the time the appeal is dealt with, he will have served a substantial part, if not the whole, of the sentence imposed.  He says that, if the Court of Criminal Appeal finds that the disputed evidence was not properly admitted and allows the appeal, a conviction is unlikely.  He points to the fact that the drugs were found in a bedroom with two beds.  The second bed had bed clothing on it and clothing and other furniture in the room supported the appellant's evidence, and the evidence of Mr Stevens, that they were sharing the room during the relevant period.  The Crown did not dispute that fact.  
46Further, the appellant says, there was no direct evidence that otherwise linked the appellant with the drugs, or the name Stephen Graham, in the context of assessing the credibility of his account in relation to the drugs.  The appellant asserted that the lie told by him could never rationally have been told out of consciousness of guilt in relation to the drugs.  Therefore, it was submitted, the direction about stolen vehicles, in addition to placing additional emphasis on inadmissible evidence, would have been confusing to the jury.
47Under s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Court may, notwithstanding that it is of the opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal may be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.  The appellant contends that it could not be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred, unless the Court is persuaded that the evidence admitted at the trial proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the appellant's guilt of the offence of supplying prohibited drugs.  He contends that, in the present case, the properly admissible evidence squarely left open the question of whether or not the appellant had exclusive possession of the drugs.  Accordingly, the Court should not be persuaded that the evidence that was properly admitted would have proved the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  Therefore, the appellant says, if the Court accepts that the disputed evidence should not have been admitted and allows the appeal, conviction at a second trial is unlikely.  
Whether the Trial Judge Erred
48The statements made to Senior Constable Dickson on 17 January 2010 and 18 January 2010 are inconsistent with the appellant's statement of 22 January 2010 as to a fact in issue, namely, whether or not there was another occupant of the loft area who may have been responsible for the presence of the drugs.  The statement of 18 January 2010, in which no mention is made of Colin Stevens and in which Stephen Graham is nominated as coming in the jeep to buy the utility, is entirely in conflict with the appellant's statement of 22 January 2010, which replaces Stephen Graham with Colin Stevens and Jay White, saying that Jay White drove the jeep and Colin Stevens bought the utility.  
49It was a fact in issue whether or not Colin Stevens had access to the loft and the drugs the subject of the charge.  The question is whether the appellant's initial giving of a false name, Stephen Graham, instead of his later statement of the names Jay White and Colin Stevens, in relation to the person or persons who had responsibility for the cars, could rationally affect the probability of the existence of the fact as to whether or not any other person had access to the loft area and thus may have been responsible for the presence of the drugs.  The conversations in issue were not simply statements about the cars but were conversations about  certain individuals.
50The appellant's statements concerning Stephen Graham and the jeep were relevant to a fact in issue in the trial, namely, whether any other person had access to the loft area.  The statements concerning Stephen Graham and the jeep were relevant, such that they could rationally affect, at least indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a relevant fact, namely, who came to the appellant's property, when that person did so, the purpose for which the person did so and the circumstances in which the person did so.  All of those matters were relevant to the issue of who had access to the loft area and whether or not the presence of such a person could potentially negate the appellant's possession of the drugs.  Accordingly, the Crown contends, the statements about Stephen Graham were admissible as relevant representations made by the appellant for a purpose other than proof of an asserted fact.  They were admissible under s 60, as well as under s 66A, as being a contemporaneous representation about the appellant's knowledge.
51Once the relevance of a prior statement has been established, the statement is evidence of the truth of the statement, unless application is made under s 136 of the Evidence Act to limit its use.  No such application was made on behalf of the appellant.  
52Prior inconsistent statements do not amount to character evidence.  Further, the disputed evidence was not relied upon by the Crown as constituting a tendency of the appellant to lie.  There was no failure to have regard to Parts 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8 of the Evidence Act.
53The Crown's case was that the appellant had given two versions of events that occurred at his property.  The first, made on 18 January 2010, concerned the attendance of Stephen Graham.  The second, made in his statement of 22 January 2010, confirmed that the statement about Stephen Graham was false and asserted that there were in fact two people who had come to the appellant's property with the jeep.  The two versions are incapable of standing together.
54Having concluded that the disputed evidence was relevant, the trial judge considered its probative value and the question of unfair prejudice.  Section 137 provides that, in a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.  The probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.  The use of the world could draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude.  Evidence has probative value, for the purposes of s 137, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty.  It was open to the jury to conclude that the appellant's initial response to police was the truthful one.  If they so concluded, the appellant would be found to be in possession of the drugs.  Indeed, if the jury accepted the truth of the appellant's initial statement, the jury was almost bound to do so, since there was no limitation placed on the prior inconsistent statement under s 136 of the Evidence Act.  
55In relation to the danger of unfair prejudice element of s 137, counsel for the appellant asserted that the disputed evidence was extremely prejudicial because the appellant was contradicting himself and there were two different versions about a stolen car.  However, prejudice is only operative in the s 137 weighing process to the extent it is unfair.  As stated above, for the purposes of s 137, evidence will be probative only if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty.  Evidence is not prejudicial for the purposes of s 137 merely because it strengthens the prosecution case.  It is prejudicial for the purposes of s 137 only when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or content of the evidence may inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task (see Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 at [51]).  
56There may be real unfairness to a defendant if jurors are likely to view particular evidence as doing more harm to the defendant's case than the evidence objectively merits by, for example, giving it undue weight or by using it to engage in an impermissible form of reasoning, such as tendency or coincidence reasoning (see R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA 520 at [252]).  Section 137 involves weighing the extent to which, having regard to the whole of the evidence that is to be given, the evidence is capable of proving the prosecution case and thus being harmful to the defendant's case, against the risk that that evidence will be taken by the jury to do more harm to the defendant's case than is objectively or properly warranted in the circumstances.  
57It may be, therefore, that the weighing process under s 137 involves considerations that, while distinct and opposing, are not entirely incommensurable.  It involves weighing the extent to which impugned evidence is fairly prejudicial, in the sense that it is capable of being properly detrimental to the defendant's case, against the risk that the impugned evidence will lead the jury, because of its capacity to elicit emotional reactions or impermissible reasoning, to treat it in such a way that is unfairly prejudicial, in the sense that it is improperly detrimental to the defendant's case.
58The weighing of the unfair detriment to a defendant's case against the fair detriment must incorporate consideration of any judicial directions that could be given to minimise the prejudice (see R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [37]).  Thus, there must be a real risk that the jury will misuse the evidence in some way and that the risk will exist, notwithstanding a proper direction from the court, which it should be assumed will be given.  In the present case, the disputed evidence contained a denial by the appellant that he owned the jeep and that he did not know that it was stolen.  There was no suggestion that he was facing any charges in relation to the jeep.
59At the trial, the trial judge gave a direction to the jury concerning the allegations about motor cars that had not been lawfully acquired, some having been stolen.  His Honour directed the jury that that was ""by the by"" and that it was not a trial about motor cars.  His Honour directed that those issues had not been gone into and that the jury had only heard about all of that because of what was said in relation to who was responsible for the motor cars and the initial introduction of Mr Stephen Graham.  His Honour concluded by saying that it was very important that the jury not transfer any concern about the motor cars onto the issue about drugs, and that that was important.  
60By giving those directions to the jury, the relevance of the motor vehicles was highlighted, but without the evidence about the motor vehicles substantially impinging, in terms of unfair prejudice, on the question of whether or not the appellant was in possession of the drugs.  The jury was reminded, during the Crown's closing address, that the fact in issue in the trial was the possession of the drugs.  The jury was reminded of the appellant's conversation with Senior Constable Dickson on 19 January concerning the loft area.  That was necessary because of the appellant's statement of 22 January 2010, which contained information contrary to the information originally given to police on 17 and 18 January 2010.  The fact of, and circumstances surrounding, the jeep coming onto the appellant's property three to four months previous was relevant to a fact in issue, namely, who had attended on that day and whether or not that person had the opportunity to bring onto and leave at the appellant's property the drugs the subject of the charges.  
61The trial judge had proper regard to s 137 and gave appropriate directions to minimise any possible prejudice.  In his summing up, the trial judge gave a direction on lies.  His Honour clearly told the jury that they should approach the question of the appellant's lies with considerable care, before they could take that into account.   
62The issue before the jury was whether the relevant parts of the appellant's statement of 22 January 2010 were a lie, told by the appellant after the fact, to negate the issue of possession of the drugs.  Replacing Stephen Graham with Jay White and Colin Stevens was directly relevant to the issue of possession because those two had supposedly stayed over night in the loft area about three or four months previously.  Their presence provided an alternative explanation consistent with innocence for the presence of the drugs in the black coloured metal tin in the chest of drawers.  That is why questions were raised about the existence of Jay White.
63The jury was informed that the fact in issue was whether the appellant was in possession of the prohibited drugs.  The jury was directed that the determination of that issue would depend, in part, upon what conclusions were drawn about the appellant's conversation with police, the contents of his statement of 22 January 2010 and the view that the jury formed about the honesty and accuracy of the appellant and Colin Stevens.  The jury's verdict must be taken to be a rejection of the appellant's case, namely, that the pills belonged to Jay White or Colin Stevens and were, unbeknownst to him, deposited at some point during their stay, when they attended with the jeep.  The impugned evidence relating to the appellant's statements about the stolen jeep is probative, because those statements inextricably tied the issue of who occupied the loft with the identity of the individuals involved with the jeep and the utility.  The impugned evidence was thus relevant to the question of who occupied the loft where the drugs were found.  While there was a risk that the impugned evidence would be unfairly prejudicial to the appellant, in involving mention of a stolen jeep, that risk was substantially eliminated by the trial judge's direction.  In the circumstances, the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice to the appellant.
Conclusion
64There was no error in the ruling made by the trial judge on the voir dire.  For the reasons indicated above, the disputed evidence was relevant.  Further, it was not relevantly prejudicial such that it should have been excluded under s 137.  The appeal should be dismissed. 
65SIMPSON J:  I have read in draft the judgments of Emmett JA and Latham J.  I take a different approach and come to a different result.  
66On 1 September 2011 the appellant was arraigned in the District Court at Lismore on an indictment that charged a single count of supply of a prohibited drug (MDMA, also known as ecstasy).  He entered a plea of not guilty and a trial before a jury proceeded.  On 8 September 2011 the jury returned a verdict of guilty.  Subsequently the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 15 months.  Pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, execution of that sentence was suspended.
67The appellant now appeals against the conviction.  He does not seek leave to appeal against the sentence.  The sole ground of appeal upon which he relies concerns the admission of certain evidence.  The ground of appeal is formulated as follows:
""1.  His Honour erred in admitting the evidence in relation to the stolen car.
Particulars of error:
(a)  His Honour erred in concluding that the evidence was relevant;
(b)  His Honour erred in failing to have regard to Parts 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8 of the Evidence Act;
(c)  His Honour erred in his assessment of the probative value and unfair prejudicial effect of the evidence.""
(Part 3.6 of the Evidence Act 1995 deals with tendency and coincidence evidence; Pt 3.7 deals with credibility evidence; Pt 3.8 deals with character evidence.)
The Crown case
68The Crown case of supply was based upon s 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (""the DMT Act""), pursuant to which possession of not less than a specified quantity of a prohibited drug is deemed to be for the purpose of supply (unless specified circumstances, not here relevant, exist), and the definition of ""supply"" in s 3, pursuant to which possession for the purpose of supply constitutes supply.
69The core facts the Crown alleged can be shortly stated.
70As at 19 January 2010 the appellant lived in a two-storey house on a rural property in a country town near Kyogle in northern NSW.  Also living in the house, but separately, was his former wife, Leanne Remado Doolan, the appellant's two sons, and the girlfriend of one of the sons.  The appellant occupied a loft style bedroom on the second storey of the house.  On 19 January 2010 police officers (including Constable Steve Hoffman, Senior Constable Opryszko, and Senior Constable Dickson) executed a search warrant at the premises.  The appellant accompanied the police officers through the loft bedroom, which he acknowledged to be his.  He was asked if anybody else was staying there with him to which he replied ""Nah"".  Asked ""Just you?"", he replied ""Yeah"".  
71Senior Constable Opryszko searched a dressing table in the bedroom, in the top drawer of which he located a black metal tin which contained four plastic resealable bags.  In the bags were 34 ""small green coloured pills with a cannabis imprint on the side"".  When given an opportunity to comment on the pills, the appellant declined.  Later analysis identified the tablets as MDMA.  The quantity was sufficient to satisfy s 29 of the DMT Act, such that possession would be deemed to be for the purpose of supply.
72I interpolate that, on those facts, the Crown could establish a prima facie case.  
73However, on Friday, 22 January 2010, the appellant presented himself to Senior Constable Dickson at the Kyogle Police Station.  He told Senior Constable Dickson that he wished to provide a statement.  Omitting formal parts, the statement was in the following terms:
""3.  I reside at ... with my ex-wife Leanne DOOLAN, my son Matthew DOOLAN and his girlfriend Nicki MCCONNELL, and my son Liam DOOLAN.  Leanne stays sometimes at the house and is at the house more during the week than not.  The others live there on a permanent basis.  I have lived at the property for 10-11 years.  
4.  Around 4pm one day in late August to early September 2009, Colin STEVENS and Jay WHITE attended my property.  Jay WHITE is in his mid thirties and is a medium build and about 85kgs.  He had sandy hair.  I was told WHITE hung around Lismore.  They arrived in a silver Jeep with Jay driving.  Jay, Colin and I had a drink and they stayed the night.  Jay WHITE left the next day but Colin stayed for two to three weeks before leaving.  One day, Jay turned up and put the Jeep up on ramps and dropped the oil out of it.  I sold Colin my white ute and they left later that day in it.  Jay came back once or twice but never took the Jeep over the next few months.  I never saw him again.  The Jeep stayed up on the ramps.  I asked STEVENS to speak with WHITE and get him to take the Jeep and his stuff from my property.  He told me he would but this never happened.
5.  On 18 January 2010, the police attended my property at ... The police informed me that the QLD registration plate attached to the Jeep was stolen.  They later told me that the Jeep was also stolen and they were seizing it.  A tow truck took the Jeep away and the police left.
6.  On 19 January 2010, the police attended my property with a search warrant.  I informed the police during the search warrant that the upstairs loft area was mine.  I share that area with Colin STEVENS when he resides there.  STEVENS will stay for a few days then disappear for a few days.  He left on the Saturday prior to the search warrant.  My living area is at the far end of the loft, from the bed back to the window.  The drawers, the bunk bed and anything near the stairs belongs to STEVENS.  I didn't know what possessions STEVENS had prior to the search warrant.""
74At the time he made this statement, the appellant had not been charged with any offence.  There is material before this Court (Particulars of Trial), not presented in the trial, that the appellant was charged with the offence by being served with a Court Attendance Notice on 15 July 2010. 
75It could be anticipated, from the appellant's statement (which became Exhibit C in the trial), that he would defend any charge that eventuated on the basis that the drugs were not under his exclusive control: see Filippetti v R (1978) 13 A Crim R 335; R v Anderson (NSWCCA, 15 December 1983, unreported); R v Bazley (NSWCCA, 23 March 1989, unreported).
76Accordingly, in order to rebut such a defence, the Crown proposed to adduce evidence of statements previously made by the appellant, inconsistent with what he had said in his statement.  This evidence was evidence concerning two vehicles, a Holden Commodore utility and a Jeep Cherokee, and includes the evidence the subject of the ground of appeal.  Since the ground of appeal challenges the decision to admit the evidence, it is appropriate that it be considered on the basis of the material that was before the judge when he made the decision.  A voir dire was conducted, at the outset of the trial, and before the jury was empanelled.  A number of statements were before the judge.  For that reason, what follows is drawn, not from the transcript of the trial, but from the statements on which the Crown proposed to rely, and upon which the trial judge determined to admit the evidence.  The evidence on the voir dire was to the following effect.
77On 18 January 2010, Senior Constable Opryszko and Senior Constable Dickson went to the appellant's property.  There they saw a silver Jeep Cherokee, which was on ramps and which appeared to have been there for some time.  Senior Constable Dickson ascertained that the vehicle had been reported stolen in Queensland.  He told the appellant that it was stolen, and cautioned him.  According to Senior Constable Dickson's statement, the following conversation then took place:
Constable Dickson:  Who owns the car?
Appellant:  Steven Graham.  He's from Brisbane or Lismore.
Constable Dickson:  How old is he?
Appellant:  About 35.
Constable Dickson:  How do you know him?
Appellant:  He bought the ute off me.
Constable Dickson:  Do you have a contact number for him?
Appellant:  No.
Constable Dickson:  How did the car get here?
Appellant:  He turned up in it when he came to buy the ute.  He changed the oil in it and then he left.  I haven't seen him since.
Constable Dickson:  How long ago did the car turn up?
Appellant:  About 3-4 months ago.
Constable Dickson:  Did you think it was weird that he didn't come back for the car?
Appellant:  I thought it was really weird.  I tried to get hold of him but I couldn't find him.
Constable Dickson:  What did you plan on doing with the car if no one came back for it?
Appellant:  I wasn't on planning doing anything.  It's his - it's not mine.
Constable Dickson:  So you never met Steven Graham the day before you sold him the Commodore?
Appellant:  No.
Constable Dickson:  How many times have you been inside the car?
Appellant:  Once.  That was yesterday when the other guys come out.
Constable Dickson:  Were you aware that the Jeep was stolen before the police informed you earlier today?
Appellant:  No.
This conversation was recorded in Constable Dickson's notebook, which was signed by the appellant.
78Curiously, Constable Hoffman gave a similar, although abbreviated, account of a conversation with the appellant.  I say curiously because Constable Hoffman attributes the questions, not to Constable Dickson, but to himself.  
79In August 2011, Constable Hoffman made various inquiries with a view to locating ""Jay White"".  The results of the inquiries were such as to cast doubt on the reliability or credibility of the appellant's account in paragraph 4 of his 22 January statement.
80Also before the judge was a statement made by Colin Stevens, but it has no bearing on the present issue.
81The attendance at the appellant's property was not entirely spontaneous.  The day before, 17 January, Casino Police had become aware of a suspicious vehicle (the Holden utility) parked in a Casino street.  Inquiries proved that the appellant was the registered owner.  Senior Constable Opryszko spoke to the appellant, who told him that he had sold the vehicle, several months earlier, to a man called Steven Graham.  He said that he did not know Mr Graham's address or location ""or anything like that"".  This evidence was given by Senior Constable Opryszko in the trial.  It was not presented in the voir dire.  I mention it to give context to the arrival of the police at the appellant's premises on 18 January and again on 19 January.
The District Court proceedings
82Before the jury was empanelled defence counsel notified an objection to some of the evidence on which the Crown proposed to rely.  Counsel did not identify, with any degree of clarity, the evidence to which objection was taken.  The transcript records that, in response to a question from the trial judge, she said:
""I'm saying the material that's inadmissible is anything in relation to the Jeep and the names given to the police officers in relation to a Jeep which was stolen, apparently, in 2008 and when your Honour looks at the statement of Senior Constable Dickson, he notes that there was a considerable amount of grass etc underneath the Jeep which is at that stage on some blocks.""
She said that the basis of the objection was relevance, and asked, rhetorically:
""What relevance does a connection with a stolen Jeep have with what's in the house?""
83A fairly lengthy debate ensued, between defence counsel and the trial judge.  Inter alia, counsel is recorded in the transcript as saying:
""Your Honour, the problem is that the jury are going to hear all this extraneous material about a stolen Jeep, that's a matter that's still in the Local Court, charges are pending, it shouldn't be heard before this jury, it's a charge of deem (sic) supply.""
and:
""Yes your Honour but they're going to hear two stories in relation to the Jeep, which really has no bearing.  The fact that the Jeep was stolen outside NSW has no bearing on this trial.""
84The Trial Advocate, representing the Crown, is recorded as saying:
""No and your Honour, in relation to and I said this before lunch in relation to when the papers were handed up, I do think that the matter could be run, if necessary, on the basis that the police were making inquiries about the motor vehicle and in relation to the statement, the notebook statement, that Mr Doolan made on 18 January, which he signed in Senior Constable Dickson's notebook.  I wouldn't be proposing to lead the last question and answer, which relates to were you aware that the Jeep was stolen before you were informed about that?  So in the Crown submission that would also ameliorate -- 
HIS HONOUR:  What you're saying is that there would be some editing because in fact that's referred to in Mr Hoffman's statement too.
...
TRIAL ADVOCATE:  No your Honour, that's all been excluded, it's been narrowed down to simply --
HIS HONOUR:  Alright, so there'll be further editing to do about what you say.  Do you need to have time to discuss that or do you want to say to me now what you've got in mind?"" (bold added)
85His Honour appears to have accepted that the parties could agree on the editing of the statements and indicated that he would not uphold defence counsel's objection.  The transcript records the following exchange:
""DEFENCE COUNSEL:  Your Honour, the concerns that I have in relation to the prejudicial effect that it has on my client namely that this vehicle has been investigated by the police, he's asked questions about it, asked who purchased it off him, obviously the vehicle has attacked (sic - attracted) some police attention.  
HIS HONOUR:  No, he didn't purchase it from --
DEFENCE COUNSEL:  No, how it got there, who left it, doesn't know the name of the person and all those sorts of questions really aren't relevant in relation to this matter.  The only thing that's relevant in relation to this matter is the names."" (bold added)
What can be discerned from counsel's argument, although it was put in a somewhat elliptical or diffuse way, was that she challenged the relevance of the evidence, and also sought to have it excluded by reason of its prejudicial effect.  Despite the deficiencies of the articulation of the argument, it can be seen that the second basis of objection was s 137 of the Evidence Act, which obliges a judge, in a criminal trial, to refuse to admit evidence tendered by the Crown if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
86The trial judge left it to counsel to have some discussions about editing but said that he would give a general ruling, which he did.  He identified the evidence the subject of objection as ""evidence on stolen Jeep"".  He recounted briefly the evidence of the execution of the search warrant, and the location of the drugs, and then said:
""What then happened was that on 22 January, that is three days after the search, the accused arrived at the local police station and makes a statement in connection with occupancy of that room and dealing also with the vehicle that is alleged to be stolen, that is the Jeep.  In that statement he says that he sold his Ute to a person called Colin Stevens.  On 18 January he told the officers, according to them, that he had sold it to somebody called Steven Graham.  The details of Mr Stevens do not coincide with Mr Graham nor his activities nor his whereabouts.
The statement on the 22nd goes on to say that Mr Stevens is a regular visitor and in fact occupied the area upstairs where the drugs were found on a frequent basis and indeed the statement says the drawers, the bunk bed and anything near the stairs belongs to Stevens.  
So the issue clearly is was there another occupant who may have been responsible for the presence of the drugs.""
87He rejected the argument that the evidence was not relevant, and said that it was: 
""... clearly relevant as to who it was that was in that room, if anybody, apart from the accused and given what he has recorded as saying on the 18th and then what he says on the 22nd there is a clear conflict as to who was the purchaser of the Ute."" (bold added)
He then dealt equally briskly with counsel's argument that the evidence was ""unduly prejudicial"" and added:
""And there the matter rests evidentially and the jury will be directed if requested and indeed perhaps even if not requested that any issue about that vehicle is not for them as to whether or not it was stolen and if so to whose knowledge it was stolen, is quite immaterial.  The issue is was the accused in possession of the drugs in the upstairs of that house.  So I cannot see that there is any undue prejudicial effect at this stage.""
88I pause to observe that, contrary to what was said by the trial advocate, when Senior Constable Dickson gave evidence, he did not omit the last question and answer from the recorded interview with the appellant, in which he asked if the appellant was aware that the Jeep had been stolen (to which the appellant gave a negative answer).  Constable Hoffman also gave evidence of having told the appellant that inquiries showed that the registration plates were stolen.  Counsel for the appellant made no protest that this evidence had been given, contrary to the stated intention of the Trial Advocate.  
The appeal
89Sections 5 and 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 permit a person convicted on indictment to appeal, inter alia, on any ground that involves a question of law (such as the wrongful admission of evidence) but also permits this Court to set aside a conviction on the basis of a miscarriage of justice.  Since the ground of appeal is directed solely to the decision to admit the evidence, the correctness of the decision is to be determined by reference to what was before the judge on the voir dire.  (That is not to say that some other point concerning the admission of the evidence could not be raised as a miscarriage of justice, but that was not the subject of any ground of appeal.)
90Counsel who appeared for the appellant on the appeal also had difficulty in identifying with precision the evidence he contended should not have been admitted.  Initially, he confined the argument to paragraphs 4 and 5 of the appellant's 22 January statement.  He then broadened that to include the evidence of the police officers about the visits to the appellant's property on 17 and 18 January, as being ""directly linked"" with paragraphs 4 and 5, and as being ""interrelated"".  That is, effectively, all of the evidence of the 17 and 18 January visits, leaving only the evidence concerning the execution of the search warrant on 19 January.
91In my opinion, the relevant evidence falls into two separate categories, which need to be addressed separately.  The first, and most obvious, is the evidence that showed that the Jeep (on the appellant's premises) was stolen.  As was clear from the position adopted by the Trial Advocate on the voir dire, that evidence could easily have been excised, and, indeed, she signalled her intention to take that course.  That did not, however, happen.
92That there was on the appellant's property a stolen vehicle was of no relevance to the charge of supply of a prohibited drug.  The evidence that suggested that the Jeep was stolen should have been rejected on that basis alone.  Moreover, even if held to have some slight relevance, it had miniscule probative value with respect to the central question, the ownership of the drugs, and was highly prejudicial.  It should have been excluded by reason of s 137 of the Evidence Act.
93A more difficult question concerns the remaining evidence to which appeal counsel referred - the evidence in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the appellant's 22 January statement, and the related evidence of the police officers of the 17 and 18 January visits.
94The central fact in issue in this trial was whether the appellant was in possession of the drugs found in his bedroom, ie whether they were under his control.  In paragraph 6 of his statement he sought to attribute ownership of those drugs to Colin Stevens.  He said that he shared the loft bedroom area with Colin Stevens, when Colin Stevens was in residence; that Stevens came and went, a few days at a time; that Stevens had left the previous Saturday; that the drawers, bunk bed and anything else near the stairs (where the drugs were found) belonged to Stevens; and that his own living area was at the far end of the loft.
95It was legitimate for the Crown to anticipate that he would rely on such an assertion by way of defence, and to seek to meet it.
96Evidence that the appellant had, on a prior occasion, said something inconsistent with that would therefore have been admissible.  But there was no evidence that, on a prior occasion, the appellant had said something inconsistent with that.
97What there was, was evidence that, on a prior occasion, he had said something inconsistent with the contents of paragraph 4.
98Paragraph 4 was directed to an entirely different question - the circumstances in which the stolen Jeep came to be on the property.  The appellant's account was that, in August or September 2009 - the previous year, three to four months earlier - Stevens and Jay White had come to his property, White driving the Jeep.  The two men stayed the night, and White left the following day.  Stevens remained for two to three weeks.  Sometime after he had left, White returned.  The appellant gave some detail that fixed White with proprietorship of the Jeep.  He said that he (the appellant) sold his Holden utility to Stevens, and Stevens and White drove off in it.  
99What the appellant said in this paragraph was, in two respects, inconsistent with what the appellant had told Senior Constable Dickson only three days earlier.  He told Senior Constable Dickson that the person who owned the Jeep was Steven Graham.  And he told Senior Constable Dickson that it was Steven Graham who had bought his Holden utility.
100The Crown therefore sought to adduce the evidence of the inconsistencies in respect of the vehicles as relevant to the assessment of the credibility of the appellant's account of the circumstances of the occupation of the loft bedroom in paragraph 6.  I cannot accept that that was legitimate.  
101That the appellant had given a false account (if it were held to be a false account) to police about the ownership of the Jeep or the circumstances in which it came to be on his property was not relevant to whether he, or Stevens, or somebody else, was in possession of the drugs in the bedroom.  Nor was the evidence of the conflicting accounts the appellant had given of his disposal of the Holden utility.
102As at 22 January, there were, in fact, and certainly in the appellant's mind, two parallel lines of inquiry that might have involved the police.  One concerned the Jeep.  The other concerned the drugs.  There was no evidence of any such line of inquiry concerning the Holden utility.  As is the way with parallels, the two lines did not intersect.  The one had no bearing on the other.  The only way the evidence of the conflict in the appellant's accounts about either vehicle could have been made relevant was as tendency evidence - the tendency of the appellant to give false information to police, or even to invoke (falsely) the name Steven Graham.  The Crown did not tender the evidence on a tendency basis.  Had it done so, it would have had to contend with the exclusionary provisions in ss 97 and 101 of the Evidence Act.
103It may be that the Crown case theory was that the appellant traded the Holden utility for the drugs (see the judgment of Emmett JA at [45]).  If there were evidence to that effect, that might have been sufficient to establish the necessary link between what the appellant said to police about the disposal of the Holden utility, and what he said to police about ownership of the drugs.  But there was, in the material presented to the judge on the voir dire, absolutely nothing to support such a link.  Any such connection was, on the evidence, entirely speculative. 
104Whether the appellant could have been cross-examined on the statements - see s 104 of the Evidence Act - is a different issue, and one that need not, and cannot, here be resolved.
105In my opinion, the objection to the admission of this evidence on the basis of lack of relevance ought to have succeeded.  As with the evidence earlier considered, even if it had some marginal relevance, its probative value (other than as to tendency, for which it was not tendered) was slight and its prejudicial effect substantial.  It was capable of showing the appellant to be a person who was loose with the truth when questioned by police.  It called into question his credibility in respects unrelated to the drug charge.  It ought to have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act.
106I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction.  Notwithstanding the appellant's argument to the contrary, I would order a new trial.  Whether or not there is to be a new trial is a matter that lies properly within the determination of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
107LATHAM J : I have had the advantage of reading Emmett JA's judgment in this matter and I gratefully adopt his Honour's summary of the facts.  My reasons for joining in the orders proposed by his Honour appear below.
108The objection to the evidence on the voir dire was taken before the jury was empanelled. The appellant's counsel at trial submitted that any evidence ""in relation to the Jeep and the names given to the police officers in relation to the Jeep which was stolen .... in 2008"" was inadmissible because it was not relevant to the finding of the drugs within the appellant's house.  The question of the prejudice occasioned by references to a stolen motor vehicle was a secondary aspect to the application.  At no stage during the argument did the appellant's counsel at trial articulate with any greater precision the objectionable evidence by reference to the relevant paragraphs in the statements that were tendered to the trial judge on the voir dire.   
109On the hearing of the appeal, as Emmett JA has noted, the appellant's counsel specified those paragraphs of the police statements and the appellant's statement tendered on the voir dire that were said to be comprehended by the objection.  They are set out in Emmett JA's judgment at [5], [7] and [17].
110There was no objection taken at trial or on the hearing of the appeal to the evidence of Senior Constable Opryszko.  His statement did not form part of the material tendered on the voir dire.  He gave evidence of attending the appellant's premises on 17 January 2010 to enquire about the Holden utility parked in Casino.  On that occasion, the appellant said he had sold the utility several months previously to a person by the name of Stephen Graham.  
111On the following day, when Constable Hoffman and Senior Constable Dickson spoke to the appellant concerning the ownership of the Jeep, the appellant disclosed that Stephen Graham had not only purchased the utility but that he had left the Jeep there at the same time, that the appellant had not seen him since, and that he had no means of contacting him.  Thus, the only information additional to that provided to Senior Constable Opryszko was that the appellant believed that Stephen Graham owned the Jeep and that he was not well known to the appellant.  
112The search of the appellant's home took place the very next day.  Before any search of the loft area was conducted, the appellant indicated that he wished to show Constable Hoffman something.  The appellant took Constable Hoffman to the loft area and pointed out a hypodermic needle and a number of tattooing needles.  It was at this point that the appellant said that it was his bedroom and there was no-one else staying there.  Thereafter, the black tin containing the drugs were found.  The appellant was asked about the pills but declined to comment.
113This chronology is central to an appreciation of the appellant's voluntary statement to police on 22 January.  Had the appellant not proffered the statement, in particular paragraph 6, there was a prima facie case of possession of the drugs by the appellant, based upon his own acknowledgment of sole occupancy of the loft area.  By providing the statement, the appellant sought to rebut that case by the introduction of another occupant of the loft area, namely Colin Stevens.  
114However, the appellant went further than simply nominating Colin Stevens as an occasional resident of the premises.  The appellant's explanation nominated Colin Stevens as the purchaser of his utility on an occasion when Mr Stevens was in the company of Jay White, who drove to the appellant's property in the Jeep.  The appellant's statement in this regard was inconsistent with the information he had provided to police on every previous occasion, namely that it was Stephen Graham (a relative stranger to the appellant) who had purchased the utility and was responsible for the Jeep.
115The Crown was provided with a copy of a statement by Mr Stevens dated 8 June 2011 (which was provided to the trial judge on the voir dire).  The statement asserted that Mr Stevens stayed at the appellant's property from time to time over a number of months, including January 2010, where he shared the loft area with the appellant.  Paragraph 8 of that statement referred to an occasion when Mr Stevens travelled to the appellant's property with Jason White in a Jeep, which was left there.  The statement also claimed that Mr Stevens knew of the presence of drugs in a drawer in the loft area in January 2010, and that the drugs belonged to another person who Mr Stevens declined to name.
116Against this background, it was entirely appropriate for the Crown to seek to tender the appellant's statement of 22 January in its case at trial, in anticipation of evidence in the defence case, either from the appellant or Mr Stevens or both.  The Crown was not only entitled to do so, it was obliged not to split its case.  Given that Mr Stevens' statement claimed ownership of the drugs in another person who had impliedly placed the drugs in the drawer, it was reasonable to anticipate that Mr Stevens' knowledge of that fact could only be explained by reference to an occasion when he was at the appellant's property with that person.  One such occasion was his visit to the appellant in the company of Jay (Jason) White.
117Thus, the appellant's account of the circumstances under which Mr Stevens and Mr White came to stay at the appellant's property in about August or September 2009 was relevant to (in the sense that it could affect, directly or indirectly, the jury's assessment of) the principal fact in issue, namely whether the appellant had exclusive possession of the drugs.   There could be no meaningful assessment of the credibility of that account without a consideration of the appellant's prior inconsistent statements to police on 17 and 18 January concerning the identity of the purchaser of the utility and the owner of the Jeep.  
118As it transpired, Mr Stevens did give evidence to the effect that Jay White was responsible for placing the drugs in the drawer, when they both stayed with the appellant in the loft.  Mr Stevens also maintained that there was only one occasion when Mr White visited the appellant with him, namely, when he drove the Jeep there and purchased the utility.  In his evidence in chief, Mr Stevens said that he had not stayed with the appellant since that night, although he later agreed that his statement asserted that he had stayed with the appellant from time to time in January 2010.  He further stated that he was ""pretty sure"" that Jason White was with him at the appellant's property in January 2010.  This account was also not consistent with the appellant's version of events.
119It was squarely put to the appellant and to Mr Stevens that Jay White did not exist.  Evidence was introduced at trial of the enquiries police made in an effort to locate a Jason White in the age group nominated by the appellant and Mr Stevens, and from the north coast of NSW.  One person fitting that description was found and interviewed, but he denied any knowledge of the appellant or Colin Stevens or of a silver Jeep.  The Crown's position at trial was that the appellant's false account of Mr Stevens' and Mr White's visit to the property in paragraph 4 of the statement of 22 January was adopted by Mr Stevens after the appellant had discussed with him and shown to him a copy of that statement.  
120The course of the trial confirmed what the trial advocate anticipated when the application to exclude the evidence was heard.  The appellant's account in his statement of 22 January of the circumstances surrounding the purchase of his utility and the abandonment of the Jeep was inextricably linked with the explanation proffered to the jury for the presence of the drugs in the drawer in the loft.
121In summary, the application to exclude the evidence was the product of a recognition on the appellant's part that the jury would be less likely to accept his account in his statement as credible (and/or Mr Stevens proposed evidence) if they were aware of earlier inconsistent statements he made to police, concerning the sale of the utility and the origins of the Jeep.  It was the identity of the person to whom he sold the utility, whether it was that same person or another who also left the Jeep at the premises, when that occurred, and under what circumstances which were critical to the credibility of the appellant's defence, not whether the Jeep was stolen to the knowledge of the appellant.
122On the hearing of the appeal, the appellant's counsel devoted a considerable portion of his argument to the proposition that the appellant's prior inconsistent statements to police on 17 and 18 January were wrongly treated as lies going to a consciousness of guilt.  This topic was not raised by anyone at trial until after the summing up, during which the trial judge gave an Edwards direction (Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193) in conventional terms concerning the appellant's admitted lies to police on 17 and 18 January.  Immediately after the summing up concluded, and in the presence of the jury, both counsel for the appellant and the trial advocate confirmed that there was no reliance on lies to prove guilt and that the Crown case had only ever sought to use the statements for the purpose of undermining the credibility of the appellant's account at trial.  The trial judge then said to the jury :-
So really it is getting quite clear that you cannot really use that as evidence of guilt when it is not put forward as it.
123No further direction was sought and no complaint is made on the appeal about the trial judge's directions.  I agree that there is no basis upon which the appellant's admitted lies to police on 17 and 18 January evinced a consciousness of guilt with respect to the appellant's possession of the drugs, in the light of the fact that the drugs were not discovered until 19 January.  The direction ought not have been given, but it was effectively withdrawn and corrected: see Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40 at [34]; 217 CLR 1, at 12.
124There was not, in my view, any danger that the prejudice associated with the police enquiries into a stolen motor vehicle would relevantly outweigh the probative value of the evidence of the conversations between the police and the appellant.  The trial judge gave adequate directions in the course of the summing up :-
[T]here are allegations about motor cars not being lawfully acquired, some having been stolen. That is by the by. This is not a trial about motor cars. Those issues have not been gone into. You have only heard about all of this because of what was said in relation to who was responsible for the motorcars and the initial introduction of Mr Graham.
..............................................................................That is why you have heard about the motorcars but it is very important you should not transfer any concern about motorcars into this issue about drugs, and that is an important thing.
125The appellant's submissions alleging error on the part of the trial judge in failing to have regard to the tendency provisions, the credibility rule and the character provisions in the Evidence Act 1995 are unfounded.  The Crown never sought to use the evidence of the appellant's statements to police as tendency evidence, nor could that have been done.  The credibility rule does not apply, nor is leave required, for the purposes of cross examination of an accused with respect to a prior inconsistent statement: ss 103(1), 104(3)(c). At no stage was it suggested that the appellant was a person of bad character.

2706482,Subramaniam v R [2013] NSWCCA 159,"Judgment

1EMMETT JA : Ms Rajina Subramaniam seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentence imposed by a judge of the District Court on 10 February 2012, in respect of twenty-three offences under s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Crimes Act) and three offences under s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act. She was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 years, with a non-parole period of 7 years, making her eligible for parole on 3 October 2016. 

2Section 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act provides that any person who, by any deception, dishonestly obtains for himself or herself, or another person, any money or valuable or any financial advantage of any kind is liable to imprisonment for five years. Deception is defined as deception by words or conduct, as to fact or as to law. Under s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act, a person who deals with proceeds of crime, knowing that it is proceeds of crime, is guilty of an offence. 

3The principal ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge failed to comply with the provisions of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act), in that his Honour failed to specify how, and on what basis, the aggregate sentence was structured and how he came to his view as to the overall length of sentence. The Crown accepts that his Honour erred in the application of s 53A to the circumstances of the case, and that the Court of Criminal Appeal should embark on the exercise of re-sentencing Ms Subramaniam. 

4Section 53A(1) of the Sentencing Act provides that a court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all, or any two or more, of those offences, instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each. Under s 53A(2), in doing so, the court must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the following matters:

the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed; and 
the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence, after taking into account such matters as are relevant under other provisions of the Sentencing Act, had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. 
However, under s 53A(5), an aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with s 53A(2).

5At the time of the offences, Ms Subramaniam was employed as a senior financial accountant by ING Holdings Australia Ltd (ING). She had been employed by ING for some 20 years. During the period from 16 July 2004 to 24 September 2009, Ms Subramaniam used deception to transfer funds from various corporate accounts of ING either to her own bank accounts or directly into the accounts of others for the purchase of goods, such as jewellery, cosmetics, clothing and furniture. She also used deception to transfer funds to various accounts for the purchase of real estate. During the relevant period, the sum of $45,388,249 was misappropriated. 

6Ms Subramaniam was arrested on 4 October 2009 and has been in custody since then. Against legal advice, she made admissions on the date of her arrest. Ms Subramaniam was subsequently charged with the 26 offences and on 23 June 2011 entered a plea of guilty to all of the offences charged. 

7Some of the funds were given gratuitously to third parties. Some of the goods acquired by Ms Subramaniam were also given away to shop assistants as gifts and some were found under her desk in ING's office still wrapped and unused. Other goods have been given back. The real estate that Ms Subramaniam bought remained unoccupied, except for one case where a person was permitted to stay rent-free. 

8All goods and property that have been located have been seized by ING. Ms Subramaniam entered into a deed of arrangement with ING concerning transfer of the real estate to ING and the sale of the seized items. In addition, property held by Ms Subramaniam and her husband, not related to the deception, was also transferred to ING. Ms Subramaniam assisted ING in their investigations. Despite those arrangements, full reparation had not been made at the time of the sentence proceedings and a substantial shortfall still exists. 

9The accepted error on the part of the sentencing judge was his Honour's failure to indicate the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence, had separate sentences been imposed, instead of an aggregate sentence. His Honour attached a schedule to his remarks on sentencing, in which he grouped the offences charged according to the bank accounts into which misappropriated funds had been transferred. Putting aside the offences under s 193B(2), his Honour described five groups. Section 53A does not remove the obligation of a sentencing judge to provide reasons for the structure of aggregation of the sentence, and it is difficult to see a rational basis for such a grouping, having regard to the disparate amounts transferred into each account. 

10The extent of the misappropriations by Ms Subramaniam is quite extraordinary. She engaged in deceptive conduct over a long period and the amounts involved were very substantial. That signifies criminality of a very high order. 

11I have read in draft form the reasons of Latham J. I agree with her Honour's conclusion that, in the circumstances of this case referred to by her Honour, Ms Subramaniam's moral culpability should be reduced moderately. I also agree that Ms Subramaniam is entitled to a discount of 25% in recognition of her early pleas of guilty and that her extensive cooperation with the authorities indicates the extent of her remorse and contrition. Further, I agree that Ms Subramaniam's prospects of rehabilitation are good and that little purpose would be served by a sentence that reflected personal deterrence. In addition, having regard to Ms Subramaniam's personality disorder, described by Latham J, general deterrence has less significance than it might in another case. 

12Finally, I agree with the grouping of offences proposed by Latham J. That is to say, the grouping of the offences under s 178BA according to their seriousness by reference to the amounts involved makes much more sense than the grouping adopted by the sentencing judge. While there is a degree of arbitrariness involved in identifying separate groups of offences, the following groupings adopted by Latham J are clearly appropriate:

13 transfers of less than $1,000,000 totalling $3,000,000; 
4 transfers ranging from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000, totalling $7,000,000; 
3 transfers ranging from $2,000,000 to $5,000,000, totalling $10,500,000; 
2 transfers ranging from $5,000,000 to less than $8,000,000, totalling $13,500,000; and 
a transfer of over $12,000,000.
The final group is for the three offences under s 193B(2). They involve amounts of $5,100,00, $6,600,000 and $5,800,000, although there is a degree of technicality involved in those offences, since they involve the same funds that are subject to the offences under s 178BA. 

13I agree with Latham J, for the reasons given by her Honour, that an aggregate non-parole period of 6 years, to date from 4 October 2009, with a balance of 5 years expiring on 3 October 2020, is the appropriate sentence. Ms Subramaniam would then be eligible for release on 4 October 2015.

14SIMPSON J : I agree with Latham J.

15LATHAM J : The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence that was imposed upon her on 10 February 2012, following pleas of guilty to 23 counts of obtain benefit by deception pursuant to s 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900 and 3 counts of dealing with proceeds of crime (money laundering) pursuant to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act. 

16The obtain benefit by deception offences each carry a maximum penalty of 5 years' imprisonment. The money laundering offences each carry a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment. The sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which resulted in a non-parole period of seven (7) years with a balance of term of eight (8) years.

17The Crown concedes that the sentencing judge erred in his application of s 53A to the facts of the case and that this Court should embark upon a re-sentencing exercise. It is unnecessary to canvass in any detail the remaining grounds of the appeal relating to the applicant's mental condition and the extent of the discount for the pleas of guilty. 

The Offences

18The applicant was employed for 20 years with ING Holdings Australia Ltd as a senior financial accountant. Between 16 July 2004 and 24 September 2009 the applicant used various dishonest means to transfer funds from various ING corporate accounts to either her own bank accounts or directly into the bank accounts of other institutions for the purchase of luxury goods, including jewellery, cosmetics, clothing and furniture. The applicant also transferred large amounts of money for the purpose of purchasing real estate. Eight properties were purchased in the applicant's name or in her maiden name to the combined value of $17 million. 

19In addition, the applicant gave money as gifts to various people, including shop assistants with whom the applicant became friendly as a result of her frequent expensive purchases. One of these people received the sum of $1.3 million to assist her in the purchase of a property, whilst another received $240,000.00. 

20The total expenditure over the five-year period amounted to $45,388,249.00. This amount is reflected in the obtain benefit by deception offences. The three money laundering offences relate to the purchase of real estate. All of the properties, but for one, remained empty. The one property which was occupied was provided by the applicant rent-free.

21The applicant took very few steps to conceal her offending. Very large sums of money were transferred into various accounts in her own name or to retailers who were provided by the applicant with her e-mail address at her place of employment. The applicant was able to access the ING corporate accounts by using the security details of former employees of ING.

22Most of the luxury goods purchased by the applicant were found under the applicant's desk, wrapped and unused, in storage boxes. Some of the purchased items had been given as gifts to shop assistants, particularly at Paspaley where the applicant was well known.

23The applicant was arrested on 4 October 2009 following an audit by KPMG and the discovery of many boxes containing luxury goods underneath the applicant's workstation. The applicant made full admissions against legal advice on the day of her arrest. Her husband was ignorant of her offending. The applicant claimed that her behaviour was attributable to sexual abuse during her childhood and a degree of resentment that she harboured against certain people at work.

24All of the goods and property the subject of the offences were seized by ING. After her arrest the applicant entered into a deed of arrangement with ING as to the transfer of the properties and the sale of the seized items. Property belonging to the applicant and her husband which was not related to the fraud was also transferred to ING. The applicant assisted ING in their investigations to the fullest extent. The applicant pleaded guilty on 23 June 2011 at Central Local Court. 

25The parties agreed at the hearing of the appeal that the net loss to ING is slightly less than half of the total sum.

The Approach to Sentencing under s 53A

26Section 53A relevantly provides :-

(1) A court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.
(2) A court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under this section on an offender must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the following: 
(a) the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed, 
(b) the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 or any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. 
(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

27The most often overlooked aspect of the provision is subsection (2)(b). In R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199, Grove AJ (Macfarlan JA and McCallum J agreeing) cautioned against a ""blanket assessment"" of each offence. The imposition of the same sentence for a number of offences, each of which differs in criminality, may demonstrate a failure to comply with the fundamental principles of sentencing which were preserved by s 53A(2)(b) : see New South Wales Legislative Council, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard), 23 November 2010 at 27867.

28In R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219, McClellan CJ at CL (Hall and Hulme JJ agreeing) pointed out that the terms of s 53A(2) requires the sentencing judge to give consideration to the criminality involved in each offence and, where appropriate, have regard to any matters on a Form 1 when defining the sentence that would have been imposed for an individual offence. The four reasons underlying that requirement were identified by Hulme J at [58] as its importance for the application of the totality principle, the exposure of the sentencing exercise in the event of appellate review, the demonstration to victims and the general public of the gravity with which the offences are regarded and its contribution to an assessment of a new aggregate sentence in the event that any of the underlying convictions are quashed on appeal. 

29The sentencing judge in the instant case failed to adhere to this approach, despite adverting to the totality principle. The judge imposed a uniform sentence of two years and one month (following the application of the discount for the pleas of guilty and the applicant's co-operation) with respect to each offence, notwithstanding significant variations in the amounts of money the subject of the deceptions in each case and notwithstanding the fact that the money laundering offences carried a maximum penalty three times greater than the obtain benefit by deception offences. 

30The sentencing remarks reveal that the judge grouped the offences by reference to the bank accounts into which the funds were paid. The six groupings were :-

(i)Six of the obtain benefit by deception offences that resulted in an amount of $2,096,000.00 being paid into an ANZ account.

(ii)Seven of the obtain benefit by deception offences that resulted in an amount of $14,238,000.00 being paid into a St George account.

(iii)One obtain benefit by deception offence that resulted in the payment of $585,000.00 into a Westpac account.

(iv)One obtain benefit by deception offence that resulted in the payment of $12,500.00 into a Commonwealth account.

(v)Seven obtain benefit by deception offences that resulted in the sum of $26,950,000.00 being paid into various retail and trading accounts.

(vi)Three money laundering offences and one obtain property by deception offence with respect to an amount of $10,410,000.00.


31The judge stated :-
Whilst I have regard to the maximum sentence that can be imposed for all the offences, sentences for each offence will be of a similar order. There must be some accumulation to take account of the fact that there were so many offences and I must have regard to the fact that the principle of totality requires that I impose a sentence that in the circumstances is not too severe.
........................................................................
In my opinion, it would be appropriate to make sentences concerning each bank account partly concurrent and partly cumulative and to make each group of offences partly concurrent and partly cumulative.
............................................................................
The overall sentence will be 15 years' imprisonment, but with a non-parole period of seven years.

32It is not apparent from the sentencing remarks which group of offences represented by each of the six categories were either partially accumulated or made partially concurrent with any other group. That in itself does not necessarily contravene s 53A. However, given the very disparate criminality represented by the offending within each group, having regard to the total sum deposited in each relevant bank account, the application of normal sentencing principles would ordinarily result in a different aggregate sentence with respect to each group. There is nothing in the remarks on sentence that provides any insight into that calculation.

33In addition, the offences represented by (vi) do not sit easily with one another or with the remaining offences in each of the other five groups. The criminality inherent in the money laundering offences significantly overlapped with the criminality represented by the offences in (ii) and (v). The offences in (ii) and (v) consisted of the fraudulent transfer of funds from ING accounts to the St George Bank and to three trust accounts, all relating to the purchase of properties, the subject of the money laundering offences. 

34Thus, the money laundering offences came within the type of ""highly technical"" category of this offence that was identified by Howie J (Campbell JA and Rothman J agreeing) in Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294 at [31]. As in Thorn, the applicant was doing no more than ""merely transferring the money obtained by the fraudulent claims from the company accounts to [her] personal account ...... so that [she] could use it to [purchase property]. [She] was doing nothing to hide the source or to change the nature of the funds. [She] was simply gaining access to them.""

35The criminality represented by the money laundering offences was of a low order for this reason and there ought to have been very little, if any, accumulation on the sentences imposed for the obtain benefit by deception offences in groups (ii) and (v). It is not possible to say whether that occurred or whether the sentence for the offences in (vi) added materially to the sentence for group (ii) and/or (v). 

36It is appropriate in my view to approach re-sentencing on the basis that the obtain financial benefit offences involving the transfer of funds of a similar order ought be grouped together. The greater the amount comprehended by each group of offences, the greater the penalty, both with respect to each offence within the group and with respect to the aggregate sentence for the combination of offences. The penalties for the money laundering offences ought be wholly concurrent with the sentences for the s 178BA offences. This does not signify that there is no additional criminality inherent in the money laundering offences (albeit at the low end of the scale), but it recognises that partial accumulation of the sentences imposed for each of the proposed groups is sufficient for the purposes of totality. 

The Applicant's Subjective Case

37The applicant was born in Fiji of Indian parents on 15 May 1969. She grew up with her family in Nadi before emigrating to Australia in 1977. Her parents are both retired. She has two older sisters both of whom are married with children and one younger brother, married with one child. Her parents continue to reside in Blacktown.

38The applicant met her husband shortly after commencing employment at ING. He was also an accountant with the firm. They married in 1992. In about 2006 the applicant's husband left ING to work for a subsidiary company in North Sydney. The applicant and her husband enjoy an ongoing supportive relationship.

39The applicant was educated to HSC standard following which she attended TAFE where she obtained her diploma in accountancy. After a few casual jobs, the applicant joined ING in 1989, initially as an accounts clerk for about five or six years, then as an assistant accountant for 10 years. She was promoted to financial accountant for a further three years. When her husband left the position of senior financial accountant the applicant took that position in 2006. She initially supervised four staff, which was later reduced to two.

40The applicant's duties generally involved payroll accounting, directors' fees, reconciliations and accounts payable. The applicant's former senior manager left the company in about 2008 and was replaced by a new senior manager who failed to communicate adequately with the applicant. According to the applicant, her senior manager's attitude towards the department, the applicant's work and that of her staff engendered in her a high degree of stress. She wanted redundancy but was never offered it. According to the applicant, her salary was not as great as that of her husband when he occupied the same position. Ultimately, her senior manager reduced her staff to one over the applicant's objections.

41The applicant disclosed a history of sexual abuse by her paternal grandfather in Fiji and in Australia. The abuse was said to have occurred over a number of years from about the age of 7 to about the age of 12. The abuse stopped when her grandparents moved to Melbourne. The abuse was constituted by oral sex and vaginal digital penetration. The applicant did not tell her parents, although she did tell her husband prior to their marriage. Her husband suggested that she consult a psychologist in Macquarie Street. The applicant attended on a number of occasions but discontinued when she found the sessions too difficult.

42In addition, the applicant said that she had been subjected to sexual abuse by one of the senior managers in ING over a number of years. The applicant claimed that the senior manager had sexual intercourse with her on a number of occasions and that she complied with his wishes because she was afraid that her husband would suffer if she did not. In fact, the applicant's husband, the applicant and the senior manager (who was a close friend of the applicant's husband) previously engaged in group sexual activity during the applicant's husband's employment at ING. Sexual activity between the applicant and the senior manger continued after the applicant's husband left the company, unbeknown to him. During this period of time she felt humiliated and shamed and became immensely depressed.

43The applicant initially attempted to explain her offending in part by reference to the appearance of a number of Indian men outside the ING building in about 2004 who engaged her in conversation. These Indian men told her that they wanted to change her future and spiritual path and that they were feeding hungry people in India. She said that they included Sheiks who wore turbans and who were gurus. She said that they would come 3 to 4 times a year but in different groups. They would call her at work and she would go downstairs to meet them. They had various names and she would sit with them for 5 to 10 minutes, talking. She began to give them money of her own, but after a few months she gave them money fraudulently acquired from other accounts. She felt as if their needs were greater than her own. Over time they started asking for more money and the applicant felt threatened and intimidated by them. It is not suggested that these demands were directly linked to the applicant's escalating frauds after 2004.

44According to a psychologist, Anita Duffy, the applicant's extravagant spending provided her with a sense of importance and self respect. The applicant's relationships with the staff of the retail outlets allowed her to escape the stress and despair that she felt in the workplace.

45The applicant was examined a number of times by Drs Westmore and Allnutt. To both of these psychiatrists and to a psychologist, the applicant provided further details regarding the visits of the Indian men, their appearance and the nature of their demands. Doctors Westmore and Allnutt concluded that the applicant's account of these interactions was not typical of a psychosis, rather they were indicative of pseudo-hallucinations suggestive of a schizo typal personality trait. The applicant was ""likely manifesting depressive symptoms of variable severity during the period of the offending."" Otherwise, the applicant did not manifest any major medical problems.

46In Dr Allnutt's report of 4 October 2011, he described the applicant as manifesting ""relatively inflexible and pervasive personality traits that .. caused significant impairment in her social and occupational functioning; she does not fall into any particular personality diagnostic category, but does manifest a number of traits from various categories of personality disorder"". Dr Allnutt confirmed that he considered schizo typal personality traits as a possibility given her description of her experiences with certain religious people that she met. Predominately, the applicant manifested the combination of borderline and dependent personality traits.

47In relation to the applicant's interactions with the Indian men, Dr Allnutt thought that they could be pseudo-psychotic symptoms derived from her personality disorder, or a transient psychotic episode or an actual experience of individuals that the applicant met and ""misperceived"", or that they were a fabrication on her part. Dr Allnutt was unable to determine which of these applied.

48The applicant's sexual abuse in childhood was considered material in the development of the applicant's personality disorder. According to Dr Allnutt's evidence during the sentencing proceedings, there was on the balance of probabilities a causal relationship between the applicant's personality disorder and the offending.

49That there was such a relationship was not disputed by the Crown. The only contentious aspect was the extent to which the sentence ought be ameliorated to take account of that factor. 

The Applicant's Co-operation

50On the hearing of the appeal, the applicant contended that the sentencing judge had afforded an inadequate discount for the applicant's pleas of guilty and her ""assistance"" to authorities. This submission was prompted by the quantification of ""an overall discount of 30%"" by the judge, in recognition of the pleas and her extensive co-operation with the authorities, evidenced in part by the liquidation of property belonging to herself and her husband, unrelated to the fraud. 

51The applicant's submissions on sentence did not seek a quantified discount for her co-operation. Rather, the submissions correctly recognised that restitution was a feature of the applicant's remorse. The applicant referred to Phelan v R (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 ; R v Giallussi [1999] NSWCCA 56 and R v Strano [2002] NSWCCA 531, all of which confirm that restitution can be a mitigating factor where it involves a degree of sacrifice. To those decisions may be added R v Conway [2001] NSWCCA 51 ; 121 A Crim R 177, Thewlis v R [2008] NSWCCA 176 and Job v R [2011] NSWCCA 267. 

52Whether restitution is properly confined to considerations of contrition and remorse, or whether it is ameliorative conduct deserving of separate consideration in circumstances where it results in hardship to the offender and/or the offender's family (as Thewlis and Job suggest), it is clear that it does not warrant the allocation of a quantified discount : R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32] ; 195 A Crim R 1. 

53In the circumstances of this case, I am of the view that the applicant's efforts to ameliorate the consequences of her offending are an expression of her remorse. Those efforts included :-

(a)The execution of Powers of Attorney and transfers in relation to the properties and jewellery purchased by the applicant.

(b)The transfer to ING of properties in Waitara and Wahroonga in which the applicant held an interest which was unrelated to her offending.

(c)Assistance to ING in their investigations, including participating in interviews with ING and with investigators.

54The transfer of the interest in the properties unrelated to the offending deprived the applicant and her husband of investment properties. I accept that the applicant and her husband will not enjoy the financial security they had planned, but they remain in possession of the family home. To that extent, it is not entirely accurate to say that there was no more that the applicant could have done to make restitution. However, the applicant's remorse and contrition are genuine and complete.

Re-Sentencing

55The scale of the frauds committed by the applicant is breathtaking. The longevity of her conduct and the amount of money fraudulently obtained signifies criminality of a very high order. It must however be acknowledged that the applicant's offending was bizarre in nature. She made no real attempt to disguise the transactions whereby she deposited staggering amounts of money into her own accounts ; she repeatedly purchased the most expensive jewellery and luxury goods from the same retailers and provided them with her work email address ; she made no attempt to use or derive income from any of the property she purchased ; none of the items purchased were used by her, other than as gifts to virtually casual acquaintances ; the ""gift"" of $1.3 million to a shop assistant was, in itself, peculiar.

56The applicant's senior counsel on the hearing of the appeal contended that the applicant's personality disorder necessarily reduced the objective gravity of the offences. The question whether the applicant's mental condition is a factor in the assessment of the objective gravity of the offences is a vexed one. This Court has not, to date, reached a concluded view on that controversy since the decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39 : see Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49 per Hulme J at [27] to [36]. The High Court in Muldrock confined the objective gravity of an offence to ""the nature of the offending"". 

57For my part, attributes personal to the applicant (in particular, her mental state at the time of offending) more appropriately belong to an assessment of moral culpability. Such personal attributes ought be distinguished from the objective features of the offences, namely, the acts and the fault element constituting the offences. I acknowledge what Price J said (Allsop JA and Campbell J agreeing) in Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [40] to [42], about the scope of the expression ""the nature of the offending"" in so far as it may not be correct to confine it to the ingredients of an offence. I would agree with Price J that the partial defence of provocation is properly considered as an aspect of objective gravity, not least because it qualifies the fault element of an offence. 

58The impact of the applicant's personality disorder on the sentencing exercise is a complex issue. I am not persuaded that the applicant was incapable of appreciating the wrongfulness of her actions, such that her moral culpability for the offending ought be substantially reduced : Muldrock at [54]. The fact that there was an element of revenge in her offending, directed at those who the applicant perceived had mistreated her, suggests that she understood and desired that those persons in ING would be brought into disrepute by their failure to detect her offending. However, it appears that the causal relationship between her mental disorder and the offending lay in the applicant's compromised intellectual and emotional restraints. In these circumstances, a finding that the applicant's moral culpability is moderately reduced is justified. 

59The applicant is entitled to a discount of 25% on the sentences to be imposed in recognition of her early pleas of guilty. As I have already noted, her extensive co-operation with the authorities is testimony to her remorse and contrition. The applicant's prospects of rehabilitation are sound and there is no purpose to be served by the imposition of a sentence that reflects personal deterrence. General deterrence, retribution and denunciation have less significance because of the applicant's personality disorder, although commensurate with the moderate reduction in the applicant's moral culpability, there is still some scope for the sentence to reflect those principles.

60Sequences 8 to 12, 14 to 16, 21, 22, 24, 25 and 27 each involved the fraudulent transfer of amounts less than $1 million. In all, about $3 million was obtained by the applicant from these offences. A fixed term of one year imprisonment ought be imposed for each of these offences, to be served wholly concurrently with each other.

61Sequences 13, 17, 19 and 37 each involved the fraudulent transfer of amounts ranging between $1 million and $2 million. A total of about $7 million was obtained by the applicant from these offences. A sentence of 18 months' imprisonment ought be imposed for each of these offences, with some partial accumulation resulting in an aggregate sentence of 2 years' imprisonment for this group of offences.

62Sequences 18, 26 and 28 each involved the fraudulent transfer of amounts between $2 million and $5 million. A total of $10.5 million was obtained by the applicant from these offences. A sentence of 30 months' imprisonment ought be imposed for each of these offences, with some partial accumulation resulting in an aggregate sentence of 3 years' imprisonment for this group of offences.

63Sequences 20 and 23 each involved the fraudulent transfer of amounts between $5 million and $12 million. A total of $13.5 million was obtained by the applicant from these offences. A sentence of 3 years' imprisonment ought be imposed for each of these offences, with some partial accumulation resulting in an aggregate sentence of 4 years' imprisonment for this group of offences.

64Sequence 29 involved the fraudulent transfer of over $12 million. A sentence of 3 years and 9 months' imprisonment ought be imposed for this offence.

65Sequence 30 is a money laundering offence that diverted $5.1 million in September and October of 2009 towards the purchase of three properties at Kirribilli. Sequence 32 is a money laundering offence that diverted $6.6 million in August of 2009 towards the purchase of two properties in Sydney and Bondi. Sequence 34 is a money laundering offence that diverted $5.8 million in September of 2009 towards the purchase of three properties in Bondi. A sentence of 3 years and 9 months' imprisonment ought be imposed for each of these offences, wholly concurrent with each other. 

66The Crown took no issue with a finding of special circumstances. The applicant's personality disorder, in particular the long-term effects of her childhood sexual abuse, will require treatment in the context of her return to her marriage and to her family. 

67Taking all of these matters into account, I propose the following orders:

The appeal is allowed

The sentence imposed on 10 February 2012 is quashed

In lieu impose an aggregate non-parole period of six (6) years to date from 4 October 2009, expiring 3 October 2015, with a balance of term of five (5) years, expiring 3 October 2020. The applicant would be eligible for release on 4 October 2015.

2706484,HAMZY v R [2013] NSWCCA 156,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Nature of ProceedingsThe applicant seeks leave to appeal against the decision of Zahra DCJ on 10 May 2013 in which his Honour refused to continue a suppression and non-publication order under the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (the Act).
2The applicant filed an application for leave to appeal on 13 May 2013.  The appeal is brought pursuant to s14(1) of the Act.
Factual Background
3On 10 May 2013 the primary judge was sentencing the applicant (who had pleaded guilty) for two offences:
(1) Between 5 May 2008 and 11 June 2008 at Lithgow in the State of New South Wales supplied a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug.
(2) On 5 June 2008 in Adelaide in the State of South Australia, while in the company of another person, detained John Baroutas without his consent and with intent to obtain an advantage, namely a financial advantage.
Count 1 was laid under s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  The maximum penalty for that offence was life imprisonment.  The offence carried a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  Count 2 was laid under s86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
4The primary judge was also asked to take into account 15 further offences on a Form 1.
5During the proceedings on sentence, which commenced on 27 April 2012, an application was made by the applicant's then counsel for a non-publication order of the applicant's evidence.  It was indicated that the application was based on the applicant's fears (proceedings on sentence 27.4.2012, p 1.42 - 2.5).  There was no objection to this order by the Crown.
6The primary judge indicated that he needed to satisfy himself that it was necessary to make the non-publication order sought.  He referred to the issue of national security concerning evidence touching upon certain stolen rocket launchers.  The primary judge indicated that based on the state of the material before him at that time, an issue of national security might be relevant.
7The primary judge said:
SUPPRESSED
8SUPPRESSED
9The proceedings on sentence continued on other days.  On both 5 and 9 April 2013 the applicant appeared and made submissions on sentence on his own behalf, although Mr Abbas, his solicitor, was present.  Towards the end of the proceedings on 9 April 2013 the issue of the continuation of the suppression order was discussed:
""HIS HONOUR:  Yes well the question of the suppression order is a matter that I was just about to raise Mr Crown because there is a suppression order obviously because of the nature of some of the evidence in this trial and that order was made obviously because of the sensitivity of investigations in relation to the rocket launchers.  Now having heard all the evidence, I don't know whether there is in fact a foundation for any suppression order in relation or continuation of the suppression.
CROWN:  Does your Honour wish that to form part of the submissions from the Crown?
HIS HONOUR:  Yes.  In other words that was a matter that I was about to raise Mr Crown.  If a further suppression order is sought or continuation of the suppression order to cover obviously my Remarks on Sentence.  
CROWN:  Yes your Honour.
HIS HONOUR:  It may be that if you're able to include that in your written submission but it may be ultimately once I hand down the sentence obviously depending on the matters I raise in the Remarks on Sentence it may be that there might be a further application.  But it does appear to me on the face of it that there is no continuing inquiry in relation to the matter so far as Mr Hamzy is concerned and I don't know whether my referring to the evidence of this trial would be such that it form the basis of a suppression order in any event.
OFFENDER:  Your Honour may I make submissions with regard to that as well?
HIS HONOUR:  Yes I was about to come back to you Mr Hamzy on that issue.  You need to turn your mind obviously to the provisions of the various sections there.  Yes thanks Mr Crown.  Mr Hamzy the Crown will provide written submissions in relation to whether the continuation of the suppression order is sought.  If you want to make submissions in that regard, if you could make written submissions again.  If you want to make further oral submissions again, I'm happy to list the matter before me but that's a matter you would need to address also.
OFFENDER:  Can you just explain to me your Honour what that actually means?
HIS HONOUR:  Yes.  There is presently a suppression order.  A suppression order was made because of what was believed at the start of the trial that the issues in the trial would relate to sensitive matters of a current investigation or an investigation in relation to the rocket launchers and I made an order closing the court, and as you would be aware, the proceedings up until now proceeded by way of closed court.  However, I need to revisit that in the context of the sentencing proceedings that have taken place and whether there is to be an application for a continuation of the suppression orders that I have made, in other words, that any evidence during the course of the proceedings, whether an order is sought to suppress any information in relation to that.  You might also consider whether you want to make submissions in relation to whether there should be a suppression order.  Mr Abbas are you able to provide some assistance with Mr Hamzy for the various legislative provisions?
ABBAS:  I will your Honour.
HIS HONOUR:  Mr Abbas will be able to give you some advice in that regard.
OFFENDER:  I will be making submissions your Honour for the continuation of the suppression order your Honour so if I could just flag that with your Honour now.
HIS HONOUR:  Yes I understand from matters that you've raised with me previously that that suppression order relates to any issue relating to assistance with the authorities is that the case?
OFFENDER:  Yes and public interest immunity on the agreements that were made your Honour.""  (POS 9.4.13 - 33.26)
10Written submissions on both sentence and the suppression order were served by the Crown in April 2013.  The Crown did not seek to extend the orders previously made.  The Crown submitted that there was no basis for the court to conclude that any of the grounds set out in s8 of the Act were satisfied.
11The applicant prepared three pages of handwritten submissions addressing why a suppression order should be made.  The applicant relied upon:
National interest.
Ensure the safety of any person.
Protect a particular witness from distress.
In the public interest.
Most of the applicant's submissions addressed safety concerns in a general way without reference to specific concerns.
12The matter came back before the primary judge on 10 May 2013.  Mr Abbas, solicitor, appeared again for the applicant with the applicant making his own submissions.  The applicant confirmed that he sought an extension of the suppression order.  There was a lengthy exchange between the judge and the applicant wherein the judge indicated that he had received the written submissions, but was of the view that there existed no basis to make the order.  His Honour said that there was no longer an issue of national security and there was no evidence to suggest there were safety issues for any person (POS 10.5.2013 - 3.18).
13SUPPRESSED 
14SUPPRESSED
15The judge indicated that he did not propose to make a suppression order (POS 10.5.2013 - 5.9).
16The judge then delivered his Remarks on Sentence in open court.  His Honour made the non-publication and suppression orders, to which he had previously referred.  SUPPRESSED 
17At about 3pm on 10 May 2013 the Australian Broadcasting Commission (the ABC) published an article online called ""Australia's Highest Security Inmate to Remain in Jail"" (ABC article).  The ABC article published a report of the sentence proceedings before the primary judge.
18After the sentence proceedings, the applicant's legal advisers made an urgent application to the Court of Appeal.  At that time the applicant was seeking a suppression order primarily on the basis that such an order was necessary to protect his safety (s8(1)(c) of the Act).  That application came before Basten JA.  Basten JA was not persuaded to make an interim suppression order on that basis, although his Honour did make a suppression order in relation to the transcript and evidence in the sentence proceedings.  Save for that order, the application was dismissed (In an application by Bassam Hamzy [2013] NSWCA 121).
19At about 5pm on 10 May 2013, after having been notified of the Court of Appeal suppression order, the ABC article was removed.
20On 14 May 2013 the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal made interim orders in the following terms:
""That the suppression orders and non-publication orders made by his Honour Judge Peter Zahra SC on 25 July 2011 and 27 April 2012 be continued until further order of the court.""
On 17 May 2013 Basten JA revoked the suppression order which he had previously made (Hamzy v District Court of NSW [2013] NSWCA 130).
21The applicant's application for leave to appeal from the order of the primary judge raised three grounds of appeal:
Ground 1:  His Honour denied the applicant procedural fairness in circumstances where the court had previously indicated that the ""removal"" of the suppression order would be considered at a later date, after sentence had been passed, yet the Court refused to extend the order on the date on which sentence was passed.
Ground 2:  His Honour erred in failing to give sufficient reasons, when refusing to extend the orders made.
Ground 3:  His Honour erred in failing to give any weight whatsoever to the matters raised by the applicant in his handwritten submissions of 7 May 2013.
22The applicant's legal advisers sought leave to rely upon additional evidence which was to be provided at the hearing of the application pursuant to s14(5) of the Act.
23Although the Court of Criminal Appeal made its interim orders on 14 May 2013, the matter did not come before the court for hearing until Thursday, 13 June 2013.  The DPP opposed the applicant's application, as did the ABC, which had intervened in the proceedings.
24SUPPRESSED 
25On behalf of the DPP, statements were provided by senior police officers to the effect that the police did not regard the applicant as having useful information to provide concerning either the theft of rocket launchers, and their whereabouts, or other weapons and that he was attempting to hold out the prospect of assistance to the authorities for his own advantage.
26There was an affidavit relied on by the ABC which set out the content of the article, published online at 3pm on 10 May 2013, and which also identified other information in the public arena concerning the applicant, in particular the contents of an article published on 29 July 2011 which was entitled ""Jailed jihadist tries for deal on stolen rocket launchers"" which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald.
The application for leave to appeal
27SUPPRESSED 
28A senior police officer gave evidence to the effect that retribution of the sort described by the applicant could be administered to persons even though they were in prison and even though they were being detained in conditions of high security.
29SUPPRESSED 
30In relation to the three grounds of appeal, the submissions on behalf of the applicant were as follows.  
Ground 1
31The applicant relied upon an exchange of correspondence between his solicitors and the primary judge as misleading him into thinking that he would be given an opportunity to put arguments in favour of continuing the suppression order on a date other than the date on which the sentence would be handed down.  The correspondence relied upon was an email of 7 May 2013 from the primary judge's associate to the applicant's solicitors:
""His Honour has asked me to indicate that he intends to pass sentence on Friday.  His Honour will continue the suppression order, however, the application by the Crown to remove the suppression order will be adjourned to another day as Mr Hamzy's father needs to be notified.""
On 8 May, the solicitors for the applicant responded:
""In relation to the submissions with respect to the suppression and non-publication orders, if his Honour is satisfied Mr Hamzy's current submissions are sufficient, please let us know.  If not, Mr Hamzy intends on supplementing them at a later stage before his Honour sets down a date for the suppression/non-publication argument.""
On 9 May, the primary judge's associate responded:
""In regards to Mr Hamzy's submissions on the suppression orders, they are sufficient and his Honour does not require him to address anything further.""
32The applicant submitted that it was clear from that exchange that the suppression order would continue in effect beyond the imposition of the sentence until such time as a full debate could occur.  He submitted that there was no suggestion that the matter would be fully argued on 10 May.  In that regard, he had been deprived of procedural fairness.
33The applicant submitted that the primary judge's error was perpetuated by his refusal at the time of handing down sentence to continue the suppression and non-publication orders so as to allow the applicant an opportunity to review his Honour's determination, either by way of a review under s13 or an appeal under s14 of the Act.
Ground 2
34The applicant submitted that when refusing to extend the suppression and non-publication orders, the primary judge had merely stated that there was no longer a concern for national security and accordingly the orders would not be extended.  The applicant submitted that the primary judge had said nothing about his safety, or that of his family.  The applicant submitted that although the orders had originally been made on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so, the primary judge had not stated why that situation had changed so that such considerations no longer applied.  The applicant submitted that the failure to provide proper reasons constituted error, as well as a denial of procedural fairness.
Ground 3
35The applicant submitted that his Honour's failure to make any reference to his handwritten submissions in his reasons for refusing to extend the suppression and non-publication orders gave rise to a strong inference that he had given those submissions little or no weight.  The applicant submitted that at the very least, the primary judge should have indicated why it was that he had concluded that because of the evidence which he had given, neither the applicant nor his family were at risk and that an order was not necessary to protect their safety.
Consideration
36The nature of the appeal provided by s14 of the Act was referred to by Bathurst CJ in Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand Pty Ltd v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125 where his Honour said:
""6 The nature of an appeal depends on the construction of the particular statutory provisions by which the right of appeal is conferred: Coal and Allied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission [2000] HCA 47; (2000) 203 CLR 194 at [11]; Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Limited [2008] HCA 13; (2008) 234 CLR 124 at [2].  In the present case the wide powers to admit not only additional evidence but also substituted evidence, coupled with the fact that, subject to leave, a review under s 13 and an appeal under s 14 appear to be alternatives, lead me to the conclusion that the hearing on the appeal is a hearing de novo.
7 As Basten JA has pointed out, as a practical matter, problems which could arise as a result of this construction can be controlled by the imposition of conditions on leave to appeal. Although the question of leave will depend upon each particular case, it is likely that in cases involving a reconsideration of an order on fresh or different evidence leave will commonly be refused and the applicant left to exercise his or her right of review.""
37Given the delay which had already occurred between the date when sentence was handed down and when the matter came on for hearing, the Court determined to hear the additional evidence and to take that additional evidence into account when dealing with the application.  There was, as the ABC stressed, some urgency in determining whether the interim suppression and non-publication orders should be continued.  It submitted (with some justification) that the continuation for a substantial period of an interim suppression and non-publication order would of itself defeat the primary objective of achieving ""open justice"".
38Apart from the right of appeal, the relevant sections of the Act are:
""6   Safeguarding public interest in open justice
In deciding whether to make a suppression order or non-publication order, a court must take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice.
7   Power to make orders
A court may, by making a suppression order or non-publication order on grounds permitted by this Act, prohibit or restrict the publication or other disclosure of:
(a)   information tending to reveal the identity of or otherwise concerning any party to or witness in proceedings before the court or any person who is related to or otherwise associated with any party to or witness in proceedings before the court, or
(b)   information that comprises evidence, or information about evidence, given in proceedings before the court.
8   Grounds for making an order
(1)   A court may make a suppression order or non-publication order on one or more of the following grounds:
(a)   the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice,
(b)   the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory in relation to national or international security,
(c)   the order is necessary to protect the safety of any person,
(d)   the order is necessary to avoid causing undue distress or embarrassment to a party to or witness in criminal proceedings involving an offence of a sexual nature (including an act of indecency),
(e)   it is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.
(2)   A suppression order or non-publication order must specify the ground or grounds on which the order is made.""
39An important concept in s8 is the use of the word ""necessary"".  Fairfax Digital Australia provides useful guidance on that issue.
""8 In par [46] of his judgment, Basten JA has expressed the view that the meaning of ""necessary"" depends on the context in which it is used. I agree that what is necessary in any given case will depend on that context. It will depend on the particular grounds in s 8 of the Suppression Orders Act relied upon and the factual circumstances said to give rise to the order. I agree that the variables that Basten JA refers to in par [46] are all relevant to what will be necessary in a particular context. Although it is not sufficient, in my opinion, that the orders are merely reasonable or sensible, I agree that the word ""necessary"" should not be given a narrow construction. What was said by Hodgson JA in R v Kwok [2005] NSWCCA 245; (2005) 64 NSWLR 335 at [13] adopting the remarks of Mahoney JA in John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Receivers & Managers Appointed) v Local Court (NSW) (1991) 26 NSWLR 131 is equally applicable to the legislation in question.

""However, the requirement of necessity is not to be given an unduly narrow construction. I respectfully adopt what was said by Mahoney JA in John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Receivers & Managers Appointed v Local Court (NSW) (at 161B): 
""This leads to the consideration of what is meant by 'necessary to secure the proper administration of justice' in this context. The phrase does not mean that if the relevant order is not made, the proceedings will not be able to continue. Plainly they can. If the name of an informer is not hidden under a pseudonym, the proceeding will go on: at least, the instant proceeding will. And if the name of a security officer is revealed, the administration of justice or of the country will not collapse. The basis of the implication is that if the kind of order proposed is not made, the result will be - or at least will be assumed to be - that particular consequences will flow, that those consequences are unacceptable, and that therefore the power to make orders which will prevent them is to be implied as necessary to the proper function of the court. The kinds of consequences that, in this sense, will be seen as unacceptable may be gauged by those involved in the cases in which statutory courts have been accepted as having restrictive powers. Thus, there will be hardship on the informer or the security officer or the blackmail victim; the future supply of information from such persons will end or will be impeded; and it will be more difficult to obtain from such persons the evidence necessary to bring offenders before the courts and deal with them.  It is not necessary to attempt to state exhaustively the considerations relevant in this regard: it is to considerations of this kind or of an analogous kind on which the principle stated by McHugh JA is based.""
9 It follows that I agree with what Basten JA has said in par [48] of his judgment. I also agree that the requirement imposed by s 6 of the Suppression Orders Act, namely that in making an order the Court is required to take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is safeguarding the public interest in open justice, should not impede the Court from making an order when it is of the opinion that one of the grounds in s 8 is made out and that its importance will vary depending on the extent that any such order would interfere with that principle.""  (Bathurst CJ)
40Basten JA in the same case said:
""48 The broader concept of the administration of justice, including consequences not just for the present case but for future cases, including the supply of information from victims of unlawful conduct and the willingness of witnesses to give evidence, accords with the approach taken in this Court: ... Each of these cases was dealing with the implied power of courts, operating prior to the commencement of the Suppression Orders Act, and each involved orders which impinged on the operation of the open justice principle. Accepting that broad view, at least in some circumstances, the factors referred to in paragraphs (c) and (d) of s 8(1) may overlap with (a), because orders falling within those paragraphs might also be necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice.
49 This Court recently accepted that the ""principle of legality"" favours a construction of s 8 which has ""the least adverse impact upon the open justice principle and common law freedom of speech"": Rinehart v Welker [2011] NSWCA 403 at [26] (Bathurst CJ and McColl JA).  However, that approach may have a more limited application in circumstances where the proposed order does not impact upon the open justice principle because it does not prevent or restrict publication of court proceedings. The ""common law freedom of speech"" is not to be disregarded, but it provides a lesser obstacle to an order designed to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice.""
Ground 1
41It is clear from what occurred during the sentence proceedings on 10 May 2013 that there were extensive oral submissions from the applicant supplemented by written submissions.  Ample opportunity was provided for evidence to be produced and submissions in advance of 10 May 2013.  Extensive evidence had been given by the applicant in the sentence proceedings, hence his submission that the non-publication and suppression order should be continued.  The communication on behalf of the primary judge that the applicant's submissions were sufficient, did not equate with an acceptance that they were necessarily accepted.  It is clear from what occurred in open court, both during the course of the proceedings and on 10 May, that full submissions had already been advanced and that both sides had been provided with and had availed themselves of the opportunity to make submissions.  It is also not without significance that the applicant's solicitor was present on 10 May, even though the relevant submissions were made by the applicant himself.
42I am not satisfied that this ground of appeal has been made out.  Even if it had been made out, the applicant has now had ample opportunity to make further submissions and to provide further evidence in these proceedings.  He has availed himself of that opportunity.  SUPPRESSED 
Ground 2Ground 3
43Both these grounds can be dealt with together.  SUPRESSED 
44The Crown called evidence to the effect that while the applicant's initial offer to help the authorities in retrieving the rocket launchers might have been genuine, he simply did not follow through with it.  The Crown denied the contents of the agreement which the applicant said he had with the NSW Crime Commission.
45It is clear from both the content and tenor of the primary judge's findings on sentence that he accepted the Crown evidence and rejected that of the applicant in relation to the assistance which he said he actually provided with respect to the recovery of the rocket launchers.  His Honour noted that the extent of any assistance provided by the applicant was locating one firearm.  No-one had been identified or arrested in relation to that.  Neither the evidence in the sentence proceedings, nor that given before this Court was to the effect that there would be any reprisal visited upon the applicant or his family in respect of the locating of that single firearm.
46In relation to the alleged assistance in respect of retrieving the rocket launchers, it is apparent that the primary judge did not believe the applicant's evidence about an agreement with the NSW Crime Commission which allowed him to sell drugs.  By implication and expressly, his Honour did not accept that following the initial offer to assist (which the Crown conceded may have been genuine), the applicant did anything else which assisted in recovering the rocket launchers.
47In other words, on the evidence and findings of the primary judge, other than the location of one firearm, there was no action on the part of the applicant which would invite reprisals from the persons he described in the evidence before this Court.  No persons were identified and no arrests were made.
48It follows that the simple answer to Ground 2 and Ground 3 is that there were no actions on the part of the applicant which would have invited a reprisal from ""Jihadists"" and therefore it was not necessary to continue the non-publication and suppression orders.  They had initially been made because it was suspected that some evidence relating to the retrieval of the rocket launchers of a confidential nature might be given.  That did not occur.  Accordingly, the basis for the continuation of such orders under s8(1)(b) or 8(1)(e) no longer existed.
The protection of the applicant and his family
49In relation to s8(1)(c) the premise on which the handwritten submissions of the applicant were based, was found by his Honour not to exist, i.e., that the applicant had provided assistance to the authorities in the retrieval of the rocket launchers.  There was no conduct disclosed which would expose either him or his family to reprisals.
50It follows that there is nothing in either the primary judge's judgment on sentence, nor in the evidence before him which renders it necessary as that term is used in s8 of the Act for non-publication and suppression orders to be continued in respect of those matters.  Accordingly, the interim orders made by this Court on 14 May 2013 should be revoked.  SUPPRESSED 
Proceedings in this Court
51That does not end the matter. Evidence was given by the applicant in these proceedings which went beyond that which was before Zahra DCJ.  SUPPRESSED
52SUPPRESSED.
53It follows that I am satisfied that in relation to the applicant's evidence in these proceedings, a suppression and non-publication order is necessary to protect the safety of the applicant and his family.  It is also necessary, for the same reason (s8(1)(c) of the Act) that parts of this judgment be subject to a suppression and non-publication order.
Conclusion
54The orders which I propose are as follows:
(1) Leave to appeal is granted.
(2) The appeal is dismissed. 
(3) The interim suppression and non-publication orders made by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on 14 May 2013 in respect of the transcript and evidence in the sentence proceedings involving the applicant and sentence judgment of Zahra DCJ delivered on 10 May 2013 are revoked.
(4) Order suppression and non-publication in respect of the evidence given by the applicant in these proceedings on 11 June 2013.  Such order is made pursuant to s8(1)(c) of the Act and is to take effect throughout the Commonwealth of Australia until further order of the Court.
(5) Order suppression and non-publication with respect to parts of this judgment pursuant to s8(1)(c) of the Act.  Such order is to take effect throughout the Commonwealth of Australia until further order of the Court.
55HARRISON J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of the Chief Judge.  I agree with his Honour's proposed orders (4) and (5) for the making of suppression and non-publication orders in the terms suggested.  I disagree with his Honour's proposed orders (2) and (3) that the interim suppression and non-publication orders made by this Court on 14 May 2013 in respect of the transcript and evidence in the sentence proceedings involving the applicant and sentence judgment of Zahra DCJ delivered on 10 May 2013 should be revoked.  My reasons for this are as follows.
56The only basis upon which a suppression or non-publication order could be made in the present circumstances would be if s 8(1)(c) of the Act were triggered.  In my opinion there is sufficient material to support a finding that an order is necessary to protect the safety of the applicant.
57It will be apparent that the Chief Judge is of the view that neither the evidence in the sentence proceedings nor that given in this Court was to the effect that there would be any reprisals visited upon the applicant or his family in respect of the locating of the single firearm.  I respectfully agree with that observation.  SUPPRESSED
58In these circumstances the Chief Judge has indicated that in his opinion, based upon the evidence and findings of the primary judge, there was no action on the part of the applicant, including the location of one firearm, that would invite reprisals from the persons he described in the evidence in this Court.  His Honour has reasoned therefore that in the absence of actions or conduct on the part of the applicant disclosed in the proceedings before the primary judge that would expose either him or his family to reprisals from ""Jihadists"", there was nothing in either the primary judge's judgment on sentence or in the evidence before him that rendered it necessary (as that term is used in s 8 of the Act for non-publication and suppression orders) to be continued in respect of those matters.
59It is in my opinion a mistake to conflate either the truthfulness or usefulness of information and cooperation provided by the applicant to the authorities, with the likelihood that reprisals for having done so will follow if the fact of that provision of information or cooperation becomes publicly known.  Unless I misunderstand the applicant's position, his fear for his own safety is not the product of having successfully exposed potential offenders to detection or prosecution of conviction, so much as it is the product of the perception created that he has been prepared to assist in achieving one or some of those outcomes.  
60The term ""necessary"" is not to be given a restricted meaning.  It has to be interpreted and applied in context.  That context in my opinion includes the possibility of an irrational and illogical response by members of the applicant's faith, as so nominated by him in evidence in this Court, to the revelation of his historical dealings with the authorities concerning the rocket launchers, however unbelievable or unproductive they may have ultimately turned out to be in fact.  It is not in my view appropriate to balance or to calibrate the competing interests recognised by the Act, including relevantly for present purposes the applicant's safety, upon the fulcrum of an assumed reasoned and dispassionate response by the applicant's potential detractors to the material that he seeks to keep confidential.  If the potential publication of the applicant's evidence before the primary judge and in this Court raised even some doubt that his safety were compromised, he should in my opinion be given the benefit of that doubt when deciding the question of whether or not a suppression or non-publication order is necessary.  I consider that the material does raise that doubt.  The need to safeguard the public interest in open justice does not prevail in this case where in my opinion the s 8(1)(c) ground has been made out.
61In my opinion the following orders should be made:
(1)  Grant leave to appeal. 
(2)  Allow the appeal. 
(3)  Order that the interim suppression and non-publication orders made by this Court on 14 May 2013 in respect of the transcript and evidence in the sentence proceedings involving the applicant Zahra DCJ delivered on 10 May 2013 be continued.  Such order is made pursuant to s 8(1)(c) of the Act and is to take effect throughout the Commonwealth of Australia until further order of the Court. 
(4)  Set aside the so much of the interim suppression and non publication order made by this Court on 14 May 2013 as concerns the sentencing judgment of Zahra DCJ delivered on 10 May 2013 and in lieu thereof order that there be a suppression order in respect of those parts of that judgment that are listed in Schedule 1 hereto.  Such order is made pursuant to s 8(1)(c) of the Act and is to take effect throughout the Commonwealth of Australia until further order of the Court.
(5)  Order that there be suppression and non-publication in respect of the evidence given by the applicant in these proceedings on 11 June 2013.  Such order is made pursuant to s 8(1)(c) of the Act and is to take effect throughout the Commonwealth of Australia until further order of the Court. 
(6)  Order that there be suppression and non-publication in respect of those parts of this judgment listed in Schedule 2 hereto pursuant to s 8(1)(c) of the Act.  Such order is to take effect throughout the Commonwealth of Australia until further order of the Court.
(7)  Reserve liberty to apply to Harrison J in respect of the period up to and including 12 July 2013 and to Beech-Jones J thereafter in respect of any matter concerning the terms of these orders.

62BEECH-JONES J:  I have had the advantage of reading a draft of the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL.  His Honour's judgment relieves me of the necessity to set out the background to the appeal.
63As noted by His Honour once leave to appeal is granted under s 14 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (the ""Act"") then the appeal is by way of a fresh or ""de novo"" rehearing (Fairfax Digital Australia & New Zealand Pty Ltd v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125 at [6] per Bathurst CJ, at [23] per Basten JA and [106] per Whealy JA). However the grant of leave can be subject to conditions which can allow the Court to control its own procedures (Fairfax at [7] per Bathurst CJ, at [24] per Basten JA and at [106] per Whealy JA).  In this case the application for leave to appeal was heard on the basis that the argument and evidence in support of any appeal would be the same as that put forward in support of the application for leave to appeal.  Further, one of the grounds put forward is that the applicant was not given a proper opportunity to be heard before the interim suppression order made by Zahra DCJ was revoked.  Without deciding that ground, it appears to have some substance.  In view of that, and bearing in mind the nature of the interest that the applicant wishes to uphold, namely his personal safety and that of his family, I propose that leave to appeal be granted. 
64However, in my view one condition upon which leave should be granted is that any attempt to reagitate the findings of fact made by Zahra DCJ in sentencing the applicant should be refused. His Honour made those findings having received a significant body of evidence and detailed submissions. In the ordinary course the appropriate forum for any challenge to those findings is by way of an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In any event no challenge to any of his Honour findings in that judgment was made in this application.
65It is important to note the critical aspects of the sentencing judgment that relate to this application. SUPPRESSED
66SUPPRESSED 
67However, in this Court the applicant gave further evidence.  SUPPRESSED
68SUPPRESSED  
69Once this evidence is considered it is, to my mind, unrealistic to address the test posed by s 8(1)(c) on the basis that persons who might be minded to engage in reprisals will read Zahra DCJ's sentencing judgment and dismiss the applicant's conduct as not being a threat to them. SUPPRESSED
70As noted by Senior Counsel for the applicant, the test posed by s 8(1)(c) does not turn upon the genuineness of the proposed informer's motivations and whether their coming forward was ultimately of any assistance.  Instead the demonstration of whether it is necessary to protect a person is ascertained by an objective assessment of the level of risk posed.  In this case, the applicant's evidence has persuaded me that the test posed by ss 8(1)(c) has been made out.
71Consistent with the competing interests sought to be balanced by the Act, the full version of this judgment will not be publicly available.  However, a redacted version will be published. Of necessity the redacted version will not be able to fully explain the reasons for the making of the orders as to do so will jeopardise the very interest that is sought to be protected by the application.
72I agree with the orders proposed by Harrison J.  In particular it is not necessary for the protection of the applicant that the entirety of the sentencing judgment be suppressed.  A significant part of that judgment discusses the applicant's criminal conduct and other matters concerning his sentence which raise no issue concerning his safety.

2706488,R v CONNELL [2013] NSWCCA 155,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offences and sentenceThe respondent pleaded guilty to an indictment which contained 24 counts.  There were 13 counts of demand money with menaces with intent, contrary to s99(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years.   The first of those counts occurred on 13 May 2010 and the last on 7 September 2010.  There were also 11 counts of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime contrary to s193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years.  The first of those offences occurred on 20 May 2010 and the last on 7 September 2010.
2The respondent was sentenced by Charteris DCJ at the Sydney District Court on 17 December 2012.  His Honour imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months, commencing 1 February 2012 and expiring 31 August 2013.  The balance of term would expire on 30 April 2015.
3These proceedings are brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912.  Notice of the Appeal was signed on 7 March and served on the respondent on 9 March 2013.
Factual background
4The full factual background to this matter is set out in the matter of Delaney v R; R v Delaney [2013] NSWCCA 150.
5On 1 May 2010 the victim opened a tattoo parlour at Raymond Terrace.  On 3 May 2010 three members of the Rebels Motorcycle Club entered the tattoo parlour, threatened the victim and directed that he pay $200 per week or ""we can run you out of town if you don't pay"".  One of the persons who made this threat and demand was Darren Delaney and another was Julian Ivory.
6On 4 May 2010 the victim, as a result of various phone calls, met with Messrs Delaney and Ivory at a nearby fast food restaurant and handed over the initial amount of $200.
7The respondent's first appearance and participation in the joint criminal enterprise to extort protection money was on Thursday, 13 May 2010.  He went to the victim's shop and said ""I'm Joe.  I'm here to pick up the protection money"".  The money was in fact not paid to the respondent on this occasion because it had been previously collected by another member of the Rebels Motorcycle Club, Gregory Stolzenberg.
8The respondent subsequently attended the victim's shop on twelve occasions after 13 May 2010 until 7 September 2010 and received various amounts in cash from him.  As a result of complaints by the victim, the police made observations of the respondent's activities from 13 May 2010.
9When the victim complained of difficulties in maintaining payments, the amount required to be paid was slightly reduced and the payments were made monthly rather than weekly.  On at least one occasion, the respondent's attendance at the tattoo shop was electronically recorded by the police.
10On 7 September 2010 police officers stopped the vehicle in which the respondent and another male were travelling as passengers.  Both men were arrested and searched.  The police located cash in the amount of $1,817.30 of which $750 was cash supplied by the police to the victim earlier that day and handed by him to the respondent.
11The offences of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime related to the receipt of monies by the respondent as a result of the demands with menaces on 11 occasions.
Grounds of Appeal
12The Crown relied upon the following grounds of appeal.
Ground 1:  In imposing an aggregate sentence under s53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999, his Honour failed to assess the criminality of each individual offence or the way he came to the view as to the overall length of the sentence.
Ground 2:  His Honour erred in imposing identical penalties for the money-laundering offences and the offences of demand property with menaces in company.
Ground 3:  His Honour failed to have regard to the aggravating feature.
Ground 4:  His Honour did not have regard to ""matters of parity"".
Ground 5:  The failure to have regard to the respondent's role.
Ground 6:  His Honour erred in treating the respondent's bail conditions as a form of quasi-custody.
Ground 7:  His Honour erred in the extent to which a finding of special circumstances has altered the non-parole period.
Ground 8:  The failure to acknowledge the significance of general deterrence.
Ground 9:  The sentences are individually and as aggregated manifestly inadequate.
THE SENTENCE PROCEEDINGS
13His Honour noted that the respondent's pleas of guilty had not been entered at the earliest stage, but on the day the matters had been listed for trial.  Accordingly, his Honour allowed a discount of 10 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of those pleas of guilty.
14His Honour noted that it was an agreed fact that the respondent had joined in the criminal enterprise to extort monies on an ongoing basis from the victim after the initial threats had been made.  By doing so, he had adopted the threats made on 3 and/or 4 May 2010 by others.  It was common ground that the respondent did not personally utter threats or menaces to the victim.
15In relation to the objective seriousness of the offending, the primary judge referred to the surveillance footage and noted that the victim on occasions was very distressed, but that this did not prevent the respondent from taking money from him.  This was despite the fact that on one occasion, the victim advised the respondent that just days previously, the victim's son had hanged himself.  His Honour characterised the behaviour of the respondent generally as ""callous in the extreme"".
16The primary judge reviewed the respondent's subjective case.  At the time of sentence he was aged 50, having been born in 1962.  He had first come to the notice of the courts when aged 16, and thereafter had a long history of offences of dishonesty.  In 1982 he was fined for stealing and in 1989 he was convicted of goods in custody.  He had a number of convictions for drug offences.  In 1990 he was fined for assault and the following year was sentenced to community service for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  On two occasions in 2003 he was convicted of being in possession of a prohibited weapon.  Between 2008 and 2009 he had been convicted of common assault and various breaches of a domestic violence order.  Eventually he was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment in respect of one of those matters, which was suspended.  The suspended sentence was imposed on 7 September 2009 which meant that the respondent was subject to that suspended sentence when the first six counts on the indictment occurred.
17The primary judge had before him a psychological report.  The respondent was the youngest of four boys and there was a large age difference between his older brothers and himself.  His father abused alcohol and was violent towards his mother.  The respondent had run away from home when he was 13 as a result of the conduct of his father.  At the age of 14 the respondent went to live with one of his older brothers.  When he turned 21, the relationship with his father improved because he could ""fully hit back"".  When the respondent was able to defend himself, his father ceased directing physical violence towards him.
18The respondent was not a good student.  He repeated years at school and truanted on a number of occasions.  He left school effectively in year 7.  The respondent is unable to read or write.
19The respondent worked as a labourer in Stockton near Newcastle until he was 21.  Thereafter his employment was intermittent at best and he spent many years in receipt of unemployment benefits.  When he was 38 he worked for 5 years in a screen-printing and graphic design business with a friend, but the business was never really successful and it failed in 2004.  Apart from some gardening and lawn mowing, the respondent has done little work since then.
20The respondent has had a number of relationships.  He has a son aged 29 of one relationship.  The respondent acknowledged to the psychologist that he had been violent towards his girlfriend in that relationship when he was drug affected.  At age 29 he entered another relationship which lasted 15 years.  There were three children of that relationship; a daughter 19 and two sons aged 18 and 6.  The respondent used cannabis throughout that relationship, but did not engage in domestic violence against that partner.  He did assault his partner's brother which resulted in the AVO to which reference has already been made.  That relationship finally ceased approximately 6 years before the respondent came to be sentenced.
21The respondent has been in his present relationship for about 4 years.  His partner is only 24 years of age, has a daughter from a prior relationship and a son and daughter to the respondent aged respectively 2 years and 13 months.  All of those children, including the step-daughter were in foster care at the time of sentence.
22The respondent acknowledged to the psychologist that he had formed negative peer associations from an early age and was introduced to drug abuse and crime by older persons.  He became a member of the Rebels Motorcycle Club approximately 5 years before because he experienced a ""sense of belonging"" to that Club.  Since his arrest, he had severed all ties with the club.
23The respondent acknowledged that he had substantially abused alcohol during the first relationship, but had been substantially abstinent during the second, although he had used cannabis more heavily.  He had been using cannabis since he was a teenager.  He said that he used cannabis to ""relax"".
24The psychologist concluded that violence was normal in the respondent's family in his early years and that as a result, he had begun exhibiting problems with anger and impulse control from a young age.  She concluded that he had limited life management skills and an unsophisticated psychological insight, together with low self esteem, anger management and impulsivity problems.  She recommended counselling, directed to his abuse of cannabis and his tendency to associate with peers who led him into trouble.  She recommended drug and alcohol counselling and anger management counselling.
25His Honour had before him a victim impact statement in which the victim described how his business had been ""wrecked"" by the conduct of the respondent and other Rebels Motorcycle Club members.  The victim had become emotionally and mentally unstable, making it difficult for him to obtain employment.  While his Honour took into account the undoubted adverse effect of the respondent's conduct on the victim, he also noted that there were a number of other factors which had led to disruption of the victim's life, in particular the suicide of his son.
26The primary judge characterised the respondent's behaviour as serious and said that it was made worse because the criminal activity occurred over 4 months and involved 13 visits to the tattoo shop to extort money.  Although the amount involved was less than $3000, his Honour accepted that the sentence to be imposed must reflect the community's abhorrence of such behaviour.  Even though he didn't make the initial threats, the applicant had taken advantage of them.
27The respondent did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings.  His Honour was not prepared to accept that he was merely a ""foot soldier"" in the activities of the Rebels Motorcycle Club, but did accept that he was in a lesser position to Mr Ivory, who seemed to be in charge of the payment procedure.
28The primary judge took into account that the money taken from the victim was not only for the respondent's benefit, but was to be shared amongst other members of the Rebels Motorcycle Club.  His Honour noted that the respondent had spent approximately 9 months and 17 days in custody and had been subject to rigorous bail conditions for 18 months while he was out of custody.  Because of his bail conditions, and the fact that he had been required to report to police in excess of 500 occasions, his Honour backdated the commencement date for his sentence by one month.
29In relation to aggravating factors, his Honour accepted that the offences were part of an organised criminal activity.  He was not prepared to take into account the element of financial gain, since this formed part of the offences.  His Honour said that while he took into account the injury and harm to the victim, he did not regard it by itself as an aggravating matter.  His Honour also had regard to the maximum penalties prescribed for these offences.
30His Honour thought that other than the plea of guilty there were no mitigating factors.  His Honour accepted that he should make a finding of special circumstances because of the need for the respondent to have a longer period of supervision to try to achieve rehabilitation.
31Rather than impose 24 separate sentences, his Honour sought to utilise s53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and to impose an aggregate sentence.  Had he not utilised that provision, his Honour indicated that he would have imposed sentences of 1 year and 9 months for each offence, with a non-parole period of 12 months.
32Although the Crown has relied upon 9 separate grounds of appeal, they all relate to the question of manifest inadequacy and are said cumulatively to establish that result.  Accordingly, each ground of appeal can be briefly dealt with. 
Ground 1:  In imposing an aggregate sentence under s53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999, his Honour failed to assess the criminality of each individual offence or the way he came to the view as to the overall length of the sentence.
33The Crown submitted that the indicative sentences identified by his Honour for each offence did not adequately take into account that the respondent was serving a suspended sentence when the first six offences occurred and made no distinction between the two different types of charges.  In that regard, the Crown relied upon the observations of RA Hulme J in R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 where his Honour said:
""56 McClellan CJ at CL has referred (at [31] - [32]) to the provisions of s 53A, including the requirement in s 53A(2)(b) that a court must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. In an apparent attempt to give effect to this requirement, the sentencing judge in this case said:

""I am imposing an aggregate sentence. In my opinion each of these four offences is of similar seriousness and each would warrant, taking into account the discount for early plea, a sentence of four years imprisonment. There would have to be a degree of accumulation.""
57 With respect to the judge, this would appear to be doing little more than paying lip service to the requirement in s 53A(2)(b). I do not understand how the same sentence for each offence can be justified. True it is that they were offences of a similar (but not identical) nature and that the maximum penalty for each was the same.  However, the judge was asked to take into account further offences when he sentenced for two of the offences; a reason in itself for the individual sentences to vary. The judge appears to have taken a similar approach to that taken by the sentencing judge in R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199, described there (at [26]) as applying a ""blanket assessment"".
58 The importance of proper compliance with the requirement to indicate the separate sentences that would have been imposed arises for at least four reasons.  First, it assists a sentencing judge in application of the totality principle, an important factor in the assessment of the aggregate sentence to be imposed.  Secondly, it exposes for appellate review how it is that the aggregate sentence was arrived at: see R v Brown at [17] per Grove AJ.  Thirdly, it allows victims of crime and the public at large to understand the level of seriousness with which a court has regarded an individual offence.  Fourthly, it assists this Court to assess an appropriate new aggregate sentence if one or some of the underlying convictions are quashed on appeal.""
34The facts in this case and those in Nykolyn are quite different.  In this case the offences contrary to s99(2) Crimes Act 1900 were identical and there was no logical basis to differentiate one from the other.  Because the offences were part of a continuing course of conduct, there was a need for accumulation which did occur as the aggregate sentence makes clear.
35As more fully discussed in Delaney at [37] and [66] it would have been wrong for the primary judge to have increased the aggregate sentence by having regard to the 11 ""deal with the proceeds of crime"" charges.  This was because of the significant overlap between the s99(2) and s193B(2) offences.
36As was said in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 by the plurality (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ):
""40 To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means that offences overlap.  To punish an offender twice if conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts.""
37The relationship and overlap between the two sets of offences in this matter was such that there was no error on the part of his Honour in imposing the same sentence for each of the s193(2) offences as for the s99(2) offences and making them wholly concurrent.  If anything, the fact that the sentences for the offences contrary to s193B(2) were wholly concurrent with those for the s99(2) offences was adverse to the respondent in that Pearce made it clear that in such cases where there was a significant overlap, the sentences imposed for related matters should be less rather than the same.
38This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2:  His Honour erred in imposing identical penalties for the money-laundering offences and the offences of demand property with menaces in company.
39This ground has already been dealt with in the discussion in relation to ground 1.  To the extent that there was an error, it favoured the Crown and was adverse to the respondent.  This the Crown fairly conceded.
40As the Crown appreciated, not only was this issue analysed in Pearce but more recently in analogous circumstances, the situation was discussed by Adams J in Brent Redfern v R [2012] NSWCCA 178 where his Honour said:
""17 It is self evident, as it seems to me, that the totality of the applicant's criminality in the charged offences is not increased by the fact that he had in his possession the money paid to him for the supply of the drugs.  It would be as sensible to have charged and punished him additionally with possession of the drugs for the purpose of supplying the undercover police officer because he had the drugs in his possession.  Both the possession of the drug itself and the proceeds of sale are part and parcel of the primary offence. It needs hardly to be said that it is immaterial that he had the cash in his possession at the point of sale as distinct from in the safe in his home. To punish him additionally for either one of those aspects of his conduct is to double count ...""
41To the extent that any error occurred it favoured the Crown.
Ground 3:  His Honour failed to have regard to the aggravating feature.
42The Crown submitted that although his Honour had correctly found that the fact that the offences were part of an organised criminal activity was a matter of aggravation, he did not reflect that finding in the sentence which was imposed.
43His Honour referred to this aggravating feature.  There is nothing in his Honour's analysis of the various competing considerations in this matter to indicate that his Honour did not take that factor into account as part of the process of intuitive synthesis which resulted in the sentence.
44This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 4:  His Honour did not have regard to ""matters of parity"".
45This matter was also dealt with in Delaney at [68] - [70].
46As there stated, the parity principle is one of amelioration designed to benefit offenders.  It was not developed as a means by which the Crown could have sentences increased.
47This ground has not been made out.
Ground 5:  The failure to have regard to the respondent's role.
48The Crown submitted that his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending and the part played by the respondent in it was not reflected in the aggregate sentence imposed.  The Crown emphasised the primary judge's observation that not only was each offence serious, but when viewed as a continuing course of conduct, the severity of the criminal behaviour was increased.  The Crown submitted that this finding was not reflected by the aggregate sentence.
49As with ground 3, his Honour took this matter into account and discussed it in some detail in his sentence judgment.  There is nothing to suggest that he did not have it in mind when imposing the aggregate sentence.  
50This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 6:  His Honour erred in treating the respondent's bail conditions as a form of quasi-custody.
51The Crown submitted that it was not open to his Honour to backdate the commencement of the aggregate sentence by one month because of the bail conditions fulfilled by the respondent over 18 months.  This was because the respondent had not been in a residential facility and because his Honour did not find that the bail conditions were onerous.  
52The choice of a commencement date for a sentence is a discretionary matter.  In this case, his Honour indicated the basis for his exercise of discretion.  He referred to the restriction on the respondent's liberty over the 18 months that he was on bail and to the fact that he was required to report to police ""in excess of five hundred occasions"".  His Honour adjusted the commencement date for the sentence by one month to take these matters into account.  I am not persuaded that his Honour's discretion miscarried by doing so.  
53This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 7:  His Honour erred in the extent to which a finding of special circumstances has altered the non-parole period.
54The Crown submitted that the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence was 60 percent, which in the circumstances of this offending was manifestly inadequate.
55The Crown accepted in the sentencing proceedings that a finding of special circumstances was open to his Honour.  Accordingly, the only issue which appears to be raised by this ground is the extent of the adjustment made by the primary judge.  This has always been a matter of discretion in respect of which this Court has been slow to intervene (Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277).  Given the nature of the rehabilitation identified by the psychologist, I am not persuaded that his Honour's exercise of discretion on this issue miscarried.
56This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 8:  The failure to acknowledge the significance of general deterrence.
57The Crown submitted that although his Honour referred to the seriousness of the offending, he did not in terms acknowledge the significance of general deterrence.  The Crown submitted that in offences of this kind, general deterrence is an important principle because of the need:
To protect certain members of the community.
To discourage this kind of offending.
58It is true that the primary judge did not use the words ""general deterrence"".  What his Honour did say (ROS 14.1) was:
""The sentence I impose must reflect the community's abhorrence of behaviour such as this.""
This, it seems to me, is an acknowledgement of the importance of general deterrence, particularly having regard to the context in which the observation was made.  The focus of his Honour's remarks in this part of the sentence judgment was on the protection of persons conducting a business and the deterring of offending conduct of this kind.
59This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 9:  The sentences are individually and as aggregated manifestly inadequate.
60The appellant submitted that for the reasons set out in the other grounds of appeal and because the s99(2) offences were serious examples of this type of offence, were part of an organised criminal activity and would have continued indefinitely if it had not been for police intervention, the aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
61As the Crown acknowledged, in order to make good this ground, it was necessary to establish that the aggregate sentence was inadequate in the well recognised sense that it was unreasonable or plainly unjust:  (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370 - 371).  It is also the case that absent error, this Court may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion differently (Lowndes v R [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671 - 72).  Intervention is warranted only where error is established in accordance with the principles in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505.
62I am not persuaded that the obligation undertaken by the Crown in making out this ground of appeal has been discharged.  While the aggregate sentence may be regarded by some as somewhat lenient, it is certainly within the appropriate range for offences of this kind.  The respondent did not initiate the extortion but only ""later became a party"".  While each attendance involved a separate act of criminality, the overlap between all of the offences was considerable.  At no stage did the respondent utter threats or menaces.  Those matters together with the respondent's unfortunate upbringing confirm my conclusion that the sentence imposed by the primary judge is not manifestly inadequate.
63This ground of appeal has not been made out.
64The orders which I propose are as follows:
(1) The Crown appeal is dismissed.
65HARRISON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
66BEECH-JONES J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL and the orders his Honour proposes.

2706489,"CRAIGIE (aka CREIGHTON), Derek James v R [2013] NSWCCA 153","Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J.

2HIDDEN J: The appellant, Derek James Craigie, was found guilty at trial in the District Court of four counts of sexual assault, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. He appeals against conviction only.

3Given the nature of the grounds of appeal, it is unnecessary to recite the facts. It is sufficient to say that the complainant of the offences was the appellant's cousin. His name is not Craigie. He was aged between 15 and 16 years at the time. The offences occurred in 1998 and 1999. The appellant and the complainant were members of a large extended Aboriginal family, which at the relevant time was living in the Newcastle area, having moved there from Moree. Another cousin of the appellant, Owen Craigie, was playing football for the Newcastle Knights team. The family home was at North Lambton, but Owen Craigie was living in a unit at Adamstown. Sometimes the appellant stayed with a family friend, Eddie Strachan, who lived in a townhouse also at Adamstown. 

4The complainant's evidence was that the first offence occurred at Mr Strachan's home in about May 1998. Other family members were at the home on the occasion but at the time the offence occurred they had left to buy some alcohol. 

5The second and third offences occurred on another occasion, sometime in the winter of 1998, at Owen Craigie's unit, where the complainant was staying overnight. Again, various members of the family, together with Eddie Strachan and two other men, Sean Swan and Nigel Welsh, had been at the unit, but had left with Owen Craigie to go out for drinks. The offences occurred in their absence, and after them the complainant locked himself in Owen Craigie's room. It was sometime later that Owen Craigie returned to the unit. 

6The fourth offence occurred in February 1999 at the family home at North Lambton. Yet again, other members of the family were at the home. The complainant excused himself from the gathering and went to sleep in a granny flat in the backyard. He was woken by the appellant, and it was there that the offence was committed.

7The complainant told no-one about any of this until 2007, and in November of that year he made a statement to the police. The appellant was not arrested until 1 July 2010, and the trial took place between late February and early March 2012.

8There are two grounds of appeal:

(1) The unsatisfactory police investigation and the continuous service of critical fresh evidence, after the trial had commenced, has resulted in a substantial miscarriage of justice.

(2) The trial miscarried by reason of the misconduct of a juror, locating a relevant witness during the trial.

Neither the prosecutor (a trial advocate) nor defence counsel at the trial appeared in this court.

1. Investigation and conduct of the trial

9Counsel for the appellant, Ms Carroll, pointed out that almost 3 years elapsed between the complaint to police and the arrest of the appellant, a delay which she said was not adequately explained. The officer in charge of the investigation, Sergeant Magann, gave evidence of problems in the course of the investigation, including difficulties in contacting some potential Crown witnesses and the refusal of others to assist police. In the result, statements had not been obtained from Eddie Strachan, Sean Swan, Nigel Welsh and six members of the extended family, including Owen Craigie. 

10It is not for this court to assess the efficiency and adequacy of a police investigation, except in so far as it might bear upon whether a miscarriage of justice occurred. It is not apparent that the delay, of itself, caused a miscarriage of justice in the present case. Nor, in the event, did Ms Carroll articulate one. As was pointed out by the Crown Advocate, Ms Adams SC, who appeared with Ms Davidson for the Crown, substantial delay between the events complained of and the trial is common enough in cases of this kind. The trial judge gave a thorough direction to the jury about the forensic disadvantage to the appellant from the delay, in accordance with Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79. No complaint was, or could have been, made about that direction. 

11However, the matter does not end there. There appears to have been a flurry of investigative activity at or about the time of the trial, leading to the service on the appellant's legal representatives of new material in the course of the trial. 

12A number of additional statements, including two statements by the complainant, were served on the defence shortly before the trial commenced and while it was running. Defence counsel appeared to be able to cope with this, assisted on one occasion by an examination of the complainant in a Basha enquiry. At no stage did he seek the discharge of the jury. It is unnecessary to go to the detail of these statements. It is sufficient to refer to the issues to which they relate.

13The first of those was evidence of complaint. Prior to the trial the only evidence on that question was that the complainant had told his sister what had happened to him. This was in the context of the sister's allegation that the appellant had sexually assaulted her and another sister. However, in an additional statement made on the first day of the trial the complainant said that he had complained to his uncle towards the end of July 2007. This followed a suicide attempt by him (a matter which he had revealed in his initial statement to the police, without reference to any complaint to his uncle). The uncle had since died. In this additional statement he also said that he complained to his father in early August 2007. This was the subject of the Basha enquiry. 

14The trial judge rejected evidence of the complaint to the sister and of the suicide. (I should add that the appellant was later acquitted in the Local Court of the charges relating to his sisters.) However, on the second day of the trial the complainant did give evidence before the jury of the complaint to his uncle and to his father. 

15The father had made a statement to the police before the trial, in which he said nothing about the complainant having made any complaint to him. However, on the third day of the trial the father made an additional statement in which he did recount such a complaint. In that statement the father said that around the middle of 2007 he was told by the uncle about the complainant's attempt at suicide. Some time later his daughter told him that the appellant had molested her and her sister, and also the complainant. Some time later again, he and Owen Craigie took the complainant for a drive to a lookout, where he confronted the complainant about the matter and demanded to be told the truth. The complainant then said that the appellant had raped him. He explained that he had been reluctant to tell his father about it because the appellant was the father's favourite nephew and he did not think that anyone would believe him. His father offered him his full support, and it was shortly thereafter that the matter was brought to the attention of police.

16The complainant's evidence of his complaint to his father was to much the same effect but, as I have said, he placed it in early August 2007 and, according to him, it was made in the course of a telephone conversation with his father.

17On the fourth day of the trial, when the complainant had completed his evidence in chief but was yet to be cross-examined, the trial advocate and defence counsel agreed that the father would not be called to give evidence but the jury would be presented with a document setting out agreed facts, pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995, concerning his two statements. That document was admitted later that day. It said:

""1 The complainant's father ... made two statements to the police in relation to this matter on 21 December 2007 and 29 February 2012. 

2 In neither of those statements did [the father] say that he had ever spoken to his son ... on the telephone in around August 2007. 

3 In neither of those statements did [the father] say his son ... had ever told him in around August 2007 that he had been 'raped by [the appellant]'.""

18In the event, then, the evidence of complaint to the appellant's sister was rejected. The evidence of complaint to the uncle was admitted, stripped of its context following a suicide attempt. As to that evidence, his Honour cautioned the jury that it may be unreliable because the uncle was not available to give evidence. The complainant's evidence of complaint to his father was admitted, but the jury were told that his father's statements did not support that evidence. While it is true that this evidence had to be dealt with in the first days of the trial, it emerged more favourably to the appellant than it might have done. It does not appear to me that this course of events gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.

19One further matter should be mentioned. Also on the fourth day of the trial, the complainant made yet another statement. In that statement he did describe the complaint to his father having occurred at the lookout. He said that both his father and Owen asked if he was ""gay"" or ""straight"", adding that it would be ""perfectly alright"" if he was gay. He said that he was straight. In written submissions Ms Carroll also complained that this evidence was not led, arguing that the suggestion that he was gay might have given the complainant a motive to fabricate his evidence against the appellant. 

20This submission appears to have been founded upon the mistaken belief that the conversation about whether the appellant was gay emerged from the father's statement. It did not; it appeared only in the additional statement of the complainant. It was material available to defence counsel, about which he could have cross-examined the complainant if he wished. Whether cross-examination about that matter might have been a sound tactical decision is debateable. Counsel's choice not to do so could hardly be criticised.

21The other matter about which additional evidence was served after the trial commenced related to the complainant's schooling in 1998 and 1999, the years during which the offences were said to have been committed. The material disclosed his enrolment at the school in 1998 and term dates and school vacations in 1998 and 1999. This material was used to help establish the dates of the offences, a matter of significance because the first three counts alleged sexual assault in a circumstance of aggravation, being that the complainant was under 16 years of age at the time. 

22Again, defence counsel dealt with this material and did not seek a discharge of the jury because of it. The primary argument which Ms Carroll mounted in written submissions relating to this evidence was not pressed at the hearing of the appeal. 

23Certainly, the amount of evidence that was served upon the defence at the eleventh hour was unusual, causing his Honour at one stage to criticise the adequacy of the investigation. In written submissions Ms Carroll argued that a miscarriage of justice arose ""out of defence counsel's inability to adequately reflect upon and properly consider the new evidence and its implications to the nature of the case as it was unfolding - let alone any chance to further investigate or question"" the material served. However, defence counsel apparently did not see it that way and, apart from that broad assertion, Ms Carroll was unable to articulate any specific basis upon which a miscarriage might be found.

24Finally, as to the potential witnesses who were not called, Ms Carroll noted the length of time between the trial and the events alleged and the need for as much evidence as possible of the surrounding circumstances. In addition, the appellant had suffered a significant brain injury in a car accident in 2001, and had no memory of the relevant events in 1998 and 1999. He did not give evidence at the trial. 

25However, apart from the complainant's father, it is not known what any of those witnesses might have said. In the event, the only witnesses in the Crown case were the complainant and Sergeant Magann. Yet again, this was not the subject of complaint by trial counsel and one could imagine that he might have been content that the trial was conducted in that way. The complainant's evidence stood alone and, as the Chief Judge suggested in argument, defence counsel may have taken the view that ""less is more."" His Honour gave the jury directions about the absence of these potential witnesses, and about the appellant's memory difficulties, which were favourable to the appellant. 

26Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the matters raised under this ground, individually or collectively, establish a miscarriage of justice. This ground is not made out.

2. The juror

27It was on the fourth day of the trial that Sergeant Magann gave evidence. In the course of explaining his difficulties in obtaining statements from potential witnesses, he said that he had been informed that Owen Craigie was in China on business. As the jury were leaving the court at the end of that day's hearing, a juror had a conversation with one of the sheriff's officers about the whereabouts of Owen Craigie. The officer reported what occurred in a note to the trial judge, as follows:

""A male juror said that I know the location of Owen Craigie. He is at Wallsend Oval now playing football.""

The note went on to record that the officer told the juror that he should not discuss any aspect of the trial with sheriff's officers.

28His Honour discussed the matter with the trial advocate and defence counsel the following morning. The sheriff's officer told the court that other jurors were in the immediate vicinity when the juror spoke to him. By agreement, his Honour gave a direction to the jury to the effect that the only evidence before them was that Owen Craigie was in China, and that the statement by the juror to the contrary should be ignored. He emphasised that the case was to be decided on the evidence heard in court, the addresses of counsel and his directions of law.

29Ms Carroll submitted that these directions were insufficient to guard against a miscarriage of justice. She argued that his Honour should have enquired how the juror knew of the location of Owen Craigie, adding that this court could not be satisfied that the juror had not made enquiries of his own and may even have himself spoken to Owen Craigie about the matter. This, she said, would have amounted to juror misconduct akin to that identified in R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37, 60 NSWLR 86. 

30In Skaf two jurors had privately inspected the area where the offences were said to have occurred, there being an issue whether the complainant could have identified the accused in the lighting available at the scene. The appellant had been convicted, but the Court of Criminal Appeal ordered a new trial because it could not be satisfied that there had not been a material irregularity affecting the verdict. However, the court accepted a Crown submission that ""the simple fact that the jurors went to the park for a private view, whilst clearly wrongful, did not of itself amount to a material irregularity."" Their Honours added that the ""issue of materiality depends of what was actually seen and done at the park"": [267] (p 102). Clearly, the present case is very different from Skaf.

31This trial was held at Newcastle. It is highly likely that members of the jury knew of Owen Craigie because he played for the Newcastle Knights. At the outset of the trial, in the course of addressing the jury panel in accordance with s 38(7)(a) of the Jury Act 1977, the trial advocate said that Mr Craigie might be mentioned in the evidence, and that he was ""a professional footballer that played for the Newcastle Knights around the time that the facts are concerned with in this case ... ."" After the jury was empanelled, in the course of conventional opening directions, his Honour told the jury that they must not make any enquiries outside the courtroom about any matter relating to any of the issues in the trial, and that they should not discuss the case with anybody except their fellow jurors and only when they were all together in the jury room. 

32His Honour was not asked to examine the juror to determine the source of his knowledge of Owen Craigie's whereabouts. In discussion with counsel, he observed that it was probably information the juror had ""anyway."" Defence counsel responded that that was perhaps the case but that, in any event, he did not want to ""set off a chain of enquiry by that particular juror or anything ... ."" 

33The appellant's legal representatives in the appeal did not seek to set in train an investigation into the matter by the sheriff under s 73A of the Jury Act. However, at the hearing Ms Carroll submitted that that was an option this court could consider. Upon reflection, I do not believe that an investigation is necessary.

34It might have been preferable for his Honour to have examined the juror. Nevertheless, the likely explanation for the juror's observation is that he was aware that Owen Craigie was playing football at that particular oval because of Mr Craigie's prominence as a footballer in the area. Certainly, in the time between Sergeant Magann's evidence that he believed Mr Craigie to be in China and the juror's disclosure to the sheriff's officer, the juror would have had no opportunity to make his own enquiries about Mr Craigie's whereabouts. 

35If the juror had personal contact with Mr Craigie before the trial, one would have expected him to come forward when the prosecutor addressed the panel under s 37(7)(a); and if he had had any discussion with Mr Craigie about the trial while it was in progress, he would have been in breach of his Honour's clear directions after the jury was empanelled. The possibility that there was an irregularity through the juror's contact with Mr Craigie is no more than speculative. Here again, I am not persuaded that this incident gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. This ground also is not made out. 

36I would dismiss the appeal.

37FULLERTON J: I agree with Hidden J.

2706490,McLaughlin v R [2013] NSWCCA 152,"Judgment

1LATHAM J: I agree with Button J.

2BUTTON J: On 5 April 2012 in the District Court of New South Wales at Penrith, her Honour Judge Syme sentenced Francis Downie McLaughlin (""the applicant"") for three offences. They were: an assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed on 2 March 2010; a further assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed on 18 August 2010; and a common assault committed on 26 September 2010. The maximum penalty for the first two offences was imprisonment for 5 years and the maximum penalty for the common assault was imprisonment for 2 years. None of the offences attracted a standard non-parole period. All of the offences could have been dealt with in the Local Court.

3Her Honour imposed the following sentences of imprisonment. With regard to count 1, the first assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a fixed term of imprisonment for 15 months was imposed, to date from 5 April 2012. With regard to count 2, the second assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 12 months was imposed, to date from 5 August 2012. With regard to count 3, the common assault, a fixed term of imprisonment for 1 year was imposed, to date from 5 June 2012. 

4Accordingly, a total head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years 4 months with a total non-parole period of 1 year 4 months was imposed. A diagram annexed to this judgment sets out the sentence structure in a readily comprehensible form.

5Special circumstances were found that permitted a variation of the ratio between the total non-parole period and the total head sentence; if that had not been the case, the total non-parole period would have been 1 year 9 months.

6The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences.

Objective features

7These were established by agreed facts. 

8In 2010, the applicant was living in Blaxland with his then de facto partner (""the victim""). She had met the applicant when his musical band was touring in Tasmania in 2008. The victim and her young son (whose age was not detailed in the proceedings on sentence, but who was clearly a child) had moved from that State to live with the applicant in the Blue Mountains in 2009. The victim was vulnerable and isolated, in that she was unemployed, cut off from friends and family in Tasmania, and suffers from a physical disability to her leg.

9With regard to count 1, on about 3 March 2010, the applicant and the victim were at home. An argument developed. The victim absented herself from the room, and went to her bedroom and lay on the bed. The applicant entered that bedroom and dragged her off the bed by her feet, causing her to fall from the bed. As she did so, her jaw hit the edge of the bed, forcing her to bite into her lip. Her lip bled and her jaw was bruised.

10With regard to count 2, on 18 August 2010 the victim and the applicant were at home arguing. The applicant hit the victim to the side of the head near her eye, causing an injury there. The offence also indirectly caused bruising to her elbow and knee.

11With regard to count 3, on the evening of 26 September 2010 the applicant and the victim commenced to argue at home about an apprehended violence order (""AVO"") that was in force to protect the victim from the applicant (a topic to which I shall return). The young son of the victim was sleeping in the bedroom. The victim walked away from the argument and entered that bedroom. The applicant grabbed the victim by the hair and dragged her back. He then grabbed her by the throat, and as a result she fell to the floor.

12In a victim impact statement that was delivered orally in court, the victim detailed the psychological effects that the offences of the applicant had had upon her. She explained that she had ""not slept properly"" for quite some time. She also had suffered from ""severe panic attacks"". She was unable to tolerate being touched for at least 18 months after the commission of the offences, and she continued to have issues in that regard as at the date of sentence.

Subjective features

13The applicant pleaded guilty on the morning of the trial, and received a 10 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of his pleas as a result. Neither party to the appeal impugns that discount.

14Aged 41 as at the date of sentence, the applicant was born in Scotland and came to Australia as a toddler. He had enjoyed a stable and happy upbringing. He left school in Year 11, and had been employed in most of the years since then. At the time of the offences he was the lead singer of a popular musical band that seemed destined for greater success. He had spent some time employed in logistics, and was very highly regarded as a worker.

15The applicant gave evidence that he accepted that he had suffered from a serious problem with alcohol and control of his anger. Prior to the date of sentence he had sought counselling, and had found that to be very beneficial.

16His criminal record was short but significant. In 1991 he was fined for offensive conduct. In 1992 he was placed on a bond for 12 months for the offence of common assault. In 2000 he was fined and placed on an apprehended violence order (""AVO"") for common assault. The facts of the matter were placed before her Honour. Briefly, the applicant had struck a woman with whom he was then in a relationship to the head whilst verbally abusing her in the home that they shared. That victim was not the victim in the matter under appeal. All of this was observed by police who had attended the premises. The applicant admitted the offence to the police.

17On 17 April 2010 (that is, about six weeks after the commission of count 1, and before the commission of count 2), the applicant assaulted the victim in the matter under appeal, and inflicted actual bodily harm. For some reason the facts of that matter were not before her Honour, and are therefore not known to this Court. The matter was dealt with on 22 June 2010 (again, before the commission of count 2), when the applicant pleaded guilty and received a 12 month bond with supervision. He was also placed on an AVO with regard to the victim.

18It follows that counts 2 and 3 were offences of violence committed in breach of a bond and an AVO imposed as a result of an offence of violence against the same victim only months beforehand.

Grounds of appeal

19Four grounds of appeal were originally notified, but two were maintained at the hearing:

1. Her Honour erred when she found that the offences were aggravated by the fact that they took place in 'the generalised presence of a child under the age of 18 years.'

3. The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.

20I shall deal with them in that order.

Ground one
""Her Honour erred when she found that the offences were aggravated by the fact that they took place in 'the generalised presence of a child under the age of 18 years.'""

Background and submissions

21In the remarks on sentence, her Honour said:

""Another potential aggravating circumstance to take into account is whether the offence was committed in the presence of a child under the age of eighteen years. There is no evidence before me that the child who was a family member actually saw the offences as they were committed, however, the effect of domestic violence situations on children whether they actually witness the violence or not is well documented. It creates secondary damage in children which can frequently disrupt their development. Therefore, in my view the generalised presence of a child of under the age of eighteen years is an aggravating circumstance in these matters, notwithstanding the fact that I acknowledge the child did not physically see the offence being committed. Therefore it is an aggravating circumstance but perhaps of lesser importance than it might have been if the child had witnessed the offence. Nevertheless it is worth stating.""

22Counsel for the applicant submitted that it was an error for her Honour to take into account, as an aggravating feature pursuant to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the commission of the offence in the presence of a child. She submitted that, with regard to the first two counts, there was no evidence that the son of the victim was present. Although with regard to the third count there was evidence that the child was in the bed in the bedroom, there was no evidence as to whether he was awake or not during or after the commission of the offence. If the child had been awake, it was accepted that count 3 would have been committed in his presence. 

23Reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in Gore v R; Hunter v R [2010] NSWCCA 330; (2010) 208 A Crim R 353 and of Price J in R v Seymour [2012] NSWSC 1010. In short, it was submitted that the sentencing Judge had found an aggravating feature established that, in truth, could not be made out on the evidence.

24The Crown submitted that the language used by her Honour was equivocal. Senior counsel submitted that it was by no means clear that the presence of a child had been taken into account as an aggravating feature with regard to any offence. The ancillary position of the Crown was that, if error were established, there would be no reduction in any sentence as a result of consideration of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

Determination

25Section 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is as follows:

""(2) Aggravating factors

The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows:

...

(ea) the offence was committed in the presence of a child under 18 years of age,

...""

26It is true that the remarks of her Honour with regard to this aspect do not make it absolutely clear whether the presence of the child was relied upon by her Honour as an aggravating feature.

27However, reading the remarks on sentence as a whole, I consider that it is reasonably well established that her Honour took into account as an aggravating feature the ""generalised presence"" of the child.

28In Gore v R; Hunter v R at [104], this Court called for a strict approach to proof of this aggravating feature pursuant to s 21A(2)(ea) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In that case Howie AJ (with whom Handley AJA agreed, Adams J dissenting in the outcome) said at [103]-[104]:

""The common law did not specifically identify as an aggravating factor that an offence was committed in the presence of a child, so no guidance is given to how the section should be interpreted from that source. However, it is not difficult to appreciate that the provision in s 21A(2)(ea) is principally aimed at the deleterious effect that the commission of a crime, particularly one of violence, might have on the emotional wellbeing of a child. The commission of the offence may also be deleterious to the child's moral values. It does not matter whether the offender is a parent of the child or not, although if it is a parent this will be particularly aggravating. I accept that generally the supply of drugs in the presence of a child would be a factor of aggravation. Again whether such a factor is aggravating in a particular case and how aggravating it is, will depend upon the nature of the offence charged and the likelihood that the child will be affected by it, having regard to all the circumstances including the child's age. No regard seems to have been given to such considerations in this case either by the parties or the court.

But attention must be given to the words actually used in the aggravating factor in the provision, the policy behind it and the fact that the Crown is to prove a matter of aggravation beyond reasonable doubt. As Adams J points out, there was no evidence that any offence had been committed in the presence of Ms Hunter's son. The evidence given by Ms Hunter, as set out in the judgment of Adams J, could not have supported the allegation and yet the prosecutor was prepared to leave the evidence in that state.""

29Although Adams J was in dissent with regard to the outcome of that case, his Honour made similar observations to those of Howie AJ at [89]:

""Furthermore, the finding that the offences were carried out 'in company, in the presence of the offender's teenage son' was not only not alleged by the Crown but was not justified by the evidence. In this respect the applicant said that her son was living with her 'at the time of these drug offences' and agreed that he had been 'exposed ... to drug supply'. I do not see that this was an admission that he had actually been present when drugs were supplied, still less that he was present when the offences for which she was charged had occurred. Nor did the Crown prosecutor question her about these possibilities. There is no mention in the police facts that her son was present at the time of the offences for which the applicant was charged. There was therefore no evidentiary basis for a finding under s 21(2)(ea) of the Sentencing Act that the offences were 'committed in the presence of a child under 18 years of age'. Had the applicant been charged with an offence under s 36Z of the Act of organising or conducting or (perhaps more appropriately) assisting in organising or conducting any drug premises then, if the child had access to the premises and, as a consequence of that access was exposed to a prohibited drug or 'a drug supply process' two offences would have been committed and the offender would have been liable, for a first offence, to a maximum penalty of 60 penalty points and/or imprisonment for 14 months. However, the applicant was not charged with that offence and, even if there was evidence justifying conviction of it, could not be sentenced for it.""

30The observations of Howie AJ extracted above were recently quoted with approval by Price J in R v Seymour at [43]. On the evidence in that particular matter, his Honour was not satisfied that the aggravating feature had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. 

31Turning to this matter, as to the third count, there was evidence on which it might have been open to her Honour to find that the child must have realised what was happening in his room even though he did not see the events. However, her Honour did not make such a finding and it follows that her Honour erred in taking into account that the offence was committed in the presence of the child, for that is what ""generalised"" presence must be taken to mean.

32As for the other offences, there was no direct evidence of the presence of a child. Although the remarks on sentence have a degree of ambiguity about them, I am prepared to accept the propositions of counsel for the applicant that her Honour did take the presence of the child into account as an aggravating feature; that her Honour did so with regard to those two offences as well; and that, applying the strict approach of this Court in Gore v R; Hunter v R to the question, that was an error.

33In short, I would uphold ground one. Whether a lesser sentence should be imposed by this Court as a result of that finding is another question entirely, to which I shall return later.

Ground three
""The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.""

Background and submissions

34Counsel for the applicant accepted that a sentence of imprisonment was open to the discretion of her Honour. However, she submitted that the sentences, both individually and in the aggregate, are erroneously severe. 

35She invited attention to the fact that the actual bodily harm inflicted on two occasions was at the lower end of the range, and required neither hospitalisation nor long-term treatment. The other offence featured no physical consequences.

36She also submitted that evidence before her Honour showed that the applicant is in truth a person of potential, who possesses very sound prospects for rehabilitation and who, at the time sentence, had already taken constructive steps to address his criminality.

37Counsel for the applicant referred to a table of decisions of this Court with regard to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. She submitted that that table demonstrates that the sentences imposed are manifestly excessive.

38The Crown submitted that the sentences were open to the discretion of her Honour, for the following reasons.

39First, although the physical injury may not have been great, the psychological injury was substantial.

40Secondly, the applicant had a prior conviction for an assault on a previous partner.

41Thirdly, her Honour found that, in light of his past behaviour, the prospects of rehabilitation of the applicant were in truth not good.

42Fourthly, a decision had been taken by the Crown to have the matter dealt with in the District Court, where there were, of course, maximum penalties higher than the jurisdictional limits that would have pertained if the matters had been dealt with in the Local Court.

43Fifthly, the pleas of guilty were entered on the day that the matter was listed for trial. 

44Sixthly, her Honour found that the applicant had a propensity to commit acts of violence against women, and in light of his history that finding was open.

45Seventhly, counts 2 and 3 were committed in breach of a bond for an offence of violence against the same victim imposed months before. They were also committed in breach of an AVO with regard to the same victim imposed at the same time. Those were serious aggravating features that were appropriately reflected in the sentences imposed.

46Eighthly, special circumstances were found, affording the applicant a degree of leniency.

47Ninthly, no complaint had been or could be made about the structure of the sentences.

Determination

48The approach of this Court to men who assault vulnerable women is well established and need not be elaborated upon by me: see R v Edigarov [2001] NSWCCA 436; (2001) 125 A Crim R 551, R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 41; (2004) 144 A Crim R 180, and R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; (2006) 164 A Crim R 179. 

49It is enough to say that, if an offender sees fit repeatedly to visit violence upon a woman in breach of a bond and an apprehended violence order imposed months before with regard to the same behaviour and the same victim, he should expect to be imprisoned, and not for an insubstantial period.

50The table of cases with regard to assault occasioning actual bodily harm is helpful, but not determinative. In particular, it does not reveal whether those applicants promptly breached a bond and an AVO imposed with regard to violence against the same victim. 

51Finally, with regard to count 1, although luckily no serious physical injury was inflicted in this case, I consider that pulling a person off a bed by his or her feet is a very dangerous and frightening thing to do.

52I respectfully reject the proposition that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, whether individually or in the aggregate. I consider that they were well open to the discretion of her Honour.

53It follows that I would reject ground two.

Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act with regard to ground one

54As against the possibility that error were established, counsel for the applicant read an affidavit detailing the progress of the applicant since he has been imprisoned. It shows that the applicant has been an excellent worker; has maintained his physical health; and has accommodation and immediate employment with his band available to him when he is released. He has also taken steps in custody to deal with his issues with alcohol. Finally, the evidence shows that the pending appeal of the applicant has blocked his progress to C3 classification.

55The applicant is to be commended on the steps towards rehabilitation he has undertaken in custody since the date of sentence. But nothing in that material, or in any of the objective and subjective material before her Honour, dissuades me from my affirmative satisfaction that no lesser sentence is warranted in law for these offences, whether individually or in the aggregate.

One final matter

56Counsel for the applicant requested that this Court recommend to the Department of Corrective Services that a different approach be taken to the classification of prisoners who have an appeal to this Court pending. But I consider that we are not in a position to do so, knowing as we do nothing of the background of or reasons for policies and decisions to do with classification, whether generally or in particular cases.

Orders

57I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed. 


58BARR AJ: I agree with Button J.

2706509,R v McKellar [2013] NSWSC 896,"Judgment

1The accused, Shane Thomas McKellar, has been charged with the murder of Mr Bruce Wentworth Delany at Bourke on 21 May 2011, the armed robbery with the infliction of serious bodily harm upon the same victim on the same day, and possessing the proceeds of crime. For the second time, a question has been raised concerning the accused's fitness to be tried.

2He was found fit to be tried following an inquiry before Latham J late last year: R v McKellar [2012] NSWSC 1567. Her Honour provided a summary of the Crown case (at [2]) and of the principles which apply to the determination of a question of fitness to be tried (at [3]-[4]). It is unnecessary that I repeat those matters. 

The accused is unrepresented

3I should explain how it is that a question of fitness to be tried has been raised again.

4Sometime after the fitness hearing before Latham J had concluded, the accused withdrew his instructions from Mr Bill Walsh of counsel and Mr Rolfe, solicitor.

5Legal Aid NSW then agreed to assign the matter to another solicitor and barrister. Mr Boyden, solicitor, and Mr Luke Brasch of counsel were engaged. 

6A trial date was set by Latham J on 1 February 2013. The trial was due to commence at Orange on 1 July 2013.

7In the week commencing 3 June 2013, the Crown Prosecutor received notification that the accused had withdrawn instructions from Mr Boyden and Mr Brasch.

8The matter came before me on 14 June 2013. By that stage, Ms Davenport SC had been briefed to appear, the matter having again been assigned by Legal Aid NSW, this time to Blair Criminal Lawyers. Ms Davenport had only just received the brief and had not met the accused prior to 14 June. She saw him in the cells after the court had risen (contrary to what the accused later claimed). The trial date of 1 July 2013 was confirmed.

9Mr Blair and one of his employed solicitors, Mr Mallinson, went to see the accused on Sunday 23 June 2013. I have been told that they spent some two and half hours with him, during the course of which they explored the Presser criteria and satisfied themselves that the accused remained fit to be tried. 

10On Thursday 27 June, Ms Davenport and Mr Blair went to the gaol for a conference. The accused indicated that he was not happy with Ms Davenport appearing for him and he refused to provide Mr Blair with any instructions. He walked out of the conference. On the basis that Mr McKellar was not prepared to provide any instructions, Ms Davenport and Mr Blair felt that they had no option but to seek to withdraw.

11Because of this development, the matter was listed before me in Sydney at midday on Friday 28 June. Ms Davenport appeared, with Mr Mallinson, on an amicus curiae basis and confirmed what had occurred since 14 June. 

12When I came on the bench last Friday, I was informed by Corrective Services staff that the accused was refusing to come into court. A short time later, however, he did come into court. He was quite vocal and hostile. He confirmed his dissatisfaction with Ms Davenport and Mr Mallinson representing him and indicated a preference for Mr Blair to appear. That is inconsistent with this attitude to Mr Blair the previous day. He was informed that his trial would be proceeding at Orange this week. After some further discussion he walked out of court and thereafter refused to return.

13When the matter was first mentioned before me on Monday of this week at Orange, the accused appeared unrepresented. He had been spoken to earlier in the cells by Mr Arjun Chhabra, a solicitor from the Aboriginal Legal Service (""ALS""). It was hoped that he would be able to get through to the accused the importance of him having legal representation. But, Mr Chhabra's discussions with the accused were unfruitful. He returned to speak with the accused on Tuesday morning but with much the same result.

14When the matter was first before me on Monday, I allowed the accused considerable latitude to ventilate whatever it was that concerned him. He spoke at some length. Most of it appeared, at face value at least, irrelevant. Eventually he seemed to be prepared to reconsider his position and indicated that he was prepared to re-engage with Ms Davenport and Mr Mallinson who, I was informed, were willing to come back into the matter. They were available to attend upon the accused at Bathurst gaol on Tuesday for a conference with a view to potentially commencing with the trial on Wednesday.

15That is where the matter stood when I adjourned on Monday morning. Later in the day it was indicated by the Crown Prosecutor the better course would be for the accused to be brought to court at Orange so that a conference could proceed in the cells for as long as was required.

16The accused was brought back up to court to be informed of this. He indicated that he would not be coming back to Orange. He then proceeded to deliver a tirade of offensive abuse directed at me and at others in the courtroom at a high volume and in an aggressive tone.

17Ms Davenport and Mr Mallinson travelled to Orange on Tuesday and saw the accused in the cells around the middle of the day. He refused to speak to them.

18So, the position is that the accused is unrepresented and there is no present likelihood of that situation changing. I think that it is safe to assume that he cannot afford to pay for representation himself. Legal Aid has refused to fund any further assignment of his case, and that is understandable, given that he has withdrawn instructions from two previous pairs of lawyers and has refused to provide instructions to the latest pair. There is a possibility that the ALS may be able to act for him but that is not assured. But in any event, the accused has refused to speak to the solicitor sent to Orange on their behalf. 

A question of fitness to be tried

19The Crown Prosecutor indicated on Tuesday afternoon that there appeared to be, once again, a question as to the accused's fitness to be tried. Pursuant to s 8(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), I determined that an inquiry should be conducted and it was conducted forthwith. Ms Davenport and Mr Mallinson were retained by Legal Aid to appear for the accused.

20The question of fitness has arisen, not because of any known change in the mental capacity of the accused, but because it seemed to be the case that the previous finding of fitness was made upon an assumption that he was to be represented at his trial. A different view might be taken if that were not the case.

Evidence

21The Crown tendered, without objection, a folder of reports by various experts which was Exhibit A in the proceedings before Latham J. Also tendered was the transcript of those proceedings as well as an email from Dr Lisa Brown, forensic psychiatrist, sent to the Crown on 2 July 2013 at 3.45pm.

22Counsel confined their submissions to referring me to specific passages in some of the reports and the evidence given before Latham J. Although the evidence is summarised usefully in her Honour's judgment, I have nonetheless read all of the material. I will make brief reference to some of it.

23Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, indicated in his report of 23 July 2012 that the accused suffers from schizophrenia, characterised by auditory hallucinations, ideas of reference and persecutory delusions. He felt that psychosis interfered with the quality of his interaction with others and that he suffered from active symptoms of a chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder that impact upon his capacity to engage. 

24Dr Allnutt thought the accused probably had an underlying cognitive capacity to understand court processes in general but that his auditory hallucinations are of a nature and severity that they impact on his capacity to engage in assessment. Dr Allnutt thought that this would pose the same problem for his legal representatives. He believed that the accused was unfit to stand trial because he would be unable to communicate qualitatively with his legal representatives, to conduct a defence or to follow proceedings. Dr Allnutt concluded that report by indicating that the opinions he had expressed were preliminary and that he would like the opportunity to review the records of Justice Health to see the views of other clinicians before arriving at a final conclusion. 

25I note that Dr Allnutt has recorded that the accused is unable to read or write. The doctor was of the view that there was at least a mild intellectual impairment.

26By the time he came to give evidence before Latham J, Dr Allnutt had been given the opportunity to read the Justice Health records. He maintained his view that the accused was unfit to stand trial. He accepted that there was likely a degree of malingering or exaggerating of symptoms. He accepted that it was possible that, if the Court concluded that the accused was not in fact experiencing psychotic symptoms, or was exaggerating their extent, his motive might be to avoid a trial.

27He also accepted that ""in a short trial that's not complex, you might regard him as fit""; but he immediately added, ""in a longer trial [that is, anything over a week] with greater complexity, a greater degree of engagement is required and concentration, there's cause for concern here"".

28There was an exchange with the Crown Prosecutor about the length and complexity of the prospective trial. It appeared during the course of that exchange that the trial would be of no more than four weeks duration. It would involve about a dozen civilian witnesses who observed various things. It would also include the usual kind of crime scene and forensic pathology evidence as well as DNA evidence.

29Dr Gary Banks, a consultant clinical psychologist, provided a report and gave evidence before Latham J. The view he formed upon clinical assessment was strengthened by material he subsequently read in contemporaneous Justice Health records. The accused had been held at the Long Bay Prison Hospital for the previous six weeks and Dr Banks said:

I think there is ample evidence across that 6 week duration of the nursing notes recorded that each of the Presser criteria would be met quite clearly and consistently over time.

30A report by Dr Lisa Brown, dated 22 August 2012, was before Latham J. She expressed the view that ""malingering of memory problems, in the context of him facing a very serious charge, is suggested by Mr McKellar's current presentation"". She noted that there were comments to this effect made by Woods DCJ when sentencing the accused in 2007. His Honour referred to the accused being of ""below average intelligence but not as severely intellectually disabled as he wished to portray"". Dr Brown also referred to the acknowledgement by Dr Allnutt that there may be a degree of exaggeration in the accused's presentation.

31Dr Brown's report does not contain an explicit and unequivocal expression of opinion that the accused was fit to be tried but she confirmed in her oral evidence before Latham J that this was her belief. She said in the report that ""allowing him brief periods of time out from the courtroom setting would probably assist him during the court process"". A variety of examples were given in the course of Dr Brown's evidence of the accused having a memory capacity that exceeded that which he sought to portray. 

32There is a particularly significant passage in the evidence of Dr Brown:

Q. Doctor, given the anticipate length of such a trial of four to six weeks, do you think that considering Mr McKellar, the accused would be able to give his legal advisers proper instructions over that period of time?
A. Yes. As his mental state is currently, as I mentioned he is probably at the best he's been for some time. He's not going to be as affected by side effects because he's on reduced medication so he's less likely to be restless and better able to concentrate. But because of his marked cognitive impairment, which has been documented, he may need additional assistance from counsel to go over information, to allow him additional time, and to keep in mind that he does require some additional support and information to best cooperate. 

Q. Would you agree he has a degree of cognitive impairment?
A. It's marked and it's what a psychiatrist would deem as borderline to marked. So it's in the mildest category of intellectual disability.

Q. With that in mind, would he have difficulty in following the proceedings in court?
A. It's possible he could particularly as it relates to more complex material. In that type of situation he would need explanation and going over of information. (27.11.12 at T12) (Emphasis added)

33Dr Brown had previous involvement with the accused. She provided a report in 2007 on his fitness to be tried in criminal proceedings then pending in the District Court. Her opinion then included:

Based on the examination of Mr McKellar, it is my opinion that he is currently fit to plead, if certain provisions are made for him to have a support person available and which would help to offset some of the intellectual difficulties which may affect his concentration and capacity to understand the trial process in an adequate manner.

...

Whilst Mr McKellar is likely to be at the lower end of the spectrum of fitness based on his intellectual difficulties the assistance of either his legal counsel and/or an Aboriginal support worker would be of particular benefit in helping him to follow the court process at the time. Without such support, Mr McKellar may possibly fall below the level required to adequately understand and involve himself in the trial process.

34The reports and the evidence that were before Latham J last year lead me to conclude that a finding that the accused is fit to be tried would be dependent upon him having available to him (a) legal representation, and (b) steps taken during the course of a trial to assist him in following the proceedings and understanding the substantial effect of any evidence given against him. This appears to be implicit in her Honour's conclusions. There was competing evidence before her but it seems that each of the experts proceeded upon an assumption that the accused would be legally represented. Her Honour found that the accused was, on the balance of probabilities, fit to be tried. But she said (at [51]):

I recognise that he may require additional adjournments to those usually granted to allow his counsel to communicate effectively with him and manage his anxiety around court proceedings.

35Her Honour also recognised a need for the accused to continue to be assessed and medicated, adding (at [53]), ""his long-standing history of mental illness strongly suggests that it will wax and wane over time"". 

Determination

36I am unaware of what has transpired, if anything, in terms of assessment and medication since her Honour gave judgment last December, some six and a half months ago. 

37Subject to that, however, it is my impression that there is force in the suggestion that the accused has exaggerated his claimed memory deficits in the past. The reports are replete with examples of him claiming an inability to remember things, including what he was charged with. But in the proceedings before me he has indicated in a number of ways that his capacity for memory is quite reasonable.

38It might be a concern that the accused told Dr Allnutt that he could not read or write. However, he spoke to me on 28 June and on 1 July about having filled out forms and how he had photocopies of various papers. On occasions he brought a sheath of papers with him into court; papers which would be of no use to him if he could not read them.

39It is clear that the accused has a mental illness. There is no dispute about that, although questions are raised about the accuracy of his claims about the symptoms. How he is functioning in terms of this illness at the present time, as compared with when he was assessed by the various experts who gave evidence before Latham J, is impossible for me to determine. There is no evidence before me in that respect. 

40Dr Allnutt acknowledged that ""a reasonable explanation for the accused's behaviour is that he may view his mental illness and his symptoms as a way of avoiding the trial process"". Whether this is what is occurring now is difficult to know but it cannot be dismissed.

41Accepting those difficulties, I would nevertheless incline to the view that without legal representation the accused is unfit to be tried. 

42It seems that he has the capacity to read, but his skills are likely rudimentary. That raises a question of his ability to comprehend to a sufficient degree the nature of the evidence that the Crown intends to call. 

43The accused's intellectual capacity is at a reduced level, but is not as inadequate as he at times has sought to portray. However, there must be a real question about his ability to understand the effect of evidence that will be given in the trial, particularly by experts in the fields of forensic biology and forensic pathology.

44A matter that is difficult to assess because of the malingering aspect reported by the experts is the accused's ability to focus upon relevant issues in his defence. He has sought to tell me of his concerns about some event, or events, which occurred in gaol which he has wanted lawyers to pursue for the purpose of the trial. As best as I can understand, such events have nothing to do with the issues in the trial at all. 

45The accused is, at times, quite agitated and occasionally hostile. This highlights another problem with the accused conducting his own defence. It may be that his apparently volatile emotional state might distract him from following and understanding the evidence.

46The matter that I find decisive on the question of the accused's present fitness to be tried is a short email that the Crown Prosecutor received from Dr Brown. It appears that Latham J preferred the evidence of Dr Brown to that of Dr Allnutt; it tipped the scales on the balance of probabilities sufficiently for her Honour to find the accused fit to be tried. But Dr Brown was provided with transcript of the proceedings before me. She advised:

I would no longer be prepared to support Mr McKellar as being fit to stand trial if he chooses to represent himself without legal representation. The factors which would affect his capacity to do so would include his limited cognitive skills in dealing with complex materials. In addition, the transcripts reveal that Mr McKellar is currently in a highly aroused emotional state and which impair his ability to reason and consider how to make a defence. His fitness to stand trial is therefore restricted to the situation of him having the assistance of counsel.

47I was also informed by the Crown Prosecutor that Dr Brown had indicated to him that, from her reading of the transcripts, the accused's thought processes appeared to be more disorganised than on the occasions she had seen him last year.

48It is unusual in my experience for a fitness hearing to be conducted on the basis of a contemporaneous opinion of only one expert psychiatrist. However, I am confident that Dr Allnutt would remain of the view, and perhaps be more confident of the view, that he expressed before Latham J that the accused is unfit to be tried. Dr Brown now shares that opinion.

49I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused is unfit to be tried. This is particularly so in relation to his ability to understand the substantial effect of evidence to be given against him and his ability to make his answer to the charge.

Orders

50I find the accused unfit to be tried.

In accordance with s 14 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), I refer this matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 

The accused is remanded in custody until the determination of the Tribunal has been given effect to.

I direct the court registry to provide the following documentation to the Tribunal:

a copy of this judgment;

a copy of the warrant committing the accused to a correctional centre;

a transcript of the proceedings before Latham J on 27 November 2012 and Exhibit A in those proceedings;

the judgment of Latham J: R v McKellar [2012] NSWSC 1567;

a transcript of the proceedings before me on 14 and 28 June 2013 and 1 and 2 July 2013;

a copy of Exhibit A in the proceedings before me on 2 July 2013; and

a copy of the Crown Case Statement.

2706511,Bamblett v R [2013] NSWCCA 161,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL : I agree with Latham J.

2LATHAM J : The applicant, Graeme Bamblett, seeks leave to appeal a sentence imposed upon him by Colefax SC DCJ, following a plea of guilty, with respect to one count of aggravated break and enter with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely to steal, in circumstances of aggravation. The circumstances of aggravation were that the occupants of the home, entered by the applicant, were asleep in their beds in the early hours of the morning of the offence. 

3The applicant received a sentence of 4 years and 6 months, with a non parole period of 3 years and 4 months. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. 

4The grounds of appeal are that his Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances and that the sentence is manifestly excessive. The first ground arises in part from the fact that the offence was committed in breach of parole, so that the sentence was partially accumulated upon the sentence that the applicant was serving following the revocation of parole. 

5For the reasons which follow, I am of the view that the appeal is wholly without merit and I would refuse leave.

The Offence

6At about 4:30 am on 22 July 2011, the applicant climbed onto the balcony and opened a closed window in the kitchen of a home in Five Dock. The applicant began searching the house. He took a set of spare house keys from the kitchen bench, gained access to the study and took a screwdriver from that room. The applicant then left the study and went to the bedroom, which was occupied by a Mr and Mrs Joyce, who were asleep at the time. 

7The applicant took two phone chargers. While the applicant was still in the bedroom, Mrs Joyce went to the adjoining bathroom, causing the applicant to secrete himself in the corner of the room. A short time later Mr Joyce woke and discovered the applicant, who attempted to flee the premises. Both Mr and Mrs Joyce detained the applicant and walked him into the hallway, where he continued to struggle. Mr Joyce called out to his son for assistance. All three attempted to restrain the applicant who was attempting to leave the house by the front door. Ultimately the applicant stop resisting and sat on the lounge while the police were contacted. 

8On hearing sirens in the street outside, the applicant requested to be allowed outside for a cigarette. The applicant then fled the premises by climbing down the balcony and running down the street, away from the arriving police vehicles. 

9When police arrived at the home they were provided with a description of the applicant. Mr and Mrs Joyce told the police of a distinctive tattoo between the thumb and index finger of the applicant's right hand. The applicant's fingerprints were subsequently obtained from inside the window seal of the premises. 

10On 27 July 2011 a search warrant was executed at the applicant's address in Belmore in the absence of the applicant. On 3 August 2011, police attended the applicant's address, and identified themselves to him. After a further attempt at flight, the applicant was arrested.

The Applicant's Criminal History

11The applicant is presently 29 years of age. The applicant reportedly commenced using heroin at the age of 14. His criminal history, which begins in 1999, consists primarily of drug-related offences, assaults, frauds and property related offences. The presentence report before his Honour noted that the applicant had previously breached a community service order (in 2005) and committed an aggravated sexual assault with the infliction of actual bodily harm in 2009, while he was on parole with respect to various property offences.

12The applicant has never been in employment. He told the Probation and Parole officer that he was not interested in completing a residential treatment program and that he had never attended any intervention for drug or alcohol issues. To the extent that the applicant has been on the methadone program for his opiate dependency, that has been provided during his periods of incarceration. However, the applicant said that he did not want to be dependent on methadone because he believed that it caused him to relapse. The applicant acknowledged that he committed the offence in order to obtain money for drugs.

13It was in this context that the judge noted that the applicant was on parole for three serious offences, namely aggravated sexual assault, aggravated enter dwelling and commit serious indictable offence and aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, at the time of the commission of the instant offence. The applicant was released to parole on 12 July 2011, namely 10 days before the commission of the offence.

14The applicant's parole was revoked on 18 August 2011. The balance of parole is to expire on 23 December 2013. The judge noted that the applicant had spent no part of the last eight months in custody solely referable to the instant offence.

15The judge commenced the sentence that he imposed from 3 August 2012, one year after the applicant's arrest on the present charge. It follows that slightly less than half of the non-parole period imposed runs concurrently with the balance of parole.

Ground 1 : No Finding of Special Circumstances

16The thrust of the applicant's argument on this ground was that special circumstances ought to have been found by his Honour, in line with ""conventional sentencing practice"" (Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282 at [36]) where sentences are accumulated, either upon each other or upon the balance of parole.

17The argument was refined somewhat on the hearing of the appeal. The applicant contended that, whilst it was not incumbent on his Honour to find special circumstances, it was nonetheless necessary to consider special circumstances in the context of accumulation. The applicant complains that the effective non-parole period is now 85% of the sentence being served.

18To the extent that the applicant now contends that the error consists of the sentencing judge's failure to turn his attention to the effect of accumulation of the sentence on the balance of parole, the applicant relies upon Howie J's remarks in Hejazi (Hislop J agreeing) and upon Adams J (Basten JA and Barr J agreeing) in Haines v R [2008] NSWCCA 12. Both of those cases recognise that ultimately, a finding of special circumstances is dependent upon the circumstances of each case.

19In Hejazi, the full context of Howie J's remarks are :-

35. ..................In my opinion a judge is required in a case such as the present to consider the relationship between the period to be served before parole eligibility arising from the accumulation of the two sentences and the balance of the term of the sentence for the second offence in order to ensure a sufficient period of parole supervision. 
36 It may be necessary to find special circumstances and reduce the non-parole period imposed on the second offence to bring about that result. This has been conventional sentencing practice in this State since at least 1992: see R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58. However, the ultimate question to be asked is what is the least period the offender is required to serve before being eligible for parole? The answer to that question will depend upon a consideration of all the purposes of punishment and not simply the rehabilitation of the offender.

20In Haines, the full conext is (at [21]) :-

It is clear that, where the effect of accumulating sentences is to increase the proportion of the aggregate sentence to be served before the offender is eligible for parole beyond the s 44(2) ratio, this will be a special circumstance justifying a variation of that proportion in respect of one or more of the sentences to bring the relationship between the effective non-parole period and the overall sentence in conformity with the statutory ratio. For this purpose, consideration should be given not only to the accumulation of the sentences being imposed by the sentencing judge but also any sentence or sentences then being served by the offender. In the ordinary course, it will be appropriate to make such adjustments as will bring the ratio between the effective non-parole period and the overall sentence into conformity with the statutory ratio. This may not be appropriate in every case but, where there is a significant effective departure from the statutory ratio, some explanation should be given for doing so.

21In Clare v R [2008] NSWCCA 30 ; 181 A Crim R 450, the Court intervened to adjust the ratio between the non parole period and the sentence imposed for manslaughter, in circumstances where the accumulation of that sentence upon other sentences imposed in the District Court had not been drawn to the judge's attention. The Court was of the view that ""consideration should have been given to this issue."" (at [39])

22There is nothing in Barrett v R [2011] NSWCCA 213 that adds anything to the above decisions. Justice Hidden (Whealy JA and Johnson J agreeing) reiterated at [29] that where the proportion between the aggregate non parole period and the aggregate sentence exceeds 75%, the failure to provide reasons might justify an inference that the effect of accumulation was overlooked.

23I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to turn his attention to the effect of accumulation of the sentence on the balance of parole. In the course of the sentencing proceedings, a report under the hand of John Taylor, psychologist, was tendered on the applicant's behalf. It noted that the applicant had a high to moderate risk of recidivism. This opinion was the subject of comment by his Honour during an exchange with the applicant's legal representative, who said :-

All I'm saying to your Honour is that your Honour wouldn't give him a sentence starting 12 December 2013, you'd have to give him some partial accumulation at least.

24The judge stood the matter over for a further nine days because he required time to think about the appropriate sentence. During his remarks on sentence, his Honour noted that ""no submission was made that there should be a finding of special circumstances [and that] the facts do not call for such a finding."" The judge also found that there was an absence of genuine remorse, no evidence supporting the applicant's assertion that he was ""at the crossroads"", and that the applicant had a long untreated history of polydrug abuse. His Honour then found that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were not good. No issue is taken with these findings.

25In short, the applicant's poor prospects of rehabilitation did not call for a period of conditional liberty any greater than one year and two months. The discussion concerning the commencement date of the sentence necessarily highlighted the issue of accumulation. Clearly, the question of special circumstances was adverted to by the judge.

26In any event, as was observed in Russell v R [2010] NSWCCA 248, by Price J (Campbell JA and myself agreeing) at [43] :-

Whether or not special circumstances are found is a matter for the discretion of a sentencing judge. For the applicant to succeed on this ground, he must show that it was not open to the Judge to reach the decision that he did: Musgrove v R per Simpson J at [24]; R v El-Hayek (2004) 144 A Crim R 90.

27The applicant has not demonstrated that the decision of the sentencing judge was not open to him. 

Ground 2 : Manifest Excess

28A starting point of six years imprisonment for an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years, in circumstances where the offence was committed in breach of parole (relating to a number of similar offences), where the offender had failed to benefit from conditional liberty on other occasions, and where the prospects of rehabilitation were poor, cannot, in my view, be characterised as manifestly excessive.

29The applicant maintained that the objective gravity of the offence was ""low"", having regard to the absence of planning or organisation, elderly, sick or disabled residents, and vandalism or significant damage. The applicant also submitted that the fact that there was only one offence and that it was ""not a repeat incursion into the property"" somehow affected the objective gravity of what the applicant did. 

30I do not understand how the objective gravity of an offence can be assessed by what an offender does not do : Mammone v R [2013] NSWCCA 95 at [35]. The submission that ""the occupants were clearly not terrorised by the situation"" has no foundation in the evidence and is contrary to the judge's finding that ""the experience would no doubt have been a frightening one [and] it is likely to have been accompanied by a profound sense of violation and insecurity"". 

31The order I propose is that leave be refused.

32BARR AJ : I agree with Latham J.

2706513,R v Jermaine BOLT [2013] NSWSC 895,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1On 15 October 2011, Jermaine Bolt was arrested and charged with murder.  He has been in custody since that date.  Mr Bolt was charged that, on the day of his arrest, namely, 15 October 2011, at Ballina in the State of New South Wales, he murdered Tanya Murray.  The offence arose out of an incident of domestic violence.  The deceased, Tanya Murray, was Mr Bolt's partner.  
Circumstances of the Offence
2Jermaine Bolt was born on 25 November 1984 and was 26 at the time of the offence.  The deceased, Tanya Murray, was born on 14 October 1982 and was 29 at the time of her death.  
3The offender and the deceased had been in a de facto relationship and lived in the Armidale area until they moved, approximately 12 months before the incident, to Ballina.  During the course of their relationship, the deceased had complained to members of her family, on more than one occasion, that she had been assaulted by Mr Bolt.  The deceased had been observed with injuries consistent with her complaints.  On the other hand, on a number of occasions, Mr Bolt had called the police to the Ballina address to remove the deceased, who was intoxicated and abusive towards Mr Bolt.  
4On 14 October 2011, Mr Bolt and Ms Murray were celebrating Ms Murray's birthday at home.  They both drank large quantities of alcohol and smoked cannabis.  At the time that Ms Murray died, each of them were intoxicated.  The deceased's blood alcohol reading at post-mortem was 0.148g/100ml and the vitreous humor alcohol reading was 0.182g/100ml.  The anti-psychotic drug, quetiapine was also present within the therapeutic range.  A number of people attended during the afternoon each of whom has provided a witness statement that is in evidence before the Court.  The summary of facts for sentence is agreed between the parties and reflects those statements. 
5The deceased was upset and jealous.  It is not absolutely clear what the reason was for those feelings. A number of possible reasons have been given relating, amongst other things, to the manner in which Mr Bolt was celebrating her birthday and the misreading by the deceased of a message on Mr Bolt's phone.  It matters not what the reason was.  The deceased became aggressive and started to argue with Mr Bolt.  The deceased started pushing Mr Bolt around and pushed him in the face.  She also slapped another person a number of times.  The argument between the deceased and Mr Bolt escalated from time-to-time and sometimes died down only to escalate again.  
6Mr Bolt contacted 000 at approximately 1.39am on 15 October stating that the deceased was ""going to die"" and that he was ""resuscitating her"".  He admitted that he had ""hit her"".  The emergency call has been heard by the Court and the transcript is before me.  
7Before that call the incidents, briefly summarised, involved both the deceased and Mr Bolt drinking heavily: both beer and spirits.  They were also smoking cannabis.  During the course of the afternoon, Mr Bolt and another went for more alcohol and on their return, the deceased started to get wild and argued with Mr Bolt.  The deceased pushed Mr Bolt around and, as earlier stated, pushed him in the face.  Two of the people left shortly thereafter.  During the next part of this altercation Mr Bolt was defensive and seeking to parry the assault from the deceased.  
8During the course of the argument things turned.  At one stage the deceased went into her room, seemingly to calm down.  
9The deceased came out of her room and joined Mr Bolt and others in the lounge room.  At that stage, the deceased seemed all right and was not fighting with Mr Bolt.  Later, the deceased slapped Mr Bolt again, during which time Mr Bolt was trying to cover his face with his hands.  
10At one stage Mr Bolt pushed the deceased in the chest with two open hands.  She fell over, got to her feet and walked towards Mr Bolt.  
11Mr Bolt punched the deceased in the jaw with a closed right fist as a result of which the deceased fell backwards and hit her head on the lino floor.  A witness suggests that the deceased's head hit the ground hard.  She did not move for about 30 seconds.  After that she started to move; seemingly started to wake up and sat up.  Blood was coming from her mouth and the back of her head.  There was blood on the floor in the hallway.  Her hair at the back of her head was covered in blood and the blood was dripping down the back of her shirt.  The deceased and Mr Bolt were yelling at each other. 
12The Crown describes the evidence of the altercations as in three phases, with which description I agree.  The first phase seemed to occur sometime between 6.00pm and 8.00pm and involved the argument over the text message, to which reference has been made.  The second phase occurred between 8.00pm and prior to the arrival of two female guests.  The third phase occurred after the arrival of those guests.  
13The deceased was the aggressor in the first and second phase, the offender, Mr Bolt, was the aggressor in the third phase.  There was a rising level of violence.  
14Later in the evening there was more violence, seemingly at a time when there was no one else present.  A number of explanations have been given.  Some of those explanations are plainly wrong.  
15At a very early stage, Mr Bolt suggested that the injuries were occasioned during the course of ""rough sex"".  I reject that explanation.  
16The injuries sustained by the deceased were extensive.  
17As earlier stated, Mr Bolt rang emergency services.  He was plainly distraught.  He requested someone to come quickly and not to let her die.  He told the operator that he had hit the deceased, when asked how she was hurt.  
18When the police arrived, Mr Bolt was plainly panicked.  He ran to the police vehicle and opened the passenger door before the vehicle had come to a standstill.  Mr Bolt was dressed only in a pair of shorts and had blood over his hands, arms, torso and face.  He said to the police officer: ""I've done it, I've flogged her, I'll do the time just bring her back please.  Quick hurry.""
19Inside the deceased was lying on the floor next to the bed.  Her legs were covered in small bruises and her stomach swollen.  There was bruising along her sides from around her lower back.  Her face was extremely swollen.  Her right and left eyes were swollen shut with swelling around her left eye that was bright red in colour.  She had blood over her head and face and coming from her mouth.  The walls of the room were covered in smeared blood and there was a hole in the southern wall. 
20Mr Bolt offered his hands for arrest, which invitation was not, at that stage, accepted.  The officer checked the deceased, who was not breathing and had no pulse.  The officer commenced chest compressions.  Mr Bolt offered to assist.  Some of those words are significant.  He said: ""Just bring her back; I know I've done the wrong thing.  I flogged her but I love her.  I'm going away for a long time; just save her.""  
21Mr Bolt assisted the police by retrieving a facemask from the police car and, on the material before the Court, there can be no doubt that, whatever was the intention of Mr Bolt at the time that the injuries were occasioned, he genuinely wanted the deceased to live and was genuinely remorseful as to what he had done, even at that early stage. 
22Other police officers arrived.  Mr Bolt offered similar help and pleaded for them to save the deceased.  He made similar comments as to his guilt and his responsibility in the occasioning of the damage.  The police officers advised Mr Bolt of his rights.  He continued to make admissions. 
23Mr Bolt was taken to the police station and again advised of his rights.  It was at this stage that Mr Bolt suggested that they had an argument and were having sex.  Part of his statement was: ""She likes it rough.  I was hitting her around a bit and we fell off the bed.  She has then hit her head on the floor.  I called the police.""
24Notwithstanding this momentary attempt at diverting responsibility, Mr Bolt continued to make statements as to his responsibility and was continuing to desire, genuinely, for the deceased to survive and be well.  He also continued to take general responsibility for the conduct.  
25The deceased passed away at the hospital at approximately 4.51am.  At 6.15am police officers advised Mr Bolt that the deceased had passed away whereupon Mr Bolt became extremely upset and commenced banging his head against the dock wall.  
26At 11.05am on that day Mr Bolt participated in an ERISP (Electronically Recorded Interview of Suspected Person), the terms of which are before the Court.  The deceased was subject to a post-mortem exam, the reports of which are before the Court.  
27The direct cause of death was multiple injuries to the head, thorax and abdomen.  The photographs of the deceased, also before the Court, disclose injuries to the right hand above the right little knuckle area; injury above the right wrist; right inner arm injuries; injury to the right elbow; injuries to the right side of the neck (scratches); injury above the left eye; injuries to the chest; injuries to the left side of the neck; injuries to the left hand above the middle knuckle; injury to the left upper back area; injuries to the left shoulder blade; injuries to the right buttock and injury of the left upper thigh.  The photographs of the crime scene show significant smearing of blood in a number of rooms and beyond the bedroom.  
28Mr Bolt pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity and has accepted responsibility for his conduct and the death of Ms Murray. 
29The pathologist expresses the opinion that there has been a severe degree of force applied, undoubtedly from a combination of factors, and seemingly from punching, kicking or stomping, and possibly being thrown against angled surfaces of furniture or walls.  It seems that the hole in the wall in the bedroom has been caused by Mr Bolt throwing the deceased through the wall.  
30Mr Bolt had consumed large amounts of alcohol and cannabis during the afternoon, evening and night of 14 and 15 October 2011.  He appeared to be drunk to witnesses and was intoxicated late in the morning of 15 October.  The alcohol and cannabis were consumed voluntarily. 
Personal Circumstances of the Offender
31Mr Bolt gave evidence in the sentence proceedings.  There is also a psychologist's report.  It is important to deal with some of the matters that have been disclosed in the psychologist's report.  
32Mr Bolt was born in Lismore, New South Wales.  His mother abused alcohol and he had a series of stepfathers who, while providing some stability in his life, also occasioned domestic violence against his mother.  He lived often or primarily with his maternal grandmother during his very early years, up to the age of five.  He has a number of stepsiblings.  
33Mr Bolt's grandmother was a stable influence in his life, but he had a difficult relationship with his mother.  She was an alcoholic.  She was neglectful and abusive and often his relatives were required to care for him and his sister.  His mother was murdered by her partner in 2008, when Mr Bolt was away, for which Mr Bolt felt and feels responsible in that he feels he could have prevented the incident, if he were to have been there.  
34Mr Bolt has little recollection of his biological father, who left when Mr Bolt was very young and Mr Bolt believes his father is now in gaol for attempting to murder a girlfriend.  Further, Mr Bolt had a conflicted relationship with his various stepfathers, all of whom were abusive to his mother.  
35The psychologist opined in the following terms:
""It is my professional opinion that Mr. Bolt is experiencing significant psychological turmoil at this time and was not malingering for secondary gain. 
... Mr. Bolt's profile indicates a person with a tendency to avoid social connections fearing judgment, rejection or conflict, but who also craves the support.  Their outlook on life tends to be self sacrificing, gloomy and preoccupied with negative events.  Five of the eleven scales [in the testing] were elevated.  
... All three scales [Severe Personality Scales] were elevated to clinical significance, highlighting Mr. Bolt's essential dialectic between suspicion and social detachment, and his desire for positive attachment. 
... Six scales [for measuring transient symptomatology] were elevated to clinical significance relating to symptoms of anxiety, bodily concerns, lability of emotions, alcohol and drug abuse and a significant reaction to trauma.  
... All three scales [Severe Clinical Syndromes] were elevated to clinical significance and relate to depressed, fragmented and persecutory thinking style.
In sum, Mr. Bolt's profile is consistent with his clinical interview in that it showed numerous clinical elevations relating to the dialectics of his life; namely, his desire for closeness and support versus the expectation of abuse or neglect.""
36In her summary and recommendations, Dr McGregor, the registered forensic psychologist, summarised some of the foregoing as having been
""raised in an unstable home life, marred by domestic violence towards his mother, as well as his mother's alcoholism.  He recalled her [his mother's] behaviour as vacillating between neglect and abuse; her behaviour could alternate from kicking Mr. Bolt and his younger step sister out of the home to standing over them with a knife in an alcohol induced rage.  For Mr. Bolt, this resulted in his belief that he had to protect the women in his life, both his sister as well as his mother, not only to protect her from herself, but from the violent men in her life.  Mr. Bolt identified that he came from an environment where violence towards women was not only common, but extreme; he stated his biological father was serving a gaol sentence for attempted murder of his partner, and his stepfather murdered his mother.  Domestic violence was present in each of Mr. Bolt's relationships.  
... 
Mr. Bolt would benefit from further evaluation in two areas.  A psychiatric assessment to explore his assertions that he has had a long history of hearing voices, the potential trauma reaction from his traumatic upbringing and his current suicidal ideations is recommended to formulate a consistent and effective treatment regimen.  As well, a treatment plan should be identified that recites any learning deficits and program needs; domestic violence and drug/alcohol intervention should form the basis of that treating plan."" (Emphasis added.)
37I agree with the assessment of the psychologist. 
38There can be little doubt that Mr Bolt had a dysfunctional childhood and upbringing.  Mr Bolt displays high levels of remorse, but, because of his dysfunctional background and the effect of alcohol and drugs, would not offer good prospects of rehabilitation, unless each of these issues was dealt with by him both in a prison environment and in a longer than usual period of supervision of probation and parole.  Notwithstanding that a long prison sentence must be imposed, I find there are special circumstances that warrant a longer period of supervision in the community so that these issues can be dealt with in an environment which exposes Mr Bolt to the real world.  
Consideration
39As already stated, Mr Bolt is entitled to a discount at the highest end for his plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity.  Mr Bolt was almost 27 at the time that he killed his partner.  His criminal record is not as significant as one could imagine for a person with Mr Bolt's background.  It includes acts of violence (assault occasioning), possession of prohibited drugs, driving whilst disqualified, one offence of break and enter, some offences of common assault and stalk and intimidate.  Previously, his offences have resulted in fines, a bond, or suspended sentences.  Apart from short periods on remand or pending an appeal, this will be the first significant time Mr Bolt will have spent in prison.  
40Mr Bolt has had a number of casual jobs.  When he was working on a fishing boat he saved a person from drowning after the person fell out of another boat for which Mr Bolt was given an award.  
41He commenced abusing alcohol at the age of 15 and commenced smoking cannabis when he was 12.  He now understands that he has a real problem with both alcohol and drugs.  His affidavit warrants, in part, repeating:
""I understand I will be serving a lengthy sentence.  I want to use that time as usefully as I can.  I want to work while I am in gaol, and learn a trade like carpentry if a course is available.  I would also like to finish my Higher School Certificate.  I know I have to do all the rehabilitation courses I can so that I can deal with my alcohol and drug use, and not turn to violence.  I want to learn from my mistakes.  I want to be a father to my nine year old daughter. ... I have not seen [her] since I came into custody.  ... I would like to have a normal life of work, family and home.  While I say this, I understand these are all the things I have taken away from Tanya [the deceased].  
...
I know I have brought terrible sadness into the lives of Tanya's family.  I know how much they loved her.  If I could swap places with Tanya, I would.  I would do anything to stop their heart ache and pain.""
42The injuries that were sustained by the deceased were significant.  There was a significant degree of violence exhibited.  That is disturbing.  Nevertheless, I do not consider that Mr Bolt intended to kill the deceased or wanted her to die, even at the height of the attack.  
43This is a domestic violence situation in which, throughout the afternoon and evening, violence was perpetrated on each side of the relationship.  In some senses, although not of the kind that ameliorates the offence, there was a degree of provocation.  
44I have no doubt that Mr Bolt intended to occasion grievous bodily harm or very serious injury.  I do not find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he intended to kill the deceased.  Indeed, I find that he did not intend so to do. 
45At the time of the offence, Mr Bolt was subject to conditional liberty and was subject to four s 9 Bonds imposed by the Local Court.  He has previously been convicted of offences of violence in a domestic setting.  
46I do not consider that the level of violence involved gratuitous cruelty.  It was certainly cruel.  But it did not suggest that the infliction of pain was an end in itself: see McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94; (2009) 194 A Crim R 439 at [30], per Howie J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed.  In the words of the Court of Criminal Appeal, it is completely unnecessary, in order to form a proper assessment of the seriousness of this crime, inflicted upon Mr Bolt's partner by Mr Bolt, to introduce the concept of gratuitous cruelty.  It adds nothing to the description of what was, plainly, a prolonged assault upon a vulnerable women in her own home by her partner. 
47Fundamental in assessing the combination of objective and subjective factors is the dysfunctional childhood suffered by Mr Bolt.  I agree with Simpson J in R v Millwood [2012] NSWCCA 2 at [69] that a person who has had the start in life that Mr Bolt has does not bear equal moral responsibility with one who has had a ""normal"" or ""advantaged"" upbringing.  ""Common sense and common humanity dictate that such a person will have fewer emotional resources to guide his (or her) behavioural decisions. ... That his background is a relevant consideration affording some (although limited) mitigation is entirely consistent with the approach taken by Wood J (as he then was) in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, a decision which has repeatedly been followed in this Court.""
48I agree with the assessment contained in the submissions made on behalf of Mr Bolt and, in my view, resulting from the limited emotional resources available to him from his background and the degree to which it was affected by constant abuse of women, that Mr Bolt's actions and the fatal assault ""was the result of the inability of the offender to deal with the deceased's emotionally labile state"".  
49The previous personal violence offences are relevant in determining the degree to which specific deterrence and punishment are given a greater preponderance and, in so doing, where, in the range available from the objective circumstances of the offence, the sentence imposed upon Mr Bolt should lie.  
50Nevertheless, Mr Bolt is now medicated and with proper treatment of the kind to which I have referred, offers some prospect of rehabilitation with a positive socially-acceptable future.  
51I assess the objective gravity of the offence as slightly below the mid-range of conduct to which the charge of murder applies. 
52A victim impact statement was read to the Court.  Nothing that the Court can do, or that Mr Bolt can do, will bring the deceased back.  Her family continues to suffer.  This is true of every murder.  Indeed, it is true of every killing occasioned by acts of violence.  
53Murder is the most serious of offences and seen as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar.  It has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 20 years' imprisonment.  A full-time custodial sentence is plainly warranted. 
54Sentencing involves the resolution of goals that pull in different directions and often conflict.  They include the protection of society, the deterrence of the offender, the deterrence of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution or punishment and reform or rehabilitation.  
55As is often stated, the goals overlap and cannot be considered in isolation.  Sometimes even seemingly conflicting goals overlap.  The best means of protecting society is to ensure full rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation is also the single most effective deterrence of the offender committing offences of the same kind.  
56Nevertheless, punishment is required, general deterrence is required and, while hope springs eternal, the reality of sentencing is that rehabilitation is not always successful.  In some cases, such as this, while personal deterrence is, at first blush, an important element, the spontaneous nature of this offence and its lack of premeditation and planning, suggests that no conscious intention has been brought to bear.  The intention to inflict really serious injury was momentary, but fatal.  On the other hand, that spontaneity involves a greater need for the protection of society, at least until such time as society can be confident that rehabilitation has occurred.  
57Sentencing is an intuitive process in which the objective gravity of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender are considered together with the guidepost of the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period in order to arrive at a result that implements the purposes of sentencing to which mention has been made and which are prescribed in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
58As is expressed above, I have had regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, although not by way of checklist.

2706516,AB v R [2013] NSWCCA 160,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with pars [26] and [27] of the judgment of Adams J to the effect that error of the kind identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 did occur. Subject to what follows, however, I am not satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted. As Adams J appreciated in par [36], the sentence imposed is well within the discretionary range. On my analysis of the facts surrounding the offending, that sentence remains appropriate. As Adams J pointed out at par [54] the quantity and purity of the drugs, the role of the offender, the degree of planning and the fact that this was not an isolated transaction but part of a system of trafficking in prohibited and dangerous drugs, leads to that conclusion.

2It follows that I do not agree with his Honour's conclusion at par [60] that in terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 a less severe sentence ""is warranted in law"" and should have been passed. As already indicated, I have reached a different conclusion. I do, however, agree with Adams J that the sentence needs to be adjusted in order to have regard to the period of custody before bail was granted. 

3Accordingly, the orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) Grant leave to appeal.

(2) Allow the appeal.

(3) Quash the sentence in relation to count 2 and substitute the following sentence:

The appellant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months to date from 1 July 2008 and to expire 1 November 2013, with a balance of term of 2 years and 1 month, which will expire on 1 December 2015.

(4) The sentence imposed on 24 February 2012 is varied to commence on 1 November 2013.

4ADAMS J: 

Introduction

5On 18 November 2009 the applicant pleaded guilty to two offences under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 of supplying a prohibited drug, one of which concerned 296.9 grams of 79 per cent pure methylamphetamine (a commercial quantity - I refer to this offence as the commercial supply) and the other 192 grams of 80 per cent pure methylamphetamine (less than a commercial quantity). These offences attract maximum sentences respectively of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years (s 25(2)) and 15 years (s 25(2)). In respect of the latter offence he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years commencing on 2 October 2007 and, in respect of the former, taking into account six offences on a Form 1, he was sentenced to head sentence of 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 5 months commencing on 1 July 2008. The effective sentence was, accordingly, 8 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 6 years and 2 months. The offences on the Form 1 concerned supplies of methylamphetamine (193.9 grams, 83.1 grams, 82.2 grams), the supply of cocaine (38.2 grams) and possession of property reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime ($19,350 and $616,658).

6Whilst the applicant was on remand in relation to all these matters, police conducted searches at the houses of the applicant and his family. These led to the seizure of cash and further charges of dealing with the proceeds of crime. Following a late plea, these charges were dealt with by the same judge who had imposed the earlier sentences. On 17 February 2012, in respect of a charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime ($1,116,980) he was sentenced to an overall sentence of 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months to commence on 1 December 2013, the date immediately following the expiration of the previous non-parole period). Taken into account on a Form 1 were a further three offences of dealing with the proceeds of crime amounting in all to $4,392,300. (This is referred to below as the ""February sentence"".) The sentence reflected a discount of 35 per cent for the plea and pursuant to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

7The resulting combined sentence was an effective head sentence of 9 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months. 

8The applicant seeks leave to appeal only in respect of the sentence for the commercial supply which was imposed on 28 May 2010. The ground of appeal is that the learned sentencing judge erred in the manner in which she had regard to the standard non-parole period applicable to that offence, relying on Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. 

The facts

9These were not in dispute. The following account is taken largely from the sentencing judge's remarks on sentence (omitting quotation marks for ease of reading). 

10On 24 October 2007 W, who had been given $38,550 and fitted with a listening device, went to the applicant's premises and said, in effect, that he wanted 7 ounces of methylamphetamine. The applicant said that he only had 1½ ounces and gave him a sample, retrieving white powder from a hiding place in the garden. W took what he was given to police. It was found to be methylamphetamine weighing 5.13 grams with a purity of 1.5 per cent. Next day, W visited the applicant, taking the money with him and having been fitted with a listening device, told the applicant that he wanted 7 ounces and handed him the cash. The applicant told him to meet him down the road in five minutes. W did so. The applicant handed W a plastic bag which he took to police. The bag was found to contain methylamphetamine weighing 192 grams with a purity of 80 per cent. This was the supply offence of which the applicant pleaded guilty on 18 November 2009.

11Later on that night police officers searched two residential premises. In the roof of the garage at one house they found 296.9 grams of methylamphetamine, some of which had a purity of 79 per cent. This is the commercial supply against the sentence for which the applicant seeks leave to appeal. In the other house they found $616,000, which included the money paid by W and all of which was the proceeds of crime, namely the supply of prohibited drugs. It was during the execution of this search warrant that the applicant was arrested. The approximate street value of the drugs sold to W was $56,000 and those found in the house between $84,000 and $220,675. 

12The following is a brief summary, again not controversial, of the facts underlying the offences in the Form 1. The first three were committed on 17 April 2007 and concerned supplying 38.2 grams of cocaine, supplying 193.9 grams of methylamphetamine and dealing with $19,350 suspected of being the proceeds of crime. In respect of the first two, W made enquiries of the applicant as to the supply of cocaine and methylamphetamine. On the following day, he went to the applicant's home at Mount Pritchard, paid him $39,600 and was given cocaine and methylamphetamine, which he took away with him. Shortly after, he was arrested and these drugs were found in his possession comprising 34.1 grams of cocaine with a purity of 51 per cent and 193.9 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 33.5 per cent. W was arrested and charged. The third offence concerned the discovery by police later on 17 April 2007 of $19,350 (part of the money earlier paid to him by W to purchase the drugs) in the main bedroom of the applicant's house. (The applicant, who was arrested on 18 April 2007 for these offences, was granted bail on 11 May 2007 and was therefore on bail when he committed the offences to which he pleaded guilty in November 2009.) The fourth offence was committed on 20 August 2007 whilst the applicant was on bail and involved the supply to W of 83.1 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 24 per cent for $11,500. This transaction occurred at the applicant's home. The fifth offence occurred on 28 September 2007 when W met the applicant at his home and paid him $16,500 for the purchase of methylamphetamine. After giving W a sample to test, the applicant told him to go to another address and handed him three plastic bags which contained in all 82.3 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 82.5 per cent. At several previous meetings, W and the applicant had discussed the sale of ice, although this did not ultimately occur. The sixth offence arose from the discovery by police on a search of the applicant's home of $616,658 which was reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of drug sales.

13The Form 1 offences taken into account in the February sentence arose from the discovery by police of $1,312,900 concealed in the roof of his sister's premises on 25 October 2007, $544,550 found in the same premises on 8 April 2008 and, lastly, $2,478,850 found on the same day concealed in premises occupied by the applicant's niece. This money was reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of drug sales but it was not suggested the sales were made by the applicant.

14The applicant had become involved in the commission of the offences in order to obtain funds. Whether the money was for the purpose of financing a debt or paying demands by the outlaw motorcycle gang who had kidnapped his son (this matter is discussed below) was uncertain. The sentencing judge referred to both explanations but did not resolve the issue.

The ground of appeal

15As mentioned above, the sole ground of appeal concerns the way in which the judge applied the standard non-parole period to sentencing the applicant on the second count on the indictment dealt with on 28 May 2010. The other sentences are not appealed from, nor is there any contention that the overall sentence was excessive.

16In respect of the standard non-parole period, the judge said - 

""There is a standard non-parole period of ten years for the second count on the indictment. The standard non-parole period is intended for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness where the offender is found guilty after trial. I note in R v Way [[2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168] the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal as to the approach to be taken when determining whether there are reasons not to impose the standard non-parole period. If the conclusion I reach is that there are reasons not to impose the standard non-parole period, that standard non-parole period remains of relevance as a reference point, benchmark, sounding board or guidepost. I must then exercise my sentencing discretion in accordance with established sentencing practice and by reference to the matters identified in s 3A, 21A, 22, 22A and 23 of the Act.

Here there were pleas of guilty and so the imposition of the standard non-parole period is not obligatory, but even after a plea of guilty there must be an appropriate relationship between the standard non-parole period and the objective criminality of the offences regardless of the other matters that may be taken into account by way of mitigation. When assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, the inquiry must be confined to matters that directly or causally relate to the commission of the offence. This involves an inquiry that would take into account the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct and those facts that might properly affect the mens rea of the offender.""

17The judge then quoted a passage from the judgment of Howie J in R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430 at [24] dealing with the factors relevant to determining whether the offence of supplying a prohibited drug fell within the mid-range of seriousness, referring to the amount and purity of the drug as significant but not decisive matters, the number of occasions involved, the motivation for supply, the extent of planning and the offender's role. Her Honour also referred to R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135 where Wood CJ at CL referred to the centrality of the role of the offender in the assessment of objective seriousness. She then dealt with the prosecution submission that the objective seriousness of the commercial supply fell into the mid-range of objective seriousness and contrasted the submission of counsel for the applicant who submitted that his criminality was well below the mid-range for such an offence. Her Honour then said - 

""I am satisfied the offence is below the middle of the range of objective seriousness, but not appreciably so. I have come to that conclusion because, although this supply was not an isolated incident and the purity of the drug was high, the quantity of the drug supplied is towards the lower end of the commercial range [and] the offender's role, although above the level of a street dealer, is not that of a principal... [or] organiser and the drugs were not actually supplied."" 

The judge then dealt with factors which aggravated the seriousness of the offences, and moved on to the applicant's subjective features. Her Honour then dealt with the Form 1 offences which, in her opinion, required the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the commercial supply to be increased and went on - 

""My finding that the s 25(2) offence is not in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, the plea of guilty and the s 23 considerations [ie, those matters giving rise to an additional discount] mean that there are reasons not to impose the standard non-parole period. I do not propose to do so. 

I indicate that I have had regard to the relevant statutory framework that relates to the sentencing of offences and to the principles established in the authorities which bear upon the issue and I have had regard to the purposes of sentencing which are set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.""

18The judge then considered the statistical information about sentences for the two offences, describing them as having ""some value as a reference point"". Her Honour partially accumulated the sentences and slightly reduced the non-parole period for the commercial supply to take account of the accumulation. There were no other special circumstances justifying an additional adjustment. 

19The sentences which otherwise would have been imposed were reduced by 35 per cent by virtue of the plea of guilty and ""the s 23 factor"". It follows that the starting point for the supply charge was a fixed sentence (ie, equivalent to a non-parole period) of 4 years 2 months (the result after discount being rounded down slightly) and for the commercial supply 11 years 8 months (again with a slight rounding down). Looking at the matter overall - which, to my mind, is the correct approach to avoid qualifying the discount by accumulation and thus ensure that it is actually applied - the starting point was 14 years 2 months which yields, after a 35 per cent discount, slightly over 9 years 2 months. 

20(I note - though this is not the subject of complaint - that the judge did not take into account the imprisonment of the applicant between 18 April 2007 and 10 May 2007 following his being charged with the first three offences listed in the first Form 1.)

Submissions

21It is was submitted by the applicant that the sentencing judge, in accordance with authority then binding on her, emphasised the necessity, even following a plea of guilty, that there be ""an appropriate relationship between the standard non-parole period and the objective criminality of the offences, regardless of the other matters that may be taken into account by way of mitigation"". It is also submitted that a mathematical analysis of the sentence confirmed the dominance of the standard non-parole period in the sentencing exercise. A 35 per cent reduction to the standard non-parole period of 10 years results in a sentence of 6 years 6 months, a year longer than the non-parole period ultimately imposed. That difference, it is submitted, suggests that it reflected her Honour's view as to the objective seriousness of the offence, being somewhat but ""not appreciably"" below the standard non-parole period. 

22The prominence given to the standard non-parole period was, it was submitted, contrary to the principle stated in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [26] to [28]. 

23The Crown's submissions emphasised the importance of considering the sentencing remarks fairly and in their entirety rather than confining attention to a discrete statement which might be suggestive of error. It is submitted that the mere fact that the sentencing judge determined the level of objective seriousness is not an error, nor is the utilisation of the standard non-parole period as a guidepost bearing on the appropriate sentence. 

24So far as the mathematical argument is concerned, it was submitted by the Crown that the aggravating features mentioned by the sentencing judge (discussed below) were of such significance that, had the standard non-parole period dominated the process as contended by the applicant, the non-parole period ultimately imposed must necessarily have been higher. 

Consideration

25In R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, the Court said (at [122]) that, when the standard non-parole period was departed from, it should ""take its place as a reference point ... along with the other extrinsic aids such as authorities, statistics, guideline judgments and the specified maximum penalty, as are applicable and relevant. In particular, it can have a direct relevance as a reference point to be compared with a sentence which is provisionally reached"" after taking into account what might be called the conventional matters, although (at [131]) the Court warned against starting with the standard non-parole period and ""to oscillate about it by reference to the aggravating and mitigating factors, [noting that the] problem with that approach is that the standard non-parole period will tend to dominate the remainder of the exercise..."". (Emphasis added). Accordingly, in Way the standard non-parole period is afforded particular significance. In Muldrock the High Court said (at [25]) that a sentencing court ""is not required when sentencing for a Div 1A offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed with an assessment of whether the offence is within the midrange of objective seriousness"". Furthermore, it ""is a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance"" to the standard non-parole period (at [26]). Nor does the Act permit a two-stage approach to sentencing (at [28]).

26In discussing the applicability of the standard non-parole period in this case the judge referred to Way, in particular, ""as to the approach to be taken when determining whether there are reasons not to impose the standard non-parole period"", imposition of which was not, as her Honour observed, ""obligatory"" because the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence. Her Honour said that it remained relevant ""as a reference point, benchmark, sounding board or guidepost"", going on to refer to exercising the ""sentencing discretion in accordance with established sentencing practice and by reference to the matters identified in ss 3A, 21A, 22, 22A and 23 of the [Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999]"". 

27To my mind, these passages imply that the judge intended to approach the application of the standard non-parole period in the manner criticised in Muldrock, namely by asking whether there were reasons for not imposing it. This approach is not corrected by noting that it was not obligatory to impose the standard non-parole period. Moreover, they show that the standard non-parole period not only dominated the exercise but reflected a two-stage approach. Firstly, her Honour stated that there must be ""an appropriate relationship between the standard non-parole period and the objective criminality of the offences, regardless of the other matters that may be taken into account by way of mitigation"". Then her Honour determined that the offence was below the middle of the range of objective seriousness, which again focused on the standard non-parole period and, in my view, was intended by her Honour to explain why, quite apart from subjective features, it should be departed from. The judge, having formed the view that the standard non-parole period should be departed from, went on to utilise it as central to the assessment of sentence by measuring the extent of objective seriousness by reference to that which attracted the standard non-parole period. It scarcely needs to be said that her Honour's reasons need to be read as a whole. However, there is nothing in those reasons which varies or qualifies the passages to which I have referred.

28I mentioned the Crown submission, in part by way of response to the argument advanced on behalf of the applicant that the sentence itself showed that the standard non-parole period had dominated the measure of the applicant's sentence, that aggravating features identified by the judge would have significantly increased the sentence and thus the standard non-parole period did not play the significant role contended for. The judge found firstly, that each offence was aggravated as the offender was on bail when they were committed and, secondly, ""they were committed for financial reward"". No complaint is made on the applicant's behalf in respect of these findings. 

29I am, with respect, of the view that the second factor identified as aggravating the offences could not properly be so regarded. In Elyard v R [2006] NSWCCA 43, Basten JA discussed the application of s 21A(4) where a characteristic of the offence under consideration was also described as an aggravating factor in s 21A(2), in that case where the sentencing judge had taken into account in a case of aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm as an aggravating factor that it was committed ""without regard for public safety"" (vide para 21A(2)(i)). Basten JA was of the view, in substance, that the creation of the aggravated offence with the accompanying greater maximum penalty indicated that it was based ""upon an assessment [by the legislature] of the circumstances which will generally accompany an offence of that kind, including in this example, lack of regard for public safety"", which was a common, if not invariable, attribute of the offence (ibid at [7] - [9]). His Honour added - 

""[10] To give effect to the underlying purpose [of s 23(4)] of the prohibition, differences in language between the definition of elements of an offence and the statement of aggravating factors, must be borne in mind, as must the purpose underlying the inclusion of a particular element in a particular offence. Such a purposive approach should be applied to the constraint contained in the last sentence of sub-s (2), as a more semantic approach to the language of the various paragraphs may otherwise fail to avoid the risk of ""double-counting"", being the result which is clearly intended. As a matter of principle, it follows that characteristics of an element of an offence should also not be treated as aggravating factors if they merely reflect the policy underlying the offence. There can be no doubt that the inclusion of the circumstances of aggravation identified in s 52A(7) of the Crimes Act are intended to prohibit conduct which may well occur in disregard of public safety, because the conscious creation of a drug-affected state, combined with the act of driving a motor vehicle, will usually satisfy that description. Accordingly, acting without regard for public safety should not, in such a case, be given additional effect as an aggravating factor in its own right, unless the circumstances of the case involve some unusually heinous behaviour, or inebriation above the statutory precondition.

...

[12] It appears from the cases that the factor which has given rise to significant difficulty is par (i) dealing with offences committed ""without regard for public safety"". There has been limited consideration as to whether this factor involves an objective, or subjective test, and if subjective, what level of conscious or reckless disregard is required on the part of the offender. It may well be that this factor should be understood as encompassing both objective and subjective circumstances. However, the distinction can be helpful in order to avoid the danger of double-counting. Where the offence is of a kind which, objectively or abstractly, reflects a policy of prohibiting conduct which disregards public safety, it will be necessary, in order to engage the aggravating factor, to find some aspect of the specific conduct in question which goes beyond the objective element or underlying policy.

...

[17] As discussed above, it is necessary to distinguish cases where a factor identified in sub-s 21A(2) as an aggravating factor is an element of an offence or, in the sense described above, an inherent characteristic or a characteristic that appertains generally to conduct covered by that offence, on the one hand, and other conduct which cannot properly be so described ...""

Howie J (who agreed with Basten JA) said - 

""[40] [By virtue of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act] not only must the sentencing court not take into account as an aggravating feature an element of the offence, it also must not take into account as an aggravating feature an inherent characteristic of the class of offence of which the offence before the court is an example... [This] must be so in order to avoid either real or apparent double counting of aggravating features...""

30There are many examples in the judgments of this Court where Elyard has been followed, to which I do not need to refer. Of particular relevance, however, is Bowden v R [2009] NSWCCA 45 where the sentences under appeal included one of ongoing supply of methylamphetamine. The sentencing judge had found as a circumstance of aggravation under s 21A(2)(o) that the offence was committed for financial gain. Hall J (at [65]) noted that the Crown had ""properly conceded"" error. 

31In substance, the Court must avoid double counting. This is a self- evident matter of fundamental principle for which no authority needs be cited. One way of doing this is to apply, in terms, s 21A(2) by disregarding a listed aggravating factor ""if it is an element of the offence"". The reason for this is, as Basten JA explained in Elyard in the above-quoted passage, that the matter has already been factored in by the legislature in setting the maximum penalty as a marker of the seriousness of the offence. The same reasoning applies to any commonly present factors relevant to seriousness ""if they merely reflect the policy underlying the offence"" or ""generally accompany"" the offence; they need not be present in every case. Considered in this way, this is no more than to take into consideration the matters to which the creation of the offence is directed. 

32I should refer to Couloumbis v R [2012] NSWCCA 264, which involved the offence of conspiracy to commit aggravated armed robbery, where the question arose whether the fact that the motive was financial gain was an additional aggravating feature in terms of s 21A(2)(o) of the Act. Harrison J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Adamson J agreed) said, after referring to the phrase ""inherent characteristic"" used by Howie J in Elyard - 

""[31] An inherent characteristic suggests something that is always present as a permanent and essential attribute of the thing under consideration. As counsel for the applicant quite properly conceded in this Court, examples of the subject offence in which financial gain was wholly absent could readily be identified. It follows that financial gain is no more an inherent characteristic of the offence than it is an element of the offence.""

In my respectful view, this passage is to be read as meaning, in effect, that the presence of financial gain in the context of aggravated robbery was not so common as to lead to the conclusion that it was a consideration in setting the maximum penalty as a marker of seriousness. As explained above, it is sufficient if the particular matter falls within the policy underlying the creation of the offence and the prescribed penalty.

33Cases of the commercial supply of a drug which do not involve the factor of monetary gain are extremely rare though one can imagine (with some difficulty) cases where the motive is otherwise. It seems plain that the penalty for the offence is in large part set with reference to the criminality of the trafficking in the drug for financial gain. The evident purpose of the legislation is to deter the commercial trading in drugs; and the fact that the level of punishment is measured by the amount of drugs involved does not in any way qualify this point. The description of the quantity as ""commercial"" is an obvious demonstration of this point. Moreover, in this case, the judge implicitly had regard to the motive of financial gain when assessing objective seriousness in her Honour's description of the nature of the applicant's dealing and, thus, to treat it as an aggravating feature was to double count. Although the offences of supply are not described as involving ""commercial"" quantities, it seems to me that deterring the supply of the specified quantities for profit is very much part of the legislative policy underlying the offence and, accordingly, that they were undertaken for financial gain is not an additional aggravating factor. In respect of the cash, there was no evidence of any particular motive and the seriousness of those offences can be considered without reference to financial gain: keeping safe the substantial proceeds of serious crime - a form of concealing evidence as well as necessarily encouraging the commission of drug supply offences - is a sufficient description of the gist of the offence. 

34At all events, given the nature of the ""aggravating"" circumstances, I think they would have been unlikely to have significantly increased the non-parole period her Honour was minded to impose. It is also submitted that this argument was otiose by virtue of the February sentence. Since that second sentence in no way affected the first set of sentences, this argument must be rejected. 

35Although each case must necessarily depend on its own facts, I note that the reasoning adopted by the sentencing judge in Bolt v R [2012] NSWCCA 50, which resulted in a successful appeal on this ground was similar to that used in the present case. As McCallum J observed (ibid at [32]), since, at the time of this sentence, the sentencing judge (rightly) considered herself to be bound by Way, it would not be surprising if principles disapproved in Muldrock had been applied. It follows that, subject to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the sentence should be quashed and a lesser sentence imposed.

Sentence for the offence under appeal

36Although I would readily accept that the sentence here impugned is within the discretionary range, it is nevertheless necessary that this Court consider for itself the appropriate sentence to impose. In Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 (where the sentencing judge had misstated the maximum sentence), Spigelman CJ explained the correct approach once error had been identified - 

""[10] When the Court of Criminal Appeal turns its mind to forming the opinion which s6(3) requires, it must do so by reference to the facts as they exist at that time, insofar as the Court permits evidence of those facts to be placed before the Court.

[11] The construction for which the Crown contends in this respect [that the Court should not consider fresh evidence tendered on the appeal when considering whether to re-sentence] does receive support from the approach to s6(3) in the judgment of this Court in R v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186. Hunt AJA concluded at [33]-[34] that the words in s6(3) ""is warranted in law"" require the Court to determine whether the sentence that had actually been imposed is ""outside the appropriate range for the circumstances of the particular case"". 

[12] It has been suggested that the substantive effect of this reasoning would be, if correct, that this Court would, even if it found error in some other respect, only intervene if it was also of the view that the sentence was manifestly excessive. It does not appear to me that his Honour intended such a consequence. His Honour expressly stated at [29]:

""The applicant argued that, according to the Simpson case [R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704; 126 A Crim R 525], this Court would not intervene unless it formed the view that the sentence imposed was 'manifestly excessive'. That is not the correct approach."" 

[13] In contrast pars [33]-[34] of Johnson appear to be inconsistent with the practice of courts of criminal appeal when re-exercising the sentencing discretion pursuant to the provisions such as s6(3). Specifically, they appear to be inconsistent with the reasoning of the High Court in Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 and of this Court in Simpson.

[14] In Dinsdale the High Court was concerned with the terminology of the equivalent provision in Western Australia to s6(3). The judgments indicated that a court of criminal appeal is concerned with the full range of error of the character which, in Australian jurisprudence, is generally associated with the judgment in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. (See at [3] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J, at [21] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ and at [58] per Kirby J.) It is clear from the reasoning that an error identified in terms of a sentence being ""manifestly excessive"" is only one kind of error that satisfies the provisions of s6(3). (See at [6], [22] and [59]-[60].) Dinsdale affirmed that a Court of Criminal Appeal must re-exercise the sentencing discretion. 

[15] Further, as the very next paragraph of Simpson, to that upon which the Crown relies, stated: 

""[80] In the present case I do not believe there is any proper basis for the formation of an opinion in the statutory terms; the objective and subjective circumstances do not lead me to the conclusion that 'some other sentence ... is warranted in law and should have been passed'."" [Emphasis added.]

Plainly this is a reference to the full range of matters that inform the sentencing discretion. 

[16] The statement in Johnson that s6(3) requires the Court to determine whether the sentence is ""outside the appropriate range"" should not be regarded as a pre-condition to the formation of the opinion for which s6(3) provides.

[17] The words ""warranted in law"" in s6(3) do not refer only to the situation in which a sentence actually passed was outside the permissible range. That would focus attention only on the time of the original sentence and the reasoning process of the sentencing judge. For the reasons I have identified above, the dual reference to the present tense reinforces the express reference to the ""opinion"" of the Court of Criminal Appeal to emphasise that it is the appellate court that is making a judgment as to whether or not the sentence actually passed was ""warranted in law"". The subsection is not directed to answering the question as to whether or not the particular sentence was warranted in law from the perspective of the original sentencing judge alone. 

[18] In these circumstances the phrase ""warranted in law"" should be understood as a reference to the entire body of legal rules that inform the exercise of a sentencing discretion, i.e. both statutory requirements and sentencing principles developed at common law. 

[19] The import of par [79] of Simpson was to ensure that submissions in the Court of Criminal Appeal did not proceed as if the identification of error created an entitlement on the part of an Applicant to a new sentence, for example, by merely adjusting the sentence actually passed to allow for the error identified. That would be to proceed on the assumption that the sentencing judge was presumptively correct, when the Court has determined that the exercise of the discretion had miscarried. Section 6(3) is directed to ensuring that the Court of Criminal Appeal does not proceed in that manner, but re-exercises the sentencing discretion taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which the subsection provides."" 

37 Latham J, who agreed with the Chief Justice, added - 

""[83] An error is a ""material error"" if it has the capacity to infect the exercise of the sentencing discretion, regardless of whether it can be demonstrated that the error has in fact influenced the sentencing outcome. It is an error in the House v The King sense because the sentencing judge has taken into account an erroneous or irrelevant consideration. However, the error must be more than ""trivial or immaterial"": R v Jeremy Paul Price [2005] NSWCCA 285 at [56] ; see also Phillip Edward Smith v R [2007] NSWCCA 138 at [30] to [34]. 

[84] There may be errors in the sentencing process that are of such a technical nature that the error could not have affected the sentencing discretion, for example, where the error relates solely to an individual sentence which is wholly subsumed by sentences imposed for a number of offences: Regina v Tadrosse (2005) 65 NSWLR 740 ; [2005] NSWCCA 145 at [30]. Similarly, where an incorrect maximum penalty is applied in respect of only one offence among many offences carrying significantly higher maximum penalties, it is unlikely that such an error could be regarded as material. 

[85] It is only where the error can be seen to be material that s 6(3) is enlivened and the evidence of post-sentence conduct, if any, falls to be considered by this Court in determining whether some lesser sentence is warranted in law. In R v Burke [2002] NSWCCA 353, Sperling J (with whom Giles JA and Levine J agreed) set out his understanding of s6(3), consistent with this approach (at [83] - [86]):-

""Where the sentence is not manifestly excessive, the appellate court must quash the sentence and re-sentence the offender if - and only if - (a) the sentence imposed below is vitiated by error, and (b) the sentence is more severe than the appellate court would have imposed and, necessarily, would now impose on re-sentencing the offender.
... 

However, ... some refinement is necessary. For example, if there were error in the sentencing process below which cannot have made any material difference to the result, the appellate court would not intervene, even if it would have imposed a less severe sentence were it re-sentencing the appellant.""

This aspect of Burke was cited with approval in Douar [(2005) 159 A Crim R 154] by Johnson J at [123].

[86] Of course, the materiality of the error says nothing about whether the error has in fact operated upon the sentencing discretion..."" 

38It has not been submitted here by the Crown that, if the Muldrock error was established, it was not material. Accordingly, I now move to the sentence appropriate to impose on the applicant. 

Subjective features

39The objective facts have been set out above. There was no dispute about the subjective features although their significance was not agreed. In this Court the parties did not contend that the sentencing judge's findings about this matter were wrong. The following is drawn from her Honour's remarks on sentence (again with quotation marks omitted). 

40The applicant was 52 years of age when he was sentenced, living with his wife and three children aged between nine and 23 years. Since his incarceration on 25 July 2007 he received regular visits from his family, whom he described as his ""pride and joy"". 

41The applicant was self-employed as a tradesperson between 1975 and 2000, then buying and managing an equestrian centre on the fringes of Sydney, which he sold in 2006 and later starting a successful business of manufacturing and selling compression guns. He intends to return to this business when he is released. The applicant reported that he commenced using illicit substances in about 1994 on what he described as a social basis, involving the use of 0.2 or 0.3 grams of cocaine and amphetamine three or four times a year. He smoked small amounts of cannabis about once a week. He did not consider this use to be a problem and has never sought any intervention for it. 

42In 2006 the applicant's son was kidnapped by members of an outlaw motorcycle gang and held hostage for some 18 hours before being returned to the family without suffering physical harm. Those responsible have been dealt with. Since that time, however, the applicant has received continual harassment and threats, which he attributes to associates of those convicted of the kidnapping of his son and, as a consequence, he fears for his family's welfare. The applicant's wife reported that, since the kidnapping, the applicant's behaviour changed. He became more edgy and anxious. In her view he feels helpless because he cannot protect his family from intimidation. 

43It appears that the sentencing judge accepted the opinion of the author of the pre-sentence report that the applicant did not appear to take full responsibility for his involvement in the offences, preferring rather to blame to the individual to whom he had buckled and agreed to source the drugs for and the police, stating it was a kind of entrapment. That author considered that the applicant appeared to display little insight into the impact of his offences on the wider community. 

44So far as the applicant's imprisonment is concerned, in early December 2007 he was placed on protection at the direction of the correctional officers following information that suggested his safety might be in jeopardy, although he indicated he did not require protection. After two months it was thought that the threat was no longer of imminent concern and the non-association order was terminated. 

45The sentencing judge referred to the facts that the applicant's mother, who suffers from dementia, is in a nursing home and one of his sisters needs a lung transplant, whilst his other sister has cancer. (By the time of the February sentence, sadly, his mother and a sister had died.) The judge accepted that the applicant's inability to provide support for his family made his custody more difficult for him. Her Honour quoted, (and I think accepted) the conclusion of the pre-sentence report - 

""[The applicant] is a 52 year old man, who initially presented as difficult to engage and somewhat reluctant toward involvement in the preparations for this report, however during the second interview appeared to relax somewhat and was more open. On the whole it is considered that whilst he would answer most questions posed, he appeared to only be willing to provide the barest minimum of information.

The offender has the benefit of a stable and supportive family environment, however it is noted that following the kidnapping of his son several years ago, the stability of this environment appears to have deteriorated somewhat... [The applicant] and his wife have both confirmed that this event had a significant impact on the entire family, in particular the offender and the ongoing threat to his family's safety by way of threats and intimidation would appear to have been a destabilising factor in his life since that time.

It is of concern that... [the applicant] appeared to take little responsibility for his offending behaviour and displayed no insight into the effects of his crime on those other than himself.""

46So far as is relevant, the applicant was convicted on 7 July 1983 in what was then the Court of Petty Sessions of an offence of supplying heroin, in respect of which sentence was deferred on a recognisance to be of good behaviour for 3 years, on 26 March 1984 he was convicted in the District Court of supplying heroin and was imprisoned for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and, lastly, on 24 February 1988 the applicant was convicted in the Local Court of possessing a prohibited drug and fined $400. 

47The pleas of guilty were entered after the matter had been set down for trial three times but her Honour allowed a discount on the ground that the expense of a four to six weeks trial was avoided. Of considerable importance was a report which enlivened the application of s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the contents of which, together with the plea of guilty, resulted in a reduction in the sentences that otherwise would have been imposed by 35 per cent. It is not submitted by either party that this discount was inappropriate. As I have already mentioned, apart from special circumstances resulting from the partial accumulation of the sentences, it was not submitted that there were other matters which should lead to the additional adjustment of the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term.

Objective seriousness

48I have mentioned above how, following Muldrock, the standard non-parole period is not to be used. How should it be used?

49In R v Biddle [2011] NSWSC 1262, Garling J summarised the effect of Muldrock in the following way - 

""[23] In considering the imposition of a sentence under s 54B, the following considerations are appropriate:

(a) The effect of s 54B(2), despite its apparently mandatory terms, is to preserve the full scope of judicial discretion to impose a non-parole period longer or shorter than a standard non-parole period: Muldrock at [25];

(b) When read with s 21A, s 54B requires an approach to sentencing which is consistent with the judgment of McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]: Muldrock at [26];

(c) In considering all factors relevant to sentencing the Court must keep in mind the two legislative guideposts: the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period: Muldrock at [27];

(d) In giving content in a specific case to the statutory phrase ""... an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness ..."", the assessment is made without reference to matters personal to an offender or class of offenders, and is made by reference wholly to the nature of the offending: Muldrock at [27]; 

(e) The standard non-parole period is not the starting point in sentencing for a mid-range offence after conviction: Muldrock at [31], nor does it have determinative significance in sentencing an offender: Muldrock at [32]."" 

50Taking up the point made at sub-para (d) (referencing Muldrock at [27]), what is the ""nature of the offending"" that gives content to the standard non-parole period signpost? The referenced passage might mean the offending conduct in the particular case or, on the other hand, the offending implied by the legal character of the offence. In Muldrock at [31] the Court noted, ""The standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case"" (Emphasis added). This appears to be a statement of the effect of s 54B(3), which provides that the standard non-parole period can only be departed from for the reasons specified in s 21A whilst that section lists - together with the catch-all in s 21A(1)(c) - every matter capable of being relevant to sentence. Since those matters provide the very grounds for departing from the standard non-parole period, it does not make sense that they can also be the matters taken into account to decide whether in the first place the offence is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. (The possible solution to this circularity by allowing departure only by reference to the subjective matters listed in s 21A requires limiting the general language of s 54B in a manner that is significantly at odds with its natural meaning.) Since it is impossible to evaluate the objective seriousness of particular offending without taking into account all the circumstances of its commission, the objective circumstances that bring an offence into the middle of the range must necessarily remain, as it were, skeletal and, in the nature of the case, hypothetical since every offence is committed in particular circumstances. It seems to me, with respect, that the High Court has now made it clear that the notion of the middle of the range of objective seriousness does not concern the facts in a particular case nor any facts other than the bare characteristics of the offence, given that it is not permissible to hypothesise circumstances against which to compare the particular case. 

51It seems to me, with respect, that it follows from Muldrock that the standard non-parole period is a marker, together with the maximum sentence, of the gravity of an offence of the kind under consideration but it is not a measure of the appropriate punishment in the particular case or a number in the calculation of that sentence. Its significance in a particular case as a marker will vary. In a case such as Muldrock's the standard non-parole period of 15 years ""[said] little about the appropriate sentence for this mentally retarded offender and this offence"" (Muldrock at [32]). In other cases, its significance might well be greater. 

52Assessment of the particular seriousness of an offence is obviously an essential part of the sentencing process. The facts of the matter themselves will, and certainly should, demonstrate both the seriousness of the particular offence and the culpability of the offender. Sometimes it is useful, and it is certainly conventional, to describe a level of seriousness, but s 54B(4) does not suggest a need either ""to attribute particular mathematical values to matters regarded as significant"" or ""classify the objective seriousness of the offending"": Muldrock (at [29]). Perhaps the description ""middle of the range of objective seriousness"", might be, for all its obscurity, informative in some cases, but if a two-stage process is to be avoided, it should not in my opinion be regarded as yielding a sentence or even range of sentences. Such a classification is likely to confuse the objective seriousness of the particular case with what might be called the-standard-non-parole-period-marker and potentially give it the dominant significance which was disapproved in Muldrock and, indeed (to some extent) in Way.

53To the above discussion, I would respectfully add the remarks of Basten JA (with whom Johnson J and I agreed) in R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288 - 

""[15] The introduction, in 2002, of standard non-parole periods in relation to some offences raised a question as to the extent to which the principles underpinning s 21A were being varied: Sentencing Procedure Act, Part 4, Div 1A. There was no doubt that, as this Court held in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [50] affirmed by the High Court in Muldrock at [27], there were now two legislative guideposts for some offences, namely the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period. In Way, the Court went further, noting that s 54B(2) was ""framed in mandatory terms"" so that, absent identification of reasons for ordering otherwise, it identified the period to be prescribed. Because the power of engagement was identified by reference to the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence, the effect of a mandatory provision would either be to devalue the other considerations prescribed by s 21A, or to prescribe the adoption of a two-stage procedure or, arguably, both. To the extent that Way upheld those approaches, its conclusions were rejected in Muldrock... at [25] and [28].

...

[17] So understood, the standard non-parole period provisions operated... [to prescribe, inter alia, the range of available penalties and the determination of relevant, permissible and irrelevant considerations]; by identifying, where applicable, another factor (or guidepost) to be taken into account. They did not operate... [to impose] a procedural constraint on the process. Other provisions ... [required] the Court to identify in its reasons the facts, matters and circumstances by which the non-parole period imposed varied from the standard non-parole period: s 54B(4); Muldrock at [29]. The Court emphasised that this exercise did not require the ascription of mathematical values to various elements, nor the need to ""classify"" the objective seriousness of the offending. Muldrock affirmed (at [26]) that the broad ranging and flexible inquiry envisaged by s 21A and confirmed in Markarian [Makarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 378] was not subjected to a procedural straitjacket in respect of particular offences by the introduction of Div 1A into Part 4. 

[18] Perhaps because this Court in Way took the view that, where applicable and absent reason for departure, the standard non-parole period should be applied, it permitted a broad range of factors to be considered in determining the ""objective seriousness"" of the offence: at [84]-[86], Muldrock weakens the link between the standard non-parole period and the sentence imposed in a particular case and limits the range of such factors: at [27].

[19] What remains in doubt, however, is whether the sentencing court is required or permitted to classify, or prohibited from classifying, the particular offence by reference to a low, middle or high range of objective seriousness. The statements at [25] and [29] indicate that the sentencing judge is not required to undertake such an assessment or classification. The statement at [28] indicates that it would be wrong to adopt a two-stage approach which commenced with such an assessment and then sought reasons for departure. On the other hand, to treat the standard non-parole period as a guidepost requires that the phrase ""the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" must be given content: see [27]. Further, the Court recognised the need for a sentencing judge to maintain ""awareness"" of the standard non-parole period as an additional consideration bearing on the appropriate sentence: at [31]. That exercise must include reference to the statutory context for its consideration. Nor did the Court suggest that a conventional assessment of the objective offending, according to a scale of seriousness, was to be eschewed. The diminished role accorded the standard non-parole period is, in effect, a function of the fact that it involves an hypothetical offence, ascertained by reference to a limited range of considerations. In Carlton v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 244; 189 A Crim R 332 at [90], I noted that, whilst s 54A refers to ""the range"" of objective seriousness:

""The statutory language does not require the determination of a low range, a middle range and a high range of seriousness: it envisages a single range and an offence in the middle of the range... As a practical matter, it must be accepted that the middle of a range of seriousness is not a precise point, nor is there any paradigm by which it can be identified. This follows almost inevitably from the scope and variety of circumstances which can be relevant to considering seriousness."" 

[20] Further, I suggested at [88] in Carlton that while the standard non-parole period is said to ""represent"" the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, the term ""represents"" is a curious one:

""Section 54A(2) does not say that the standard non-parole period is that which 'should be' set for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. That the legislature eschewed such language may reflect the fact that a non-parole period is not determined solely by reference to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence; the exercise also takes into account subjective factors specific to the offender, but not relevant to the seriousness of the offence."" 

[21] These comments do not appear to be inconsistent with the remarks in Muldrock . One consequence of Muldrock is that a sentencing judge will need to bear the standard non-parole period in mind as a marker, whether or not there are reasons why it should not be applied. One reason for non-application is a plea of guilty entitling the offender to a discount, although that is not a factor relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence, in the terms identified in Muldrock. More importantly, the standard non-parole period cannot have ""determinative significance"" - see Muldrock at [32] - nor even, as the Court also noted, much weight at all in circumstances such as those which arose in Muldrock itself.""

54The most significant aspects in the assessment of objective seriousness are, of course, the quantity and purity of the drugs involved, the role of the offender and the degree of planning. It is clear also that this was not an isolated transaction but part of a system of trafficking in prohibited and dangerous drugs. Society must be protected from those who undertake the breaking of the law for profit, reflecting on the need both for general and personal deterrence. 

55With respect, I agree with the sentencing judge's conclusions that the applicant, although above the level of street dealer, was not a principal or organiser. The quantity of drugs was just over the lower end of the commercial range (250g to less than 1kg) but it was of relatively high purity. So far as the offences on the Form 1 are concerned, that of dealing with the sum of $19,350 is of no real significance, for the reasons I have already mentioned; the other dealing, involving over $616,000 is not at all trivial. This offence, prescribed by s 193C of the Crimes Act 1900, attracts a maximum penalty of 50 penalty points and/or imprisonment for 2 years. It is by no means as serious as the offence of commercially supplying drugs. Nor can it be inferred that the money was the proceeds of drug supply, though of course this must be the inevitable suspicion. So far as the other drug offences are concerned, the cocaine was supplied to W on the same occasion as the methylamphetamine which were the subject of the supply count whilst the other methylamphetamine supplies occurred in the two months preceding his arrest. Taken together with the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine discovered by police in the applicant's house (being the substantive offence) and the agreed facts as to prior negotiations and meetings between the applicant and W which did not result in supplying drugs, the Form 1 offences show that the applicant had been in the business of supplying prohibited drugs for some time. The commission of the offence whilst on bail is a significant aggravating factor (s 21A(2)(j)) and that three of the Form 1 offences were committed whilst on bail is an indication of the applicant's attitude to breaking the law. Also, the Form 1 offences - except I think those that concern the cocaine and the smaller proceeds offence - add to the criminality of the substantive offence and should result in some increase in the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate.

56As to the applicant's subjective features, the following additional matters should be noted. The pleas of guilty and the s 23 matter are some evidence of contrition and remorse, though the former largely reflected, I think, acceptance of the inevitable. The fact that the applicant regrets the effect of his actions on his family and does not, as appears from the pre-sentence report, entirely accept his responsibility for his offences does not mean to my mind that it should not be concluded that he will not seek to avoid committing further offences in the future. The very lengthy crime free period (except for one minor offence) of about 20 years following his release from prison in 1983 to his commission of the present offences is to my mind significant and I would give some weight to the disturbing effects of his son's kidnapping as a contribution to the resumption of his criminal conduct. I am of the view that the applicant has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.

57Bearing in mind the gravity of the offence, marked by the maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years for a case in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, I would propose a commencement point for the commercial supply charge of 10 years imprisonment. Applying the 35 per cent discount would result in a term of 6 years and 6 months. In respect of the non-parole period, there are no relevant special circumstances that would justify an adjustment of the ratio stipulated in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, except for the adjustment made necessary by its accumulation on the fixed term imposed for the supply offence. Accordingly, I would impose a non-parole period of 4 years and 4 months commencing 1 July 2008, less a reduction of 1 month to account for the period of custody before bail was granted, resulting in a term of 4 years and 3 months. 

58It is necessary to consider, under s 23(3) of the Act, whether the sentence is ""unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence"". No doubt, it is disproportionate but I do not think it is unreasonably so and would not propose an adjustment for this reason. 

59The February sentence was ordered, in effect, to commence at the expiration of the non-parole period imposed for the commercial supply offence. That specified date must be altered to effect this outcome. Accordingly, that should be varied to commence on 1 November 2012.

Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912

60It follows from the above that, in terms of the sub-section, I am of the opinion that a less severe sentence ""is warranted in law and should have been passed"", this being so although, as I have mentioned, the sentence under appeal is certainly within the discretionary range. It will be seen that I formed this view on the basis of the criminality of the commercial supply offence. It was not submitted by the Crown that, considered alone, there was no basis upon which the sentence could be reduced. It is, however, submitted by the Crown that it is necessary to consider the overall sentence for all the offences for which the applicant is now imprisoned when dealing with the requirement of s 6(3) and that, when the offences for which the February sentence was imposed are taken into account, no lesser overall sentence would sufficiently reflect the applicant's overall criminality. It is accordingly submitted that this Court would not interfere with the sentence under appeal even if a lesser sentence for that offence were warranted. 

61As has been mentioned, the February sentence was imposed for an offence under s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act of dealing with the proceeds of crime between 24 October 2007 and 9 April 2008 in the amount of $1,116,980, knowing that this sum was the proceeds of crime. An application for leave to appeal in respect of this sentence was filed on 21 September 2012 but this was not pressed. The Crown accepted that the application for leave to appeal against sentence was confined to the sentence imposed on 28 May 2010 for the commercial supply of methylamphetamine. 

62There is no doubt that the sentence of February 2012 was significantly adjusted by virtue of the term which was imposed on the applicant in May 2010. Her Honour noted that the offence for which the later sentence was imposed was committed as part of a course of conduct engaged in by the applicant prior to his arrest on 25 October 2007 as ""for which he has, for the most part, been sentenced"". (With respect, this is not quite accurate. The possession of property dealt with on the earlier occasion was charged under s 193C of the Crimes Act as the suspected proceeds of crime and thus subject to the far lower maximum sentence of two years, whilst the offences considered in the February sentence were brought under s 193B(2), which involved knowledge that the property was the proceeds of crime and thus attracted a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.) The offence on the indictment concerned $1,116,980, together with the further three similar offences committed at about the same time (reflecting the dates of discovery by police of differing amounts at three different locations) involved an additional $4,336,300. The February sentence was 3 years imprisonment commencing on 2 December 2013 with a 6 months non-parole period. The effect of this sentence was to add 6 months to the non-parole period that the applicant would otherwise serve and 11 months to his overall term. The non-parole period was set in light of the special circumstances found by the sentencing judge arising both from the partial accumulation with the earlier sentences and the applicant's need for a substantial period on parole to support his efforts at rehabilitation. It is clear that the sentence was substantially adjusted by virtue of the totality rule.

63The Crown submits that the criminality involved in the three offences in the two indictments, together with those taken into account, is such that no lesser sentence is warranted and, accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed in accordance with s 6(3). Counsel for the applicant did not, in terms, take issue with the Crown's contention as to the materiality of the February sentence. However, the matter is not without difficulty and requires attention to be paid to the relevant legislative provisions. 

64The starting point, of course, for considering what the Court should do in the event of error being demonstrated in connection with a sentence is s 6(3) which, for convenience I quote - 

""On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.""

The issue is whether the sub-section should be read to enable sentences other than that under appeal to be considered, they having been imposed to reflect the total criminality of which the offence applicable to the sentence under appeal is a part, in other words, whether the phrase ""some other sentence"" referred to the particular sentence under appeal or the overall sentence imposed. 

65In R v Georgiou [2005] NSWCCA 237 the Court considered an appeal against a number of sentences on the ground, in each case, that they were manifestly excessive and, secondly, gave rise to a justifiable sense of grievance when compared with the sentences passed on a co-offender. The Court agreed that the sentencing judge had not complied with the requirements of Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 requiring the fixing of an appropriate sentence for each offence and then considering questions of accumulation or concurrence. So far as three of the sentences which were entirely concurrent, Hulme J concluded that, in respect of the offence for which the longer sentence was imposed, no other sentence less severe was warranted whilst, in respect of the other two charges, those sentences should have been less but, because they involved additional criminality, there should have been at least some accumulation of these sentences with the other sentence. His Honour formed the same view as to the second set of sentences where, again, wholly concurrent sentences were passed. Accordingly, as his Honour said there was ""no error unfavourable to the appellant"". Having rejected the parity argument, his Honour proposed granting leave to appeal and the dismissal of it. Hidden J, in agreeing with this outcome, and with the conclusion that the sentencing judge fell into the error identified in Pearce, found it unnecessary to consider what might have been the appropriate sentence for each offence, viewed in isolation since the global sentence could not be said to be manifestly excessive and that, if it had resulted from what would otherwise have required a partial accumulation, ""the applicant would have had no legitimate complaint"". His Honour added - 

""[65] Generally speaking, in cases such as this no purpose would be served by recasting the sentences for particular offences when the global sentence is an appropriate measure of the overall criminality. For the purposes of s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, the focus should be upon that global sentence and, unless it is more severe than is warranted in law, this Court normally should not intervene at all. I would hesitate to say that intervention would never be called for in this situation but, in my view, this is not such a case.""

If I may say so respectfully, Hidden J's additional comment should be understood in the context of the particular circumstances of the case. 

66In R v Bottin [2005] NSWCCA 254 the applicant had been sentenced for four offences but appealed only in respect of the overall sentence imposed, conceding that the individual sentences did not demonstrate and were not the result of error. Accordingly, the question was whether the ultimate sentence reflected the criminality demonstrated by all the offences or was excessive. Dealing with this question, Studdert J (with whom Kirby and Howie JJ agreed), stated - 

""[37] Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act is to be read, where appropriate, in conjunction with s 7(1A) of that Act. There is a need to consider the total criminality of the appellant, and when this is done, it seems to me that the overall effect of the sentences passed, namely a non parole period of seven years and an available parole period of four years, affords appropriate punishment for the offences committed. In my opinion, punishment no less than that was warranted, and I would therefore not be disposed to interfere with the sentences as structured: see R v Carr [2002] 135 A Crim R 171 at para 35 and R v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253 at para 20.""

Given the nature of the appeal, this statement of principle is scarcely controversial. Technically, an appeal which is confined to the extent of accumulation involves appeals against the starting dates of particular sentences. That, of course, requires attention to be directed to the issue of overall criminality. No adjustment is sought or need be made to the constituent sentences. The question whether, if one sentence is affected by error, it should be varied by reference to the overall sentence therefore does not arise. (I discuss this case because later reliance is placed on it in the context of the present problem.) 

67Bottin was followed a few months later by R v Smith [2005] NSWCCA 339 where, again, the applicant was sentenced for three offences. He raised two grounds of appeal, firstly that the sentence in respect of one of the offences was manifestly excessive and, secondly, that when sentencing the applicant for that sentence, the sentencing judge erred in the extent of its accumulation on the other offences. There was no appeal against the sentences imposed in respect of the other charges. Hulme J said - 

""[37] Having reflected on the matter, I regret to say that I am unable to agree with the view expressed in R v Bottin as to the operation of s6(3). To my mind ""sentence"" in that sub-section refers to the order made or sentence imposed in respect of one offence and not to the overall effect of a combination of sentences. This seems to me to follow from a number of factors. I mention but a few. 

[38] Firstly, the Crimes Act and other offence creating statutes impose penalties by reference to the commission of one offence. Arguing in the same direction is the fact that that no court imposes one sentence for a number of offences. Nor does this Court, when it interferes with the conviction or sentence relating to one of a number of offences and consequent sentences quash or vary the overall result of those sentences. Rather do the Court's orders relate to the one, leaving the other sentences undisturbed (or possibly undisturbed except as to their commencement date(s)). Thirdly, s7(1A) itself is predicated on there being, when an offender is sentenced for more than one offence, more than one sentence.""

Hidden J, however, said - 

""[52] However, while I appreciate the force of his Honour's observations about the passage from Bottin which he has quoted, I consider that the approach expressed in that passage is generally appropriate. I have expressed the same view: see, for example, R v Georgiou [2005] NSWCCA 237 at [65]. The issue normally arises in cases involving two or more offences of a like nature, or offences that are related in such a way as to be seen as part of a continuing criminal enterprise. This is not to say that the Bottin approach is necessarily confined to cases of that kind. 

[53] That said, there will be cases in which that approach should not be adopted. This, in my view, is one of them. Although linked in time, the three offences were of a different nature and were unrelated. The supply of the drug, in particular, was an entirely discrete offence, and a manifestly excessive sentence in respect of it could not be allowed to stand simply on the basis that the overall sentence was a fair reflection of the criminality of all three offences.""

Bell J preferred not to express a view on the correctness of the approach that found favour in Bottin. 

68In Marinellis v R [2006] NSWCCA 307 I said - 

""[66] It has been the frequent practice of this Court to regard s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 as requiring dismissal of an appeal where the overall sentence of a group of sentences is such that no less severe aggregate sentence is warranted in law, even though one or more of the individual sentences included in the group are manifestly excessive: see, for example, McCabe [2006] NSWCCA 220; Georgiou [2005] NSWCCA 237 (per Hidden J); Nightingale [2005] NSWCCA 147 and MM [2002] NSWCCA 431. The notion of an overall or aggregate sentence is useful for discussion, but it to my mind it has no warrant as a legal entity and I respectfully doubt that the word ""sentence"" in s 6(3) can be interpreted to encompass such a meaning. The insertion of the ameliorating provisions of s 7(1A) and the principles authoritatively enunciated in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 reinforce that doubt. However, this matter was not the subject of argument before us and, in the circumstances, I propose to follow the practice to which I have referred.""

McColl JA (with whom Latham J agreed) found it unnecessary to consider the question but added the following - 

""[13] ... I would merely observe having regard to Justice Adams' remarks on that issue that s 7(1A) was not inserted in the Criminal Appeal Act to deal with any perceived deficiency of s 6(3) in a case, such as the present, where the applicant appeals all sentences imposed upon him or her. It came about to address the issue which arose in R v Itamua [2000] NSWCCA 502 where, (at [54] - [55]) Smart AJ (with whom Sheller JA agreed, and Dowd J relevantly agreed) observed that s 6(3) did not empower this Court ""to intervene in respect of sentences in respect of which no appeal is brought by either the appellant or the Crown"", a situation his Honour described as anomalous and calling for remedial legislation. This cri de coeur was accommodated by the insertion of s 7(1A): see Criminal Legislation Amendment Bill, Second Reading Speech, New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Debates, (Hansard) 30 November 2001, vol 289 at 19301."" 

69The question arose more directly in Arnaout v R [2008] NSWCCA 278; (2008) 191 A Crim R 149 where the applicant was sentenced for seven separate offences, with two further charges on a Form 1 taken into account, and sought leave to appeal in respect of all sentences on three grounds: first, that the sentencing judge had given inadequate significance to early pleas of guilty; secondly, that the overall sentence and effective non-parole period were excessive having regard to the criminality demonstrated by the offences; and, thirdly, with respect to an offence of escaping from lawful custody, the sentence was excessive. The Court agreed that this last ground was made out. It was therefore necessary to consider whether the Court should intervene and, if so, to what effect. It was contended on behalf of the Crown that, despite the error, the Court should not intervene, submitting that reducing the sentence in respect of which error had been demonstrated would have resulted in an aggregate sentence less than that which should have been passed. Basten JA said (after quoting the above passage from my judgment in Marinellis -

""[17] The reference to s 7(1A) was not in order to invoke its operation, but by way of assistance in understanding s 6(3).""

His Honour then set out s 7(1A) and the observation of McColl JA quoted above and continued - 

""[19] As a matter of legislative history... [this observation may be correct]; but the reference by Adams J, though elliptical, was by way of confirmation for the conclusion that ""sentence"" in s 6(3) identified a specific sentence in relation to a particular offence and not an overall aggregation of sentences, a construction which obtains support from the separate identification in s 7(1A) of each sentence for any other offence. It is not necessary to rely upon s 7(1A), inserted in 2001, to interpret longstanding provisions of the Act; rather s 7(1A) reveals a further application of the meaning of ""sentence"" as defined in s 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act which, relevantly, includes ""any sentence of imprisonment... imposed under Part 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999"". That in turn picks up the definition of ""sentence"" in s 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, set out at [9] above. 

[20] It follows that the use of the singular form of ""sentence"" in s 6(3) does not mean an aggregation of sentences, merely because use of the singular may import the plural. No doubt an appeal under s 5(1) may relate to more than one conviction or sentence; but if an offender appeals against one only of three convictions, the Court is not empowered to consider the validity of other convictions. The same is true of sentences. The question is not whether separate ""appeals"" are required in relation to separate sentences - see [80] below - but rather to identify the matter with respect to which an applicant has sought to invoke this Court's jurisdiction. In fact, in the present case, separate grounds challenged the sentencing which achieved the aggregate term of mandatory incarceration (ground 2) and the sentence for the escape (ground 3). In relation to ground 2, a complaint as to the degree of accumulation of one or more sentences would be an appeal in respect of each sentence. Despite finding error, the Court could (and does) decline to intervene: that is separate from the proper approach in addressing ground 3. 

[21] As a matter of statutory construction, the approach adopted by Adams J in Marinellis is correct. In its terms, s 6(3) is concerned with an individual sentence (or sentences, if more than one is challenged). It requires that this Court form a view as to whether some other sentence, whether more or less severe, is ""warranted in law and should have been passed"". If the Court is of that opinion, it is obliged to quash the sentence and impose such other sentence in substitution: if it is not of that opinion, it is obliged to dismiss the appeal. Section 6(3) neither requires nor permits the Court to form an opinion about some other sentence, let alone an aggregation of sentences passed in respect of a variety of offences; nor is its dual obligation conditioned upon the existence of an opinion other than with respect to a sentence for a particular offence. Section 6(3) gives an appellate court no mandate to impose a sentence otherwise than according to law. It allows a discretion where different results are available in exercise of the power to sentence. It does not provide any authority to exceed powers elsewhere conferred. If the error were in imposing an additional term commensurate with the total period of incarceration, rather than that appropriate to the only relevant conviction, for this Court not to intervene would be to repeat the jurisdictional error. Accordingly, if this Court is satisfied that some other sentence was warranted in law with respect to the offence of escape from lawful custody, it is the obligation of the Court to impose that sentence. 

[22] Further, if there is some doubt or uncertainty about the proper construction of that provision (contrary to the views expressed above), that doubt or uncertainty should be resolved in favour of applying the rule of law and correcting legal error, an approach which conforms to the principle that, where the liberty of the individual is in issue, uncertainty or ambiguity should be resolved in a manner which favours the liberty of the individual: see Smith v Corrective Services Commission (NSW) [1980] HCA 49; 147 CLR 134 at 139 (Stephen, Mason, Murphy, Aickin and Wilson JJ); Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment [2005] HCA 58; 224 CLR 193 at [45] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ); Piper v Corrective Services Commission (NSW) (1986) 6 NSWLR 352 at 361D (Kirby P, Hope and Samuels JJA). 

[23] The proper construction of s 6(3) does not, however, necessarily resolve questions relating to the application of the principle of totality and interference with the structure of multiple sentences. That exercise should be carried out in this Court, as it would be by a trial judge, by fixing an appropriate sentence for each offence, determining whether in principle they should be served concurrently, cumulatively or partly cumulatively and then considering whether the overall aggregation imposes a total effective period of imprisonment which requires adjustment downwards. The appropriate practice in this regard permits a degree of flexibility: see, eg, Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 at [18]-[26] (Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ). No doubt the reduction of any particular sentence is a variation of the sentence; a variation of the date of commencement of the sentence (and hence its termination date absent variation in length) is also a variation of a sentence. Whether such variations are now to be undertaken in the case of multiple sentences pursuant to s 6(3) or s 7(1A) need not be determined in the present case. It is a practice frequently undertaken and its validity can be addressed when necessary. 

[24] On the other hand, having determined that another sentence is appropriate with respect to a particular offence on an appeal by an offender, it would seem to be inappropriate to decline to intervene because the overall period of imprisonment could have been restructured so as to achieve the same result. That is not what s 6(3) requires or permits, for reasons given above. If the approach adopted in Kerr v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 133 (McCallum J, Beazley JA and Johnson J agreeing), at [36] is to be read as taking a different approach, both it and the other authorities adopting a similar view, may need to be reconsidered. However, it is not necessary to resolve that issue in the present case, because a relevant restructuring could not achieve an appropriate variation to give the present result.""

70Price J, disagreed with Basten JA's judgment on this point, preferring the view expressed in R v Bottin [2005] NSWCCA 254 as to the operation of s 6(3). His Honour said -

""[79] To my mind, the view expressed in Bottin as to the operation of s 6(3) is to be preferred ...

[81] Although ""sentence"" in... [s 6(3)] is in the singular, the presumption is that words in the singular will include the plural unless the contrary intention appears. There is no indication that plurality is to be excluded. The opening words ""On an appeal under section 5(1)"" suggest on the other hand that the singular includes the plural. Section 5(1)(c) relevantly provides: 

""A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the Court: 
...

(c) with the leave of the court against the sentence passed on the person's conviction.""

[82] Where an offender has been convicted of more than one offence and more than one sentence is imposed, there is one appeal to this Court although that appeal may be founded on a number of grounds. As in the present appeal, separate appeals are not required for the individual sentences imposed. ""Sentence"" in that subsection refers, it seems to me, to the total sentence and not, where there is more than one sentence, to the sentence imposed in respect of one offence. It follows, in my opinion, that on an appeal under s 5(1) that the operation of s 6(3) is not confined to the sentence imposed in respect of one offence and that ""sentence"" includes the overall effective sentence. As was said by Hidden J at [65] in R v Georgiou [2005] NSWCCA 237: 

""...For the purposes of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, the focus should be upon that global sentence and, unless it is more severe than is warranted in law, this Court normally should not intervene at all.""""

In the result, Price J agreed with Basten JA in Arnaout that it was not necessary to resolve the issue as to the overriding significance of the global sentence, since ""a restructuring of the sentences by this Court could not achieve the same overall sentence... imposed by the [sentencing] judge."" The sentence for the escape charge was therefore reduced.

71 With respect to Price J, the question is not resolved by asking whether more than one appeal is brought where a number of sentences are challenged. The question is, rather, (as Basten JA pointed out at [20] in the above quotation) whether a sentence which is not appealed from should be treated as though it were. Similarly, so far as s 6(3) is concerned, the reading of ""sentence"" as ""sentences"" does not resolve the question, which is whether ""sentence"" can be read as ""aggregate sentence"". (I have already pointed out the limited application of Bottin.)

72The last case in which this problem was discussed is McMahon v R [2011] NSWCCA 147. That case concerned an application for leave to appeal from the sentences imposed on 39 counts of tax fraud and 42 counts of identity fraud. The sentencing judge adopted the approach of dividing the offences into categories in relation to which he made an assessment of their relative seriousness, then passing sentence in relation to each group of offences and applying the principle of totality to the result. Amongst the consequences of this approach was that identical sentences, in respect of the tax fraud offences were imposed where the amount involved varied very considerably from $488 to $57,060, the argument of course being that the larger the amount the greater the criminality and therefore the heavier the sentence and, conversely the offences involving much smaller amounts should have attracted much lower sentences. Ultimately, the grounds requiring determination by the Court were that the sentencing judge erred in failing to set an appropriate sentence for each count, failing properly to apply the principle of totality and in the approach to accumulation and concurrence, together with other grounds, again, in substance, affecting each of the sentences imposed. Hoeben J (with whom Hodgson JA and Grove AJ agreed) proposed that leave to appeal be granted and the appeal be dismissed. The Court had received submissions on the question whether ""some other sentence"" in s 6(3) is a reference to each individual sentence under appeal or to the overall effective sentence, noting the different views expressed in Arnaout. Hodgson JA said in this respect - 

""[3] It is not necessary to resolve this difference in this case; but I would note that, even if the phrase were to be taken as referring to each individual sentence, it is not correct to say that the Court cannot, in considering whether some other sentence is warranted, take into account other sentences imposed on the appellant. For example: 

(1) The other sentences may be directly relevant to the criminality involved in the particular offence (for example, showing it to be part of planned ongoing criminal activity). 

(2) If a ground of appeal raises questions of concurrency or accumulation, other sentences must necessarily be considered. 

(3) Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 shows that there is not an absolute prohibition on adjusting an individual sentence by reason of considerations of totality. 

(4) Where, as in this case, a single non-parole period has been fixed in respect of a number of federal offences, as required by s 19AB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), consideration of the adequacy of any individual sentence, which would ordinarily take into account the extent of full-time custody involved, must necessarily have regard to the totality.

[4] Further, if an application for leave to appeal is made, and error in one sentence is shown but no practical result would be achieved because no lesser total sentence would be imposed as a result of a successful appeal, it would be open to the court to refuse leave to appeal on that ground.""

73None of these examples, as I understand them, shed light upon the problem in the present appeal. 

74With respect to those who differ on this point, I consider that the approach expressed by Hulme J in Smith, by me in Marinellis and, with further explication, by Basten JA in Arnaout is correct, at least in a situation such as the present where the appeal is confined to one sentence which is imposed prior to and entirely separate from the subsequent sentence for another charge, even though, in respect of the latter, it was committed as a part of the criminal activity generally being undertaken at the time of the earlier sentence. At all events, this case comes well within the exception mentioned by Hidden J in Smith (above quoted at [53]) where the approach his Honour preferred should not be adopted where ""[although] linked in time, the ... offences were of a different nature and were unrelated"". The commercial supply was, to use his Honour's phrase ""an entirely discrete offence"" and a sentence affected by error which, of itself, was such that a lesser sentence was warranted, ""[should] not be allowed to stand simply on the basis that the overall sentence was a fair reflection of the criminality of all ... offences"".

Conclusion

75I propose the following orders - 

(1)Grant leave to appeal.

(2)Allow the appeal.

(3)Quash the sentence and substitute the following sentence:

(i) The appellant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months commencing 1 July 2008 and ending on 31 October 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months.

(4) The sentence imposed on 24 February 2012 is varied to commence on 1 November 2012.

76It follows that the non-parole period currently being served by the appellant expired on 30 May 2013. By virtue of s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the Court is required to direct the appellant's immediate release on parole. 

77BEECH-JONES J: I have had the advantage of reading a draft of the judgment of Adams J. His Honour's judgment relieves me of the necessity to set out the background to the application for leave to appeal.

78I agree that that the sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant in 2010 on count 2 of the indictment to which he had pleaded guilty in November 2009 (the ""first indictment"") by attaching a significance to the non parole period that was not warranted having regard to the High Court's decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. In my view that conclusion follows from a consideration of the extracts from the sentencing judgment noted in the judgment of Adams J at [16] to [17]. The judgment in Muldrock was published subsequent to the sentencing judgment in this case.

79The next question that arises is whether any lesser sentence for that count is warranted in law (s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912). As noted by Adams J the sentencing judge applied a discount to each of the two offences on the first indictment of 35 per cent having regard to his plea and s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the ""Sentencing Act""). This meant that for count 2 the notional starting point for the sentence prior to any discount was a head sentence of 11 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months. If this arithmetic is extended, then the combined head sentence for counts 1 and 2 prior to the application of any discount was 12 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 9 years and 5 months.

80The applicant was clearly operating a substantial retail enterprise selling illegal drugs. The scale of the enterprise is confirmed by the offences on the form 1 which included an offence of dealing with proceeds of crime being the not insignificant amount of $616,000.00 in cash that was found at premises connected with the applicant.

81The sentencing judge recorded the following:

""The Crown submitted that each of the offences is aggravated as the offender was on bail for some of the Form 1 matters when he committed them. I find the offences aggravated in this way.""

82The ""Form 1 matters"" included a number of offences of supply prohibited drugs committed in April 2007 and September 2007. Counts 1 and 2 being ""each of the offences"" referred to in the sentencing judge's comments were committed in October 2007.

83In this case a very significant matter affecting the approach to sentencing on count 2 was the number and seriousness of the offences listed on the form 1. The sentencing judge stated that they were taken into account ""with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate ... by giving greater weight to the need for personal deterrence"" which the commission of those offences indicates ought to be given and ""to the community's entitlement to exact retribution"". These observations reflected the discussion in the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Attorney General's Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 at [42] concerning the significance of offences listed on a form 1 to sentencing for the ""principal offence"" as referred to in subsection 32(1) of the Sentencing Act. 

84In addition, each of the five judgments in Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115 confirm that the reference in s 33(2) of the Sentencing Act to taking into account offences on a form 1 warrants a consideration of the criminality involved in those offences and can justify the imposition of a longer sentence for the ""principal offence"" provided that no separate sentence is imposed for the form 1 offences (at [22] to [23] per Bathurst CJ; at [64] per Basten JA; at [102] to [107] per Hoeben CJ at CL; at [154] per Garling J and at [255] to [256] per Campbell J). As noted by Bathurst CJ the sentence imposed may be ""significantly longer"" (at [23] with whom Garling and Campbell JJ agreed). Further, all of the judgments in Abbas are consistent with this Court's earlier decision in R v Grube [2005] NSWCCA 140 which was to the effect that the process of taking into account offences on a form 1 can warrant the imposition of a sentence that is higher than the appropriate range for the criminality involved in the principal offence (at [36] to [37] per Hall J with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed).

85Count 2 on the first indictment involved the applicant supplying a very substantial quantity of illegal drugs while released on bail for similar offences. Most significantly the total criminality disclosed by that offence and the form 1 offences warranted a substantial penalty and one that was ""significantly longer"" than would have been imposed had count 2 stood alone (Abbas at [23] per Bathurst CJ). Those offences reveal the additional need for deterrence of the applicant and retribution for count 2 (Abbas id). The supply occurred as part of the applicant's business of supplying illegal drugs at a retail level, which was substantial. Even allowing for the discount of 35 per cent and the applicant's subjective case including the more favourable matters revealed by the sentencing judgment for the offences dealt with in 2012, I am satisfied that no lesser sentence is warranted in law. 

86This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the issue raised by Adams J as to whether the reference in ""sentence"" in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act is confined to those sentences that are the subject of the application for leave to appeal or embrace all of the sentences an offender is serving even if some of them have not been the subject of an appeal by either the offender or the Crown (see Arnaout v R [2008] NSWCCA 278; 191 A Crim R 149 at [19] to [24] per Basten JA; R v Smith [2005] NSWCCA 339 at [37] per Hulme J; Marinellis v R [2006] NSWCCA 307 at [66] per Adams J; cf Arnaout at [78] per Price J; R v Bottin [2005] NSWCCA 254 at [37] per Studdert J with whom Kirby and Howie JJ agreed; Kerr v R [2008] NSWCCA 133 at [36] per McClellan CJ at CL; Beazley JA and Johnson J agreeing).

87Otherwise I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that a minor adjustment in the applicable sentence is warranted having regard to the time spent by the applicant in custody before he was granted bail.

88I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

2706519,New South Wales Crime Commission v Namoa [2013] NSWSC 904,"EXTEMPORE Judgment

1By summons filed on 1 March 2013, the plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission, sought orders under s 28A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 in respect of the defendant, Mr Namoa, as well as orders under s 31D(1)(a) and (c) of that Act. Orders under s 101 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 for interest were also sought, as well as orders for costs.

2The summons was accompanied by a statement of facts and circumstances signed on 25 February 2013 by the plaintiff's solicitor, Ms Bishop. Annexed to that statement was a New South Wales police facts sheet which indicated that Mr Namoa had been the subject of a police investigation as the result of which he had been arrested on 20 February 2013. He was then found to be in possession of a very large sum of Australian currency, which was seized. That was then estimated to amount to something between $500,000 and one million dollars. 

3The proceedings came before the Registrar in March, when orders were made requiring the application be served on Mr Namoa. There was today no appearance again by Mr Namoa, who it has been revealed is presently in custody.

4Today the Crime Commission presses for orders to be made pursuant to s 31D(1), requiring Mr Namoa to be examined on oath before a Registrar. That application is supported by a number of affidavits. 

5An affidavit of service sworn by Sergeant Brendan Donnellan on 5 March 2013 attests that the sergeant served a sealed copy of the summons and statement of facts on Mr Namoa at the Silverwater Correctional Centre on 5 March 2013. An affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the director financial investigations of the New South Wales Crime Commission attests that various correspondence and an affidavit which Mr Spark swore on 6 June have also been served on Mr Namoa. 

6In the circumstances the Crime Commission sought to have the hearing proceed ex-parte. I am satisfied that a basis for that application has been established.

7Mr Spark deposed in his June affidavit as to various investigations which have been conducted as to the circumstances in which the application presently before the Court came to be made and pressed. Mr Spark deposed to his belief as to the truth of the contents of a New South Wales police force facts sheet prepared by Detective Candace Williams which was annexed to his affidavit and the basis of that belief. Also annexed to the affidavit is a court attendance notice which reveals that Mr Namoa has been charged with offences under s 193B of the Crimes Act 1900 of knowingly deal with proceeds of crime; under s 193B(3) of the Crimes Act of recklessly deal with proceeds of crime; and under s 527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act of unlawfully obtained goods personal custody.

8Searches of the COPS database in relation to Mr Namoa indicates that the amount of currency seized by police in February 2013, when Mr Namoa was arrested, amounts to approximately one million dollars. It is in those circumstances that the Crime Commission presses for orders under s 31D of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act which provides that the Court may, on application of the Commission, make orders for the examination of a person on oath. 

9Section 31D provides for the orders sought to be made when an application for a confiscation order is made. A confiscation order is defined in s 4 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act to mean an assets forfeiture order, proceeds assessment order, or unexplained wealth order. It is the latter order under s 28A of the Act which the Commission seeks in these proceedings.

10It is settled that the fact that criminal charges are outstanding is not of itself a basis upon which an application for examination orders will be refused (see New South Wales Crime Commission v Jason Lee [2012] NSWCA 276). I also note that in the event of questions and answers given at an examination being considered to prejudice a criminal trial there are protections available under s 13A of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act as to self-incrimination (see Lee and New South Wales Crime Commission v Choi [2012] NSWCC 658). 

11In all of the circumstances, on the material on which the applicant Crime Commission relies, I am satisfied that the orders sought should be made in the terms proposed. I order accordingly.

2706541,Tabuan v R [2013] NSWCCA 143,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Harrison J.

2HARRISON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by Frearson DCJ on 3 August 2012 after his conviction following a jury trial on a single count that he knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 2 months commencing on 18 June 2012 and expiring on 17 August 2014 with a non-parole period of 16 months expiring on 17 October 2013. The applicant was acquitted by the same jury on a charge that he knowingly took part in the supply of 460 grams of methylamphetamine, being an amount not less than the commercial quantity, contrary to s 25(2) of the Act.

3This application raises the difficult issue of the extent to which a sentencing judge can legitimately make findings consistent with a jury's verdict where the evidence does not necessarily establish all of the facts required by the judge for that purpose. That issue is reflected in the first two of the applicants grounds of appeal, all of which are as follows:

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant was aware that the drug transaction was ""substantial"" and in the order of 150 grams of methylamphetamine.

Ground 2: His Honour erred in placing too much weight on the quantity being ""substantial""/150 grams in reaching the appropriate sentence.

Ground 3: His Honour erred in failing to allow procedural fairness to the applicant by finding that the quantity involved was substantial and in the order of 150 grams, without providing the applicant the opportunity to make submissions to the contrary.

Ground 4: The applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance due to the disparity of his sentence and the sentence of Joel Tongol.

Background

4The facts reveal that on 28 January 2010 at about 7.45pm, an undercover officer purchased 460 grams of methylamphetamine for $185,000 from Jose De Vera at the Marrickville Shopping Centre. There were a number of vehicles present at the time, one of which was driven by the applicant. It was parked 15 metres from the exit ramp of the shopping centre car park near Smidmore Road. That vehicle had travelled there in convoy with other vehicles from a business known as Solar Tint at West Ryde earlier that afternoon. Mr De Vera and a man named Jose Tongol were arrested at the scene. The Crown alleged that the applicant acted in some otherwise unspecified role providing security at the scene. Also arrested at the scene were Gerry Baquiran and Rowena Olaivar. Mr Baquiran was the owner of the Solar Tint business and he knew the applicant.

5The applicant's role in the operation was somewhat curious. He had become involved in the supply only on the day of the arrests and possibly as late as 4.55pm. He spent the afternoon of 28 January 2010 at the Solar Tint office before driving to Marrickville. There was no evidence at the trial that he witnessed or was privy to any of the dealings by others with the drugs, including cutting with some additive in a bedroom upon the premises. There was also no evidence that the applicant became aware in fact of the quantity of the drug that was ultimately supplied.

6A significant part of the police operation that culminated in the arrests included electronic surveillance and telephone intercepts. Mr De Vera's phone was recorded as having in excess of 14,000 intercepted calls and SMS messages. The undercover operative was in communication with over 20 people who were part of the drug syndicate being investigated. With one exception, the applicant did not figure in any of these intercepted calls or dealings. There was no evidence that the applicant was ever involved in any respect at all prior to his arrival at the Solar Tint premises on the afternoon in question. None of his co-accused referred to him. No objective evidence such as DNA or fingerprints relating to the applicant was recovered. Whilst a two-way radio was found in Mr Baquiran's vehicle, the applicant had no such device.

7The exception referred to arose in the course of an intercepted telephone conversation between a Mr Capilli and Mr Baquiran in the moments before the convoy left West Ryde. Mr Capilli is recorded as telling Mr Baquiran that he would be going (presumably driving or travelling to Marrickville) with the applicant. His response was, ""Shit, I don't want them. Why am I going with them?"" and later, ""I'd rather be on my own."" Later still Mr Baquiran is recorded as telling Mr Capilli, ""if you want [to] let them stay and watch the place then the two of us together...do they know it's going to [be] big?"" Mr Capilli responded, ""They're there not to do anything but just stay and watch"".

8There was no evidence at the trial or at the sentencing proceedings about what, if any, financial reward the applicant was to receive as a result of his involvement in the transaction. His acquittal on the first count clearly indicates that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about his knowledge concerning the quantity of methylamphetamine that was supplied.

Findings

9His Honour found that the applicant was at the lower end of the hierarchy of those involved. He found that his role was to provide security at the car park. His Honour also found that the applicant was aware that the drug transaction was substantial and in the order of 150 grams of methylamphetamine and that he was involved for his own financial gain. His Honour found that the applicant had no relevant antecedents but denied him leniency otherwise available to someone with an unblemished record. He took account of the fact that the applicant was otherwise a person of good character, that he was unlikely to reoffend and that he had fair to good prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour found special circumstances.

10His Honour's remarks on sentence were relevantly in the following terms:

""I am required to find facts that are consistent with the verdict, as I said, and the offender's version of events has been rejected by the jury clearly beyond reasonable doubt, not surprisingly I would add, because the version did present as inherently implausible and unbelievable. There was much planning and effort that went into the transaction, much co-ordination and clearly, on any realistic view of the efforts made by those involved, what was going down at the car park was some substantial drug dealing which required a deal of security. 

I am constrained by the verdict of the jury not to make any fact-finding as to the awareness of the accused regarding the quantity that would reach the threshold of the commercial quantity of 250 grams. I am satisfied that the offender was well aware that what was taking place was a substantial drug transaction and he must have been aware that it was in the order of 150 grams or thereabouts, or something like that, otherwise there would not have been the necessity for the elaborate arrangements that were made to secure the transaction.

It is a very serious example of this type of offence. I appreciate that the quantity itself is not decisive. When I say the 'quantity' even the offender's awareness as to the quantity that he was involved in, it is not decisive as to criminality but it remains as a relevant consideration.

I accept the characterisation of the accused's role as providing security for the transaction. I do accept that he was at the lower end of the hierarchy of those involved. I do accept that he took place in it obviously for financial gain, I do not know what that was but it clearly was for financial gain.""


Consideration

11The applicant contended that there was no direct of inferential evidentiary basis for his Honour's finding that the applicant knew that the supply transaction involved a substantial amount of methylamphetamine in the order of 150 grams.

12The principles guiding a judge in sentencing following a jury verdict are well known and often stated. They have been sufficiently summarised by the High Court in Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1 at [14] as follows:

""[14] In Isaacs the Court of Criminal Appeal summarized certain well-established principles concerning the law and practice of sentencing in New South Wales as follows (omitting references to authority): 

'1. Where, following a trial by jury, a person has been convicted of a criminal offence, the power and responsibility of determining the punishment to be inflicted upon the offender rest with the judge, and not with the jury ... 

2. Subject to certain constraints, it is the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to sentencing. Some of these facts will have emerged in evidence at the trial; others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings. ... 

3. The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision-making referred to above is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. ... 

4. A second constraint is that findings of fact made against an offender by a sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt. 

5. There is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender upon the basis of the view of the facts, consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender. ... However, the practical effect of 4 above, in a given case, may be that, because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, then the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender. ...'"" 

13The applicant submitted that his Honour's finding that he was well aware that what was taking place was a substantial drug transaction in the order of 150 grams was a finding made against the applicant and as such was a finding that could only be made following satisfaction to the criminal standard. He contended that the evidence did not support and could not permit any such findings.

14What was clear was that the applicant had no history of any previous involvement in drug supply or possession. The evidence was silent as to his knowledge or even his familiarity with drug deals or drug supply at any level or on any scale. The evidence did not permit any conclusions as to the applicant's knowledge or understanding of what occurred in terms either of dollar amounts or weighted quantities. 

15The evidence was also silent upon, and arguably did not support adverse findings about, the extent to which the applicant had been involved in the transaction either prior to 4.55pm at West Ryde or thereafter. There was correspondingly no evidence that permitted or supported an adverse finding against the applicant that he knew of the ""elaborate arrangements that were made to secure the transaction."" The evidence only went as far as to support the fact that the applicant was sitting in a car near the car park exit.

16The reference by one of the co-offenders to whether or not ""they"" knew how big it was going to be is not evidence that ""they"" did know. It is not evidence that the applicant knew anything at all. There was little evidence that the security arrangements were anything at all, and on one view there was no evidence that they were ""substantial"". In any event, the inferences that are available as to the applicant's state of knowledge that can be drawn from the fact that he was present in a car ""as security"" are necessarily limited.

17In my view there was insufficient evidence available to his Honour from any combination of the surrounding circumstances to support an inference about the applicant's state of knowledge or understanding of the size or scale of the transaction being undertaken. Whether or not something qualifies as substantial is a relative consideration. It implies a comparison with something else to give it that quality. There is no evidence available in the present case that assisted or permitted his Honour to make such a comparison and hence to make such a finding. It was not in my view open to his Honour to be satisfied about the applicant's knowledge or understanding of what was happening beyond reasonable doubt, apart from what flows directly from the unexplained verdict of the jury.

18In my view, through no fault on his part, his Honour was faced with a situation contemplated by the fifth principle from Isaacs extracted above. In other words, the state of the evidence upon the question of the applicant's knowledge of the size or scale of the drug transaction with which the jury found him to be concerned was so vague and unsatisfactory that his Honour was not in a position to make findings beyond reasonable doubt. That left his Honour in the position of having to resolve any doubt about the issue in a way that favoured the applicant.

19His Honour proceeded to make a series of findings that were favourable to the applicant. No challenge to them is made. The only findings that are challenged are the findings that the applicant was aware that the drug transaction was substantial and in the order of 150 grams of methylamphetamine. The result of a determination that it was not open to his Honour to reach those conclusions beyond reasonable doubt is that his Honour should have sentenced on a view of the facts that was most favourable to the applicant. In the events that occurred, that impels a finding that the applicant took part in an offence meeting the minimum requirements of s 25(1) of the Act and no more. His Honour's description of the applicant's role as being at the lower end of the hierarchy conformed to that approach but his Honour's challenged findings did not. Just in the way that the jury were apparently, if not obviously, unable to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had knowingly taken part in a transaction in an amount of 460 grams of the drug, so was it not open to his Honour to find that the applicant's knowledge extended to the detail of any particular quantity. The jury's verdict and the facts only supported a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant knowingly took part in the supply of a quantity of a prohibited drug.

20In my opinion it follows that grounds 1 and 2 have been made out. It therefore becomes unnecessary to consider ground 3.

21The question that arises is whether in the circumstances some other sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted in law and should have been passed. It is convenient to consider the applicant's fourth ground of appeal in this context.

22The applicant's co-offender Joel Tongol pleaded guilty to the same count as that of which the applicant was acquitted. As already indicated, the maximum penalty for that offence is 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The sentencing judge took into account two matters on a Form 1, namely, participating in a criminal group between 9 December 2009 and 28 January 2010, which carries a maximum penalty of five years, and supplying not less than the commercial quantity, namely 268.75 grams of methylamphetamine, also carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years. Mr Tongol pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial and received a 10 percent discount for his plea. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.

23Mr Tongol's role was greater than the applicant's. He drove the van that carried the drugs. The sentencing judge described his role as involving the distribution of small amounts of methylamphetamine to customers in Sydney, which was relevant to his knowledge and understanding of the magnitude of the subject offence. On the day of the arrest Mr Tongol was heard to be discussing where and when the transaction was to take place, demonstrating his close association with what subsequently occurred. He also assisted in cutting the drugs. Mr Tongol's association with the syndicate spanned just over two months. He had full knowledge of the quantity of the drug and was directly involved in the planning and organisation of its distribution. He participated for financial gain. The sentencing judge described him as ""an active member of the drug syndicate"". The starting point of his sentence was five years.

24The applicant argued on principles of parity that he was entitled in those circumstances to have a justifiable sense of grievance at the disparity between his sentence and Mr Tongol's sentence.

25In my opinion there is no basis for substituting some other less severe sentence for that imposed by his Honour, either upon the basis that the errors identified lead to such a result or upon the basis that the applicant is entitled to feel aggrieved at the way his sentence compares to that imposed upon Mr Tongol.

26To start with, it does not seem to me that his Honour fell into error in the imposition of the sentence he formulated. It is not insignificant that no challenge is mounted against the sentence imposed upon the basis that it is manifestly excessive. Nor could it be. The maximum penalty for the offence of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug is 15 years imprisonment. Neither the head sentence nor the non-parole period could be described as other than at the lowest end of the range. His Honour could presumably have sentenced the applicant to a lower sentence but in the exercise of his discretion he chose not to do so. Even if his Honour had not made the findings concerning the applicant's ""knowledge"" of the amount of drug involved or about whether he must have known that the transaction was substantial, his Honour could nevertheless in the proper exercise of his discretion have imposed the same sentence. The identified errors do not mean that some other sentence is warranted in law. His Honour's sentencing discretion was not relevantly infected with an error that invalidated the conclusions on sentence to which he came.

27Further, I do not consider that the applicant can have a justifiable sense of grievance in the circumstances that he identifies. It is sufficient to observe that the sentence imposed upon Mr Tongol was on one available view somewhat lenient. That is particularly so having regard to the fact that Mr Tongol was sentenced for a s 25(2) offence and had further matters on a Form 1. That arguably fortunate outcome for Mr Tongol should not lead to the conclusion that the applicant's sentence is unfairly harsh by comparison. The discrepancy between the two sentences should not lead to the conclusion that in the case of the applicant some other lesser sentence is warranted in law.

28As an additional matter I consider that it is important to recognise that the judges in the District Court are faced on a daily basis with an almost unending onslaught of serious and complex sentencing exercises. The fact that an error or errors may be identified upon quiet reflection by others in circumstances that are unconstrained by the pressures under which the judges are required to operate is neither surprising nor derogatory. There is no doubt that the process must be undertaken according to the detailed and difficult sentencing principles that guide all sentencing judges. But where, as in this case, the sentencing judge passes a sentence that in all of the circumstances of the case is a proper sentence howsoever it is viewed, it is not appropriate to make minor adjustments to the result in order only to give some practical recognition of or endorsement to the identified error if it is not otherwise warranted.

Conclusions and orders

29In my opinion the following orders should be made:

1. Grant leave to appeal.

2. Dismiss the appeal.

30BEECH-JONES J: I agree with the judgment of Harrison J and the orders his Honour proposes.

		25 June 2013",2013-06-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706547,R v Fabian Michael [2013] NSWSC 854,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1Fabian Michael is an Applicant for bail today. His application came before me last Thursday, 20 June 2013 and was adjourned to today, so I could consider all the materials advanced on his behalf.

2On 21 March 2013 the Applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal against his conviction of one count of doing an act intending to pervert the course of justice contrary to Crimes Act 1900 s 319. The facts alleged and established by the Applicant's conviction were that the Applicant advised a person involved in an incident being investigated by police to give a false version of events to police. The Applicant was tried before Judge Payne and a jury in the District Court at Parramatta commencing on 21 August 2012. The jury returned its verdict of guilty on 29 August 2012. After that verdict the Applicant Judge Payne granted bail to the Applicant until his sentence hearing. He was finally sentenced on 21 March 2013 to imprisonment for two years and three months with a non-parole period of fifteen months. The Applicant has been in prison ever since.

3An appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 has not yet been filed. So the Applicant comes before the Court in circumstances where a little over three months, or 20%, of his non-parole period has been served, a non-parole period which will expire in June 2014. Senior and junior counsel for the Applicant, Mr Sutherland SC and Mr Kintominas indicate that were the appeal to be filed presently, that even with expedition, the Applicant's appeal against conviction could probably not be heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal until near the end of this year, if not early next year.

4The first question is the power of a single judge sitting in the bails list to grant bail in these circumstances. In a judgment such as this it is not necessary to set out all the applicable legislative provisions, which are well known. But I will explain the basis of the Court's jurisdiction in summary form. 

5Leaving aside the Court's inherent jurisdiction, Bail Act 1978 (""Bail Act"") Part 4 might be seen to confer the power to grant bail after conviction and on appeal only to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Bail Act Part 4 Division 4 - Supreme Court s 28 confers power on the Supreme Court to grant bail ""to any person accused of any offence"" whether or not the person has appeared before the Supreme Court in connection with that offence. This at first seems a somewhat inapt description of a person who has already been convicted of an offence. Bail Act Part 4 Division 5 - Court of Criminal Appeal appears to deal with what happens after conviction. Bail Act s 30, within Division 5 confers power on the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant bail ""in accordance with this Act to any person accused of an offence"" in circumstances where there is ""an appeal pending in the Court"". It seems clear that if a person who has lodged an appeal can be described as someone ""accused of an offence, then the power in Bail Act s 28 using the same language ""accused of any offence"" must be broad enough to cover a person not only accused, but convicted, of an offence. 

6This construction is supported by two other matters. In Bail Act s 4 the word ""offence"" is defined inclusively. It ""includes an alleged offence"", supporting the construction that it may also mean ""convicted of an offence"". In placing limitations on the power to grant bail, Bail Act s 30AA says ""bail should not be granted by the Court of Criminal Appeal or any other Court unless it is established that special or exceptional circumstances exist justifying the grant of bail"" [emphasis added]. Thus Bail Act Part 4 Division 4 contemplates that ""any other Court"" can grant bail pending appeal. Moreover, this is the manner in which courts have interpreted the provisions: DPP v Cassaniti [2006] NSWCCA 335 (Basten JA, Bell J and Johnson J).

7The Applicant can be granted bail before filing his appeal. The language of Bail Act s 30 and s30AA is that the Court of Criminal Appeal or any other Court may grant bail if ""an appeal is pending in the Court"" in connection with the offence. But Criminal Appeal Act s 10 makes it clear that those words encompass the Applicant's Notice of Intention to Appeal filed on 21 March this year. Criminal Appeal Act s 10(2)(b) provides that for the purposes of any other Act or statutory instrument an ""appeal against a conviction or sentence is taken to be pending in the Court if notice of intention to appeal or apply for leave to appeal has been duly given to the Court."" There is no doubt that has happened in this case. It seems to me there is no procedural obstacle to me dealing with this application.

8I have been referred to many authorities on the meaning of the words ""special or exceptional circumstances exist justifying the grant of bail"" in Bail Act s 30AA. Authority makes clear that the term within Bail Act s 30AA is not limited to questions of the strength of the appeal, although such considerations are obviously central to the Court's task: R v Joseph Antoun [2005] NSWCCA 270 at 14 and 15 (Simpson, Johnson and Rothman JJ).

9In my view there are Bail Act s 30AA special and exceptional circumstances established here, warranting the grant of bail to this Applicant.

10The Crown opposes bail and points to the Applicant's conviction and his strong motivation not to attend Court and the need to protect the community in relation to what is a serious offence. Although the Crown concedes there is a presumption in favour of bail for this offence, it identifies the obstacles to that bail from Bail Act s 30AA. The Applicant's case of ""special or exceptional circumstances"" justifying the ground of bail is based upon four factors: his current medical condition, his current psychological condition, the strength of his appeal and the probability of his answering bail. I will deal with the last of these matters first.

11Despite the Applicant's conviction there is little doubt he will answer bail. He had no convictions prior to August 2012 and he complied without fail with his bail conditions from the time that he was first charged in October 2011, until his sentencing in March 2013. He has strong family connections. Substantial sureties are offered together with a regime of daily reporting to Burwood Police Station.

12The Applicant proposes to appeal against conviction and seeks an acquittal from the Court of Criminal Appeal. Whilst it is difficult on the materials presented to say that the appeal is virtually ""certain to succeed"" in the language of R v Wilson (1994) 34 NSWLR 1, the Court has been provided with detailed written submissions prepared by Mr Game SC in relation to the conviction appeal together with the relevant trial transcript. This is not the place for extensive analysis of the draft grounds of appeal. But I observe that the argument is well structured and compelling. Its final merits will no doubt be a matter for the Court of Criminal Appeal. I propose to impose as a condition of bail that an appeal be filed in the registry of the Court of Criminal Appeal by 5.00pm on 10 July 2013.

13The Applicant has a serious medical condition. Before his sentencing hearing, due to a family history of serious cardiac disease, hypertension and Type II diabetes, he underwent an ECG in February this year. The ECG indicated he has had a myocardial infarction with resulting sinus brachycardia. His general practitioner, Dr B.A. Maroun, says he needs urgent review and treatment by a cardiologist. I accept Dr Maroun's evidence that this medical treatment is needed urgently ""as he is at the risk of having serious further cardiac events, even potentially cardiac arrests"". I am satisfied from the Applicant's account of events that he is not receiving treatment within in his correctional facility with the urgency his condition deserves. 

14His medical condition is compounded by a psychological one. He was assessed by a clinical psychologist at the Silverwater Correctional Centre on 29 March 2013 and diagnosed with a stress related major depressive order. The stress associated with incarceration would not ordinarily on its own constitute special or exceptional circumstances. But in the Applicant's case the medical evidence infers that his stress related depression puts him at increased medical risk of a myocardial event. 

15There has been some delay in putting on an appeal. This is not the Applicant's fault. The evidence discloses quite intense efforts have been made to secure all the transcript of the proceedings and the remarks on sentence so that an appeal against conviction and any application for leave to appeal on sentence could be filed together. The Applicant is in a position to achieve at least the former. And that is what should now be done. 

16In my view the Applicant has made out the special or exceptional circumstances justifying bail pending appeal. It is difficult to forecast when this matter will come before the Court of Criminal Appeal. Unless bail were granted now a very substantial part of the non-parole period of the Applicant's sentence would probably be served before his appeal is heard. Having regard to his prior compliance with bail conditions pending trial there is no reason to fear his non-attendance. To deprive him of bail at this stage may well deprive him of the benefit of his appeal should he be successful. For those reasons I will grant bail upon the following terms:

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
Offences and sentence
Two applications were before the Court. The first in point of time was an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed by his Honour Acting Judge Puckeridge in the District Court at Sydney on 14 September 2002. The second was an application for leave to appeal against sentence by the respondent on the basis of error disclosed in the sentencing process and that the overall sentence imposed was too severe in all the circumstances.

2The respondent pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated break enter and steal and one count of attempted aggravated break enter and steal, contrary to s112(2) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 5 years; four counts of break enter and steal, contrary to s112(1) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years; one deemed supply of a prohibited drug, contrary to s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 15 years; two counts of using a false document to obtain property, contrary to s254(b)(i) Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years and one count of attempting to use a false document to obtain property, contrary to s254(b)(i) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years. Also taken into account on a Form 1, pursuant to s32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act), were 19 offences of a similar kind.

3The details of the offences and the sentences imposed are set out in the Table below. The respondent was sentenced to a total head sentence of 4 years 8 months with a total non-parole period of 3 years and 11 months.

4The Crown relies upon the following Grounds of Appeal.

1. The sentencing judge erred in failing to find as an aggravating feature on sentence that the offences were committed while the respondent was subject to conditional liberty.
2. The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the Form 1 offences.
3. The sentencing judge erred in his approach to setting the aggregate sentences.
4. The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the respondent's prior record of offending.
5. The sentencing judge erred in failing to give effect to a finding of special circumstances.
6. The sentences, individually and as structured, are manifestly inadequate.

5The respondent relied upon the following Grounds of Appeal.

1. The sentencing judge erred in not giving effect to the finding of special circumstances for the total aggregate sentence.
2. The sentence imposed for the deemed supply charge is in error as the objective criminality cannot be determined in the absence of any nominated quantity of the prohibited drug pseudoephedrine.
3. The overall sentence imposed was too severe in all the circumstances of the offences, for reasons including:
The sentences for three use false instrument charges were each excessive, and
The delayed commencement of the sentence on 16th January 2012.

Factual Background

6On 18 February 2010 the respondent rented a Toyota Camry in the name of his de facto partner. At 1.20am on 19 February 2010 the respondent and a co-offender walked to a pharmacy in Carwar Avenue, Carrs Park. Both offenders were wearing balaclavas. CCTV recorded the offenders using the concrete lid of a Telstra pit to smash the glass of the pharmacy door. Both offenders entered and took all the cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine. They then left the premises and drove away in the rented Camry (aggravated BES Seq 1).

7At about 1.40am on 19 February 2010 the two offenders drove along President Avenue, Caringbah and stopped outside the Caringbah Pharmacy. By this time the Camry's registration plates had been obscured. The offenders used a concrete Telstra pit cover to smash the glass door and stole all the cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine. They then left in the Camry (aggravated BES Seq 2).

8At about 2.10am on 19 February 2010 the offenders were seen near the Miranda Pharmacy at 96 Kiora Road, Miranda. The respondent was carrying a suitcase and black gloves. He fled when a police patrol came by, but dropped a black glove which yielded his DNA. The co-offender was arrested (attempted aggravated BES Seq 3).

9The Camry was located in a nearby street. The registration plates were covered. Inside the car were 142 boxes of cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is a prohibited drug that is used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. Also found in the car were 25 bottles of cough medicine stolen from the pharmacy.

10On 16 August 2010 the respondent attended the Meadows Pharmacy at Claremont Meadows and presented a false driver's licence. He asked for a packet of Claratyne 12 hour tablets (which contain pseudoephedrine). The pharmacist refused to serve him and he left (attempt to use false document to obtain property Seq 9).

11On 10 October 2010 the respondent, using another false driver's licence, attended the Terry White Pharmacy at Plumpton and bought a packet of Codral Day and Night tablets (which contain pseudoephedrine) (use false document to obtain property Seq 6).

12On 21 October 2010 the respondent rented an Audi A4 in a false name (using one of the false driver's licences). At 12.54am he attended Harbord Pharmacy, Harbord and used a block of bricks to smash in the door. He entered and removed an amount of pseudoephedrine (BES Seq 7). 

13On 28 October 2010 at 11.12pm the respondent attended the Pitt Street Medical Centre, Merrylands. He smashed the glass door with a Telstra pit cover and stole 35 packets of pseudoephedrine based products (BES Seq 13).

14On 20 November 2010 the respondent drove his de facto's car to the Mulgoa Pharmacy, Mulgoa. The registration plates were covered with a pair of shorts. The respondent took a concrete Telstra pit cover from the car and smashed in the door of the pharmacy and stole all the pseudoephedrine based products on display (about 40 packets) (BES Seq 22).

15On 23 November 2010 the respondent drove his de facto's car to the Werrington County Pharmacy, Werrington. He stopped and picked up a concrete Telstra pit cover. The respondent stole approximately 70 packets of pseudoephedrine based products (BES Seq 25).

16On 30 November 2010 the respondent entered the Pulse Pharmacy, Parramatta and used a false driver's licence to purchase a packet of Chemists Own Sinus Relief tablets which contain pseudoephedrine (use false document to obtain property Seq 27).

17On 2 December 2010 a search warrant was executed on the respondent's residential premises. Police located a total of 110 packets of pseudoephedrine based products in the respondent's home. The respondent participated in a recorded interview and made full admissions to owning all the pseudoephedrine based products and certain admissions relating to the fraud offences.

18A further 19 offences were taken into account on a Form 1, pursuant to s32 of the Sentencing Act. These comprised 3 counts of break enter with intent, contrary to s113(1) Crimes Act 1900; 1 attempted break enter and steal, contrary to s113(1) Crimes Act 1900; 3 counts of intentionally damaging property, contrary to s195(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 (the properties being the premises broken into for the break and enter with intent offences); and 12 counts of using a false document to obtain property, contrary to s254(b)(i) Crimes Act 1900.

Respondent's subjective case

19The respondent was aged 32 at the date of the offences. He had a stable childhood but encountered learning difficulties at school and left in year 9. His employment has been sporadic, mainly driving courier trucks.

20The respondent started drinking alcohol at the age of 15, which later became problematic. By the age of 26 he told the Probation and Parole Service that he was drinking a case of beer everyday, along with spirits. He said that this level of drinking only ceased when he was in prison. He started using amphetamines in 2001 (aged 23) and the only time that he did not use amphetamines was when he was in prison. The respondent said that he had a chronic gambling problem and every day would gamble large amounts on poker machines, horses and greyhounds.

21The respondent had an extensive criminal history in NSW that started in 1996 when he was 17 years old. He had numerous convictions for driving offences (including 6 convictions for dangerous driving), high range PCA, break enter and steal, numerous fraud offences and stealing. He had been imprisoned on a number of occasions.

22The respondent also had numerous convictions in Victoria for possess material to manufacture a drug of dependence, burglary, theft, threaten serious injury and trafficking a drug of dependence.

23In 2009 the respondent was convicted in Queensland of fraud, stealing and break and enter type offences. The respondent has also spent periods in prison in Victoria and Queensland.

24At the date of committing all of the offences before the Court, the respondent was serving a suspended sentence for the Queensland offences.

25On 7 March 2010 the respondent was granted bail in NSW for (unrelated) driving offences, so that the offences that occurred after that date were committed while the respondent was on bail.

26The respondent was arrested and remanded in custody in relation to the subject offences on 2 December 2010. He had a number of outstanding driving charges (unrelated to these matters) and on 30 September 2011 the respondent was sentenced to a head sentence of 18 months with a non-parole period of 13 ½ months which expired on 16 January 2012. He was then remanded in custody on the subject matters.

27A psychological assessment, dated 24 July 2012, prepared by Claire Wood psychologist, reported that he had a stable childhood in Sydney but struggled at school and left in year 9. He had two brothers, both of whom were also in custody. He started consuming alcohol at the age of 15. He had three children but was separated from their mother.

28He told Ms Wood of his heavy drinking and uncontrolled gambling and an addiction to amphetamines. She confirmed that he suffered from substance abuse disorder. She noted that he had no insight into his alcohol and drug dependence and on release from his earlier imprisonments, felt no remorse and wished to resume his previous lifestyle. Although there was no previous diagnosis of mental illness, Ms Wood thought that he displayed traits consistent with ""internal distortions, interpersonal difficulties contributing to maladaptive behaviours in line with Antisocial and Borderline Personality Disorders"".

29Ms Wood prepared a second report, dated 2 September 2012, in which she suggested programs from which the respondent would benefit.

30A personal reference by Ms Moore, the respondent's ex-partner, was placed before the court which confirmed his drug and gambling addiction. The respondent wrote a letter to the court in which he expressed his regret for his actions and referred to his drug, alcohol and gambling addictions.

31A pre-sentence report was tendered. It described the respondent's very poor response to previous supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and noted that his periods of supervision were characterised by re-offending and a failure to address his offending behaviour.

Remarks on sentence

32The respondent came before Acting Judge Puckeridge for sentence on 4 September 2012. His Honour handed down sentence on 14 September 2012. In his remarks on sentence, his Honour recited the facts of the offending and the salient aspects of the respondent's subjective case. His Honour referred to the need for a sentence to take into account general and specific deterrence. His Honour noted that there was a standard non-parole period of 5 years applicable to the aggravated BES offences (Sequences 1 and 2) and noted that the ""offences are objectively serious"".

33His Honour gave a discount of 25 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.

34When sentencing for Sequences 1, 2 and 3 the sentencing judge said:

""I have come to the conclusion that taking into account the Form 1 it would be appropriate that an aggregate sentence of 5 years would be appropriate. That is a sentence which would have to be reduced for the pleas of guilty and the Crown concedes that there would need or not need, but it would be appropriate that there would be a full 25 percent discount which would reduce that to 45 months. The Court is also required to indicate what the sentences would be but for the aggregate sentence in relation to those three offences."" (ROS 4.9 - 5.2)

35His Honour held that a head sentence of 5 years (before the discount for the pleas of guilty) was appropriate for each of the three s112(2) offences committed on 19 February 2010. His Honour noted that there was planning involved in each offence. He also noted that as there were three discrete offences committed on that night, there ""was a need for cumulative sentences or partially cumulative"". His Honour then said:

""I consider that the totality of the criminality would be reflected therefore in an aggregate sentence taking into account the Form 1 matters, which I take into account in relation to such aggregate sentences which I sign and date today's date once I find the Form 1.""

36His Honour commenced the sentences from 16 January 2012 being the date of expiry of the non-parole period for the unrelated driving offences. His Honour then set a single non-parole period for all three s112(2) offences of 32 months or 71 percent of the head sentence. 

37His Honour found special circumstances, by reason of the respondent's need for intensive support on his release to address his addictions. Notwithstanding this finding, the total non-parole period was 83 percent of the total head sentence.

38His Honour set a sentence of 12 months for Sequence 9 (attempt to use a false instrument) with a starting date of 16 March 2012. As the entire term of that sentence was subsumed within the aggregate non-parole period set for the s112(2) offences, his Honour declined to set a non-parole period.

39In relation to Sequence 6 (use false instrument to obtain property) his Honour imposed a sentence of 15 months, to date from 16 March 2012. As the entire term of that sentence was subsumed within the aggregate non-parole period set for the s112(2) offences, his Honour declined to set a non-parole period.

40In relation to the four break enter and steal offences (Sequences 7, 13, 22 and 25) his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence of 33 months after the discount for the plea of guilty was applied with an aggregate non-parole period of 2 years. The aggregate sentence was to commence on 16 July 2013 (that is 16 months accumulation on the first aggregate sentence). The individual sentences imposed (after a discount of 25 percent) were described as:
Sequence 7 - 33 months;
Sequence 13 - 33 months with a non-parole period of 24 months.
Sequence 22 - 42 months reduced by 20 percent (his Honour did not calculate the final term but it is 31.5 months).
Sequence 25 - 33 months.

41In relation to Sequence 27 (use a false document to obtain property) the sentencing judge imposed a head sentence of 15 months with a non-parole period of 11 months starting 16 October 2014.

42For the deemed supply, his Honour imposed a head sentence of 18 months. His Honour then said that in order to give effect to his finding of special circumstances and to avoid a crushing sentence, a non-parole period of 9 months was appropriate (50 percent of the head sentence) to date from 16 March 2015. His Honour noted that a period of 10 months on parole would be sufficient for the respondent to obtain a proper treatment program.

THE APPEALS
Crown Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in failing to find as an aggravating feature on sentence that the offences were committed while the respondent was subject to conditional liberty.

43By way of further background, on 9 October 2009 the respondent was sentenced to a 4 year suspended sentence by the Brisbane District Court. The s112(2) offences (Sequences 1, 2 and 3) were committed on 19 February 2010 during the currency of that suspended sentence. On 7 March 2010 the respondent was granted bail for unrelated driving offences. All of the offences after that date were committed while he was on bail. This includes all of the Form 1 offences.

44In relation to the s112(2) offences, his Honour said, after having sentenced the respondent:

""... In relation to the first charges in which there was a question as to whether or not, he being on conditional liberty from Queensland, whether that was an aggravating feature and in respect of which the court was given no authority, I did not make any finding in relation to whether or not it was an aggravating feature, I simply took it into account, together with the standard non-parole period in relation to certainly Sequences 2 and 1, with the standard non-parole period, and considered that was appropriate in those circumstances. I just wanted to make that clear."" (ROS 16.8)

45The appellant submitted that his Honour made no reference anywhere in his remarks to the fact that the balance of the offences were committed while the respondent was on bail. The appellant submitted that s21A(2)(j) of the Sentencing Act provides that this is an aggravating feature to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence if the offences were committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty.

46The appellant relied on Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145 at [86] where Johnson J said:

""86 In Frigiani v R [2007] NSWCCA 81 at [24], it was held that the commission of an offence, whilst the offender was subject to a s10 good behaviour bond, constituted the aggravating factor listed in s21A(2)(j) of the Act regardless of the conduct in respect of which the bond was imposed. However, it was not the case in Frigiani v R that the offence for which the s10 good behaviour bond had been granted was one for which imprisonment was not an available sentence. Nevertheless, it seems to me that the purpose of s21A(2)(j) is to capture the common law principle that an offence committed whilst a person is subject to conditional liberty, whether on bail or whilst subject to a good behaviour bond or a community service order or periodic detention or parole, constitutes an aggravating factor for the purpose of sentence. The essence of the provision is that the offender commits a further offence whilst subject to an order of a court in criminal proceedings requiring, amongst other things, that the offender be of good behaviour. I do not consider that the term ""conditional liberty"" in the section is confined to circumstances where the foundational offence giving rise to the conditional liberty is one which itself must be punishable by imprisonment.

87 Even if this view was wrong, however, the common law principle remains applicable given that s 21A does not purport to codify the law in this area: s 21A(1). Even if the commission of the offences whilst the Applicant was subject to a s 10 good behaviour bond for trespass did not constitute the statutory aggravating factor, it would constitute an available aggravating factor at common law. ...""

47The appellant noted that in Stewart v R [2012] NSWCCA 183 at [18] and [70] this Court had recognised that s21A(2)(j) applies where the order imposing conditional liberty was imposed by a court in another Australian jurisdiction.

48The appellant submitted that this was a serious error on the part of the sentencing judge. By reference to Attorney General's Application (No 1) Under s26 of the Criminal Appeal Act; R v Ponfield; R v Scott; R v Ryan; R v Johnson [1999] NSWCCA 435; 48 NSWLR 327 (the guideline judgment on breaking and entering) at [48] the first matter identified as an important consideration was whether the offender was on conditional liberty at the time of the offence. The appellant submitted that not only had his Honour erred in the manner specified, but the error was a serious one which must have affected the sentencing process.

49The respondent submitted that during the sentencing proceedings the Crown made no objection to the way in which his Honour indicated that he would treat the fact that the s112(2) offences were committed while the respondent was on conditional liberty. He submitted that if the Crown's acquiescence led the sentencing judge into error, that should not be held against him. In that regard, the respondent referred to Everett and Phillips v R [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 300 where four judges of the High Court (Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Gaudron JJ) held that in an application by the Crown for leave to appeal against sentence, the Crown was bound by the stance which it had taken in the sentencing proceedings. The respondent also noted that in the passage referred to by the Crown, his Honour said that he would take that matter into account.

50It is clear that his Honour did not receive the assistance to which he was entitled in relation to the Queensland suspended sentence. As a result, I am not persuaded that his Honour gave that fact very much weight in relation to the s112(2) offences. Nevertheless, because of the stance adopted by the Crown in the sentencing proceedings, if that were the only difficulty with his Honour's approach to the sentences for those offences, I would not be prepared to intervene.

51I do, however, agree that in relation to the sentences for the balance of the offences, his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that after March 2010 the respondent was on bail. In that regard, his Honour was in error. This ground of appeal has been made out.

Crown Ground 2. The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the Form 1 offences.

52The appellant submitted that his Honour failed to properly take the Form 1 offences into account as required by Attorney-General's Application under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146. It submitted that this was clear from the indicative sentences. When specifying the sentences that would have been imposed for Sequences 1, 2 and 3 had the aggregate sentence procedure not been utilised, his Honour said that he would have imposed a 5 year head sentence for each offence. The appellant submitted that this involved error since the Form 1 offences were to be taken into account when sentencing for the offence in Sequence 1.

53The appellant submitted that this was the error identified in R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219. There McClellan CJ at CL said:

""29 It will be apparent from the portions that I have related from the sentencing judge's remarks that there are a number of errors. The sentencing judge concluded that each offence was of similar seriousness and gave no indication of the impact of the matters on the Form 1 on the sentence for the relevant offences.

...

32 Section 53A(1) allows a court to impose an aggregate sentence instead of a separate sentence of imprisonment for each count. However, s 53A(2) requires the sentencing judge to indicate to the offender the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. A sentencing judge is accordingly required to give consideration to the criminality involved in each offence and, where appropriate, have regard to any matters on a Form 1 when defining the sentence that would have been imposed for an individual offence. ...""

54In the same case RA Hulme J said:

""56 McClellan CJ at CL has referred (at [31] - [32]) to the provisions of s 53A, including the requirement in s 53A(2)(b) that a court must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence. In an apparent attempt to give effect to this requirement, the sentencing judge in this case said:


""I am imposing an aggregate sentence. In my opinion each of these four offences is of similar seriousness and each would warrant, taking into account the discount for early plea, a sentence of four years imprisonment. There would have to be a degree of accumulation.""

57 With respect to the judge, this would appear to be doing little more than paying lip service to the requirement in s 53A(2)(b). I do not understand how the same sentence for each offence can be justified. True it is that they were offences of a similar (but not identical) nature and that the maximum penalty for each was the same. However, the judge was asked to take into account further offences when he sentenced for two of the offences; a reason in itself for the individual sentences to vary. ...""

55Hall J agreed with the reasons of both McClellan CJ at CL and RA Hulme J in that case.

56In reply the respondent accepted that it did not appear that the sentencing judge had taken the Form 1 matters into account, unless he had done so without making specific reference to them when fixing the aggregate sentence. The respondent submitted, however, that even if error of this kind had occurred, it did not necessarily follow that the aggregate sentence should be significantly different if this error were corrected.

57As the respondent properly conceded, the sentencing judge clearly erred by not taking the Form 1 offences into account. There were 19 of them and some were serious. This question was recently considered by a bench of five in the matters of Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115. There the Court emphasised the observations of Spigelman CJ in the guideline judgment at [42] where his Honour said in relation to matters on the Form 1:

""42 The position, in my opinion, is that although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. ...""

58In Abbas the Chief Justice, with whom Garling and Campbell JJ and I agreed, made it clear that within specified limitations a sentencing judge was to take into account the criminality associated with the Form 1 offences - [21] - [24]. See also my remarks at [102] - [106] with which Garling and Campbell JJ agreed.

59The effect of those decisions is that for the Form 1 offences in this matter to have been taken into account, the sentence for the offence in Sequence 1 would have had to be greater than those imposed for the offences in Sequences 2 and 3. By failing to properly take the Form 1 matters into account, his Honour was in error. This ground of appeal has been made out.

Crown Ground 3: The sentencing judge erred in his approach to setting the aggregate sentences.

60The appellant accepted that there was some overlap between this ground and Ground 2. It submitted that his Honour's approach to the imposition of aggregate sentences involved two discrete errors:

His Honour nominated the same individual sentence for each of the individual offences within the first aggregate sentence.

The aggregate sentences failed to reflect considerations of totality, i.e., the aggregate sentences effectively involved the imposition of wholly concurrent sentences.

61The appellant submitted that in addition to the error of failing to take into account the Form 1 matters, the sentencing judge erred in relation to the s112(2) and s112(1) matters because he had made them almost completely concurrent in circumstances where that was not appropriate. The appellant submitted that the reasons given by his Honour for adopting that course were inadequate. It submitted that it was apparent from his reasons in respect of the s112(2) offences that his Honour misunderstood s53A of the Sentencing Act and how aggregate sentencing operated. 

62The appellant submitted that the following observation by his Honour supported that submission:

""Because they were different offences to reflect the totality involved or total criminality involved may well have been that there would have been a need for cumulative sentences or partially cumulative in any event. I consider that the totality of the criminality would be reflected therefore in an aggregate sentence taking into account the Form 1 matters which I take into account in relation to such aggregate sentences which I sign and date today's date, once I find the Form 1."" (ROS 5.8)

63In relation to the s112(1) offences, the appellant submitted that the only explanation for almost complete concurrency in those four offences was the risk that to accumulate the sentences would have a crushing effect upon the respondent, so far as any chance of rehabilitation was concerned. The appellant submitted that his Honour appeared to think that the imposition of an aggregate sentence obviated a need to consider cumulation. If he did so, he was in error. 

64The appellant relied on R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130 at [38] where the Court (McClellan CJ at CL, RS Hulme and Hislop JJ) emphasised that concurrent sentences were not appropriate for multiple break and enter offences even where they were committed as part of a single spree of criminal behaviour. The Court affirmed that considerations of general and personal deterrence required that offenders be punished for each of their offences (see also R v Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255 at [38]). 

65The respondent accepted that the use of s53A of the Sentencing Act might operate to allow considerations of cumulation in penalties, but submitted that it did not preclude the need to also consider matters of concurrency. The respondent accepted that even though there was a strong argument in favour of a high level of concurrency, there would have to be some cumulation to recognise that separate offences were involved. The respondent submitted that even if error had been established, it did not follow that the aggregate sentence was manifestly inadequate.

66I agree with the Crown submission. His Honour did err in the way he approached cumulation and concurrency when applying the aggregate sentence provisions. This ground of appeal has been made out.

Crown Ground 4: The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the respondent's prior record of offending.

67The appellant submitted that the only reference by the sentencing judge to the respondent's criminal record was to note that it disentitled him to leniency. The appellant submitted that his Honour did not (apparently) take into account that many of the respondent's previous convictions were for similar offences to those for which he was being sentenced. The appellant submitted that his Honour did not take into account the increased need for the sentence to reflect considerations of personal deterrence and retribution because of the respondent's very lengthy history of similar offences.

68The respondent submitted that the absence of any further reference to the respondent's lengthy criminal record in three States, did not mean that the sentencing judge was unaware or absent minded as to that record. The respondent noted that in the sentencing hearing the Crown spent some time going through the detail of the respondent's criminal history (T.31.31).

69While it is not clear that the sentencing judge committed the error identified by the appellant, his treatment of the respondent's criminal record was cursory at best. The relevant principles are clear and were recently restated by Hall J (with whom Beazley JA and Harrison J agreed) in Van Der Baan v R [2012] NSWCCA 5 at [30]:

""30 ... 

(1) The principle of proportionality as enunciated in Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 requires that a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime, having regard to the objective circumstances: Hoare v The Queen [1989] HCA 33; (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354; McNaughton (supra) at 572 per Spigelman CJ at [15].


(2) The proportionality principle applies so that a sentence should not be less than the objective gravity of the offence required: McNaughton (supra) per Spigelman CJ.


(3) The antecedent criminal history of any offender may not be used to increase the sentence beyond what is an appropriate sentence for the particular offence: Baumer v The Queen [1988] HCA 67; (1988) 166 CLR 51 at 57. 


(4) Accordingly, prior convictions do not themselves play a role in determining the gravity of the offence which, as the High Court confirmed in Hoare (supra), turns on the objective circumstances of the offence: McNaughton (supra) at [24]:


""... the principle of proportionality requires the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence to be set by the objective circumstances of the offence, which circumstances do not encompass prior convictions.""

(5) Prior convictions are pertinent in terms as to where, within the boundaries set by the objective circumstances, a sentence should lie: McNaughton (supra) per Spigelman CJ at [26] (Bell J (as her Honour then was) and Hislop J agreeing). This proposition may be seen to be reflected in references in Veen (No 2) to concepts such as an ""attitude of disobedience to the law"" and to the increased weight to be given to retribution, to ""deterrence"" (relevantly personal deterrence) and ""the protection of society"".""

70In Regina v Brett Raymond Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109 Johnson J observed that it was incumbent upon judges to make clear the precise manner in which an offender's record has been taken into account:

""32 ... a passing reference to s21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, without reference to the precise manner in which the sentencing judge takes that factor into account on sentence, is unsatisfactory. A failure to explain the manner in which the factor is taken into account does not enlighten the sentencing process, in a manner which s21A appears to have been designed to achieve. ...""

71While it is not clear that his Honour erred in the way asserted by the appellant I do accept that his treatment of the respondent's criminal record was not satisfactory given its extent and the similarity between prior offending and the matters for which he was being sentenced. 

Crown Ground 5: The sentencing judge erred in failing to give effect to a finding of special circumstances.

72This was the same as the respondent's ground 1, which was:

""The sentencing judge erred in not giving effect to the finding of special circumstances for the total aggregate sentence.""

73The Crown submitted that despite the emphasis which his Honour placed on rehabilitation, in the finding of special circumstances, the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence in relation to the total effect of the sentences was 83 percent. This ground of appeal and the respondent's Ground of Appeal 1 have been made out.

74I accept that his Honour erred in failing to give effect to his finding of special circumstances (R v Kalache [2011] NSWCCA 210 at [37].) 

Crown Ground 6. The sentences, individually and as structured, are manifestly inadequate.

75In view of the errors already identified, it is not necessary to further examine this ground. The respondent will have to be re-sentenced so that this Court will have to make its own assessment of what sentences are appropriate.

Respondent's Ground 2: The sentence imposed for the deemed supply charge is in error as the objective criminality cannot be determined in the absence of any nominated quantity of the prohibited drug pseudoephedrine.

76The respondent submitted that although he had pleaded guilty to an offence of deemed supply, contrary to s25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), there was no evidence of the quantity of the prohibited drug in his possession. The only evidence related to the number of packets of pseudoephedrine based products of various brands, which had been sourced from different locations. The respondent submitted that as a result, it was not possible to assess the objective criminality of this offence. This was because an important factor in this kind of offence was the quantity of the prohibited drug that is possessed or supplied. The respondent submitted that in the absence of this important information, the severity of a sentence of 18 months, after a discount of 25 percent, was excessive and not justified by those limited facts.

77The appellant's response was that s31 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act concerned indictable offences, i.e. offences not involving a commercial quantity (in the case of pseudoephedrine 1.25 kg). An indictable quantity was 25g. The appellant submitted that the respondent by his plea of guilty admitted all the elements of the charge which included that the quantity of pseudoephedrine was between the minimum indictable quantity of 25g and the maximum of 1.25 kg at which point the quantity of pseudoephedrine became a commercial quantity. The appellant submitted that the Court could infer without further information that 110 packets of pseudoephedrine based tablets would produce a quantity of pseudoephedrine greater than 25g.

78In the event that the respondent was to be re-sentenced, the appellant relied on an affidavit of Ms Williams, sworn 22 May 2013, to which was annexed a statement of Detective Inspector Iorfino. This statement was to the effect that the total amount of pure pseudoephedrine that could be extracted from 110 packets of tablets was 113.06g, which could be used to manufacture approximately 791.3g of methylamphetamine.

79Since it was common ground that the respondent would have to be re-sentenced, the Crown is entitled to rely upon that affidavit. To the extent that there was any doubt on the issue, the content of the affidavit dispose of the point taken by the respondent.

80What emerges from the Agreed Facts is that the respondent was engaged in the systematic, illegal acquisition of pseudoephedrine for the purpose of supplying it to someone else to be used in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. To that extent, therefore, the respondent was an active participant in a drug supply network. In those circumstances, the low sentence imposed for this offence by reference to the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years cannot be regarded as excessive. This is particularly so in the light of the respondent's poor subjective case.

81This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Respondent's Ground 3: The overall sentence imposed was too severe in all the circumstances of the offences, for reasons including:
The sentences for three use false instrument charges were each excessive, and
The delayed commencement of the sentence on 16th January 2012.

82The respondent submitted that the head sentences for the three ""use false instrument"" charges were excessive. He noted that the sentencing judge had consistently referred to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act in relation to those offences, whereas the offences were contrary to s254(b)(i) of the Crimes Act. The respondent submitted that his Honour may well have had a different level of criminality in mind when imposing sentence.

83The respondent submitted that because these offences involved only one packet of medication containing pseudoephedrine for which the purchase price was paid, the level of criminality was low. The respondent submitted that as a result, a non-custodial sentence should have been imposed. Alternatively, the terms of imprisonment should have been no more than one - two months in length.

84In relation to the start date for the sentences, the respondent submitted that his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that he had been in custody since 2 December 2010 and that this was a relevant matter when applying the principle of totality. The respondent submitted that it was excessively harsh to totally cumulate the sentences presently under consideration on top of the pre-sentence custody relating to the driving offences.

85The respondent's submission misunderstands why his Honour referred to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. His references to that Act were to explain that the property obtained by the appellant was a prohibited drug, pursuant to that Act. This was relevant because it explained why the appellant had used a false driver's licence to purchase cold and flu tablets. His Honour's references to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act were appropriate and not indicative of error.

86While it is true that the ""use false instrument"" charges related to the purchase of only one packet of medication on each occasion, the submission fails to address the purpose for which the pseudoephedrine was fraudulently obtained, i.e. to manufacture methylamphetamine. Moreover, restrictions on the sale of pseudoephedrine based products meant that the appellant could not purchase more than one packet at a time.

87These offences were planned and were part of an extended criminal purpose in that they were to be on-sold for the purpose of manufacturing a prohibited drug. The offences were committed over an extended period of time and were motivated by commercial gain. Finally, the sentences imposed for these matters were totally concurrent with the sentences for other matters. Other than their presence on the appellant's criminal record, no additional punishment was exacted for them. 

88In relation to backdating the commencement date for the sentences, this is a matter very much within the discretion of the sentencing judge. His Honour was aware that when the appellant was sentenced for the driving offences, it was known by the sentencing court that he had been in custody since 2 December 2010 and that is why the commencement date for those sentences was backdated to that date.

89Accordingly, his Honour did not err in declining to backdate the commencement of the sentences which he imposed. It would have been of assistance if his Honour had given reasons why he did not do so because such imprisonment can be relevant to totality. Nevertheless, the failure to give reasons on the facts of this case did not amount to error. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Re-sentence

90Because of the errors identified, both in the Crown appeal and in the appeal by the respondent, it will be necessary to re-sentence the respondent.

91The seriousness of the errors identified in the Crown appeal is such that it is inevitable that the sentences to be imposed on the respondent should be increased. That having been said, it will also be necessary to give appropriate effect in that re-sentencing exercise to the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge. The overall effect of the sentences which I propose is a head sentence of 7 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 5 years.

92The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) Crown appeal allowed.

(2) Leave to appeal is granted to the respondent but the appeal is dismissed.

(3) The sentences imposed by Puckeridge ADCJ on 14 September 2012 are quashed.

(4) In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced as follows:

(i) For the offence of supply a prohibited drug contrary to s25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months, commencing 16 July 2011 and expiring 15 July 2012.

(ii) For the offence of break enter and steal, contrary to s112(1) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 7 Harbord Pharmacy) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing 16 October 2011 and expiring 15 October 2013, with a balance of term of 1 year, expiring 15 October 2014.

(iii) For the offence of break enter and steal, contrary to s112(1) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 13 Merrylands) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing 16 January 2012 and expiring 15 January 2014, with a balance of term of 1 year expiring 15 January 2015.

(iv) For the offence of break enter and steal, contrary to s112(1) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 22 Mulgoa Pharmacy) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing 16 April 2012 and expiring 15 April 2014 with a balance of term of 1 year, expiring 15 April 2015.

(v) For the offence of break enter and steal, contrary to s112(1) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 25 Werrington) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing 16 July 2012 and expiring 15 July 2014, with a balance of term of 1 year, expiring 15 July 2015.

(vi) For the offence of aggravated break enter and steal, contrary to s112(2) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 2 Caringbah Chemist) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, commencing 16 January 2013 and expiring 15 July 2015, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months expiring 15 January 2017.

(vii) For the offence of attempt aggravated break enter and steal, contrary to s112(2) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 3 Miranda) imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, commencing 16 April 2013 and expiring 15 October 2015, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months expiring 15 April 2017.

(viii) For the offence of aggravated break enter and steal, contrary to s112(2) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 1 Carrs Park Chemist) to which the Form 1 matters are attached, imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing 16 July 2013 and expiring 15 July 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months, expiring 15 October 2018.

(ix) For the offence of attempt to use false instrument, contrary to s254(b)(i) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 9 Claremont Meadows) imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing 16 April 2012 and expiring 15 April 2013.

(x) For the offence of use false instrument, contrary to s254(b)(i) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 6 Plumpton) imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months, commencing 16 April 2013 and expiring 15 April 2014.

(xi) For the offence of use false instrument, contrary to s254(b)(i) Crimes Act 1900 (Sequence 27 Plumpton) imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months, commencing 16 April 2014 and expiring 15 April 2015.

93FULLERTON J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

94McCALLUM J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		26 June 2013",2013-06-25 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706553,Delaney v R; R v Delaney [2013] NSWCCA 150,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  There are two proceedings before the Court.  The appellant has appealed against his conviction and the Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against sentence, pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
2The appellant was arraigned on an indictment that contained four counts:
Count 1:  On 3 May 2010 at Raymond Terrace in the State of New South Wales in the company of other persons with menaces demanded from Neil Metcraft money with intent to steal that property from Neil Metcraft, contrary to s99(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 14 years.
Count 2:  On 4 May 2010 at Raymond Terrace in the State of New South Wales in the company of another person with menaces demanded from Neil Metcraft money with intent to steal that property from Neil Metcraft contrary to s99(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.
Count 3:  On 4 May 2010 at Raymond Terrace in the State of New South Wales did receive proceeds of a crime, being money, in circumstances where he knew the said money was proceeds of crime, contrary to s193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty was 15 years imprisonment.
Count 4:  On 13 May 2010 at Raymond Terrace in the State of New South Wales did with menaces demand from Neil Metcraft money with intent to steal that property from Neil Metcraft, contrary to s99(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty was 10 years imprisonment.
3The appellant pleaded not guilty to each count and the trial proceeded by judge alone before his Honour Judge Charteris.  On 31 October 2012 his Honour found the appellant guilty on all four counts in the indictment.
4On 14 December 2012 his Honour sentenced the appellant as follows:
Counts 1, 2 and 3:  Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 months commencing 1 September 2012 and expiring 30 June 2013, with an additional period of 14 months expiring 31 August 2014.
Count 4:  Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 months commencing 1 September 2012 and expiring 30 June 2013, with an additional period of 8 months expiring 28 February 2014.
CONVICTION APPEAL
5The appellant relies upon the following Grounds of Appeal:
Ground 1:  The verdicts of the trial judge with respect to Counts 2 and 4 are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.
Ground 2:  The inclusion of count 3 on the indictment was an abuse of process and has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
Factual background
6In April or May 2010 the victim opened ""Ink Expressions Tattoo"" at Raymond Terrace.  On 3 May 2010 the appellant, a co-offender Julian Ivory, and a third unknown male from the Rebels Motorcycle Club, attended the newly opened tattoo shop.  The appellant told the victim that he had ""no right to open a tattoo shop here"".  The appellant stood just inches from the victim's face and said to him ""Do you know who we are?  I'm a tattooist.  You have opened a shop where I was going to open a shop.  You have no right.  We can close you down and blow your shop up.  You can pay $200 a week.  If you don't, we'll run you out of town"".  The victim said that he saw some type of metal object, a silver or shiny object, in the right sleeve of the right arm of the appellant.  The co-offender, Ivory, told the victim that they would call him and he would have to come and meet them (Count 1).  
7No payment was made by the victim on 3 May 2010.  On the following day, he received a call from the co-offender, Ivory.  He was told to go to the skate park, which he did, taking an envelope containing $200 with him.  He was at the skate park for five minutes when he received a call from his wife telling him to go back to the shop.  Back at the shop he received a telephone call from Julian Ivory who told him to go to McDonalds at Heatherbrae.  The victim drove there and parked in the McDonald's carpark.  After three minutes, he saw a Harley Davidson motorcycle arrive with two people on it.  The victim recognised the two people as Julian Ivory and the appellant.  They were each wearing leather vests with the words ""Rebels Motorcycle Club"" upon them.  
8The appellant said to the victim ""You shouldn't have opened the shop in Raymond Terrace"".  He pointed to his Rebels Motorcycle Club patch and said ""We run this area, we run this town"".  The victim had no further conversation with the appellant.  The victim handed the money to Julian Ivory who told him ""Next time put it in an envelope"".  Julian Ivory nominated an amount of $200 per week and asked the victim what day was suitable to collect the money.  The victim nominated Thursdays.  The appellant did not speak, he was sitting on the motorcycle about a metre away.  The victim wrote down Mr Ivory's telephone number and returned to his shop (counts 2 and 3).
9The next day, 5 May 2010, the victim spoke to the police at Raymond Terrace.
10On 13 May 2010 a person arrived at the tattoo shop and said to the victim ""Have you got this week's money?""  He gave the man $200 which was in an envelope.  Five minutes later, someone else arrived.  It was a person he had not seen before who said to him ""I'm Joe, I'm here to pick up the protection money"".  At the time the person who had collected the envelope just minutes before was also with him.  The victim said to ""Joe"" (who his Honour was satisfied was Joseph Connell) ""I've already paid"".  Joe said to him ""Don't pay him, pay us.  He has no right to pick up the money.  We'll fix him"" (count 4).
11The victim continued to make weekly payments until September 2010.
Findings by trial judge
12The primary judge found that the victim gave an honest and accurate account of what had occurred on 3 and 4 May and was a ""very reliable witness"" on the essential elements of the offences.  He rejected the appellant's evidence that he was not one of the three persons who entered the tattoo shop on 3 May 2010.  
13Specifically his Honour found:
""I reject the accused's account of what had occurred on 3 and 4 May 2010.  I utilise the evidence of the actions of the victim, as well as of persons said to be members of the Rebels Motorcycle Club who have been identified in evidence.  I comfortably find beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Delaney was one of the prime movers and negotiators of the joint criminal enterprise which commenced on 3 May 2010 and continued until the apprehension of Mr Connell and Mr Voss on 7 September 2010.  I accept that Mr Connell did tell the victim that he was collecting on behalf of the accused.  I am satisfied that although the accused was not in the Raymond Terrace area at certain periods agreed by the parties, there is no evidence whatsoever that this accused withdrew from the joint criminal enterprise that he had negotiated on 3 and 4 May 2010.""  (Judgment 41)
Ground 1:  The verdicts of the trial judge with respect to Counts 2 and 4 are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.
14Counts 2 and 4 relied upon the following provision of the Crimes Act 1900:
""99 Demanding property with intent to steal
(1)   Whosoever, with menaces, or by force, demands any property from any person, with intent to steal the same, shall be liable to imprisonment for ten years.
(2)   A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in the company of another person or persons. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.
(3)   It is immaterial whether any such menace is of violence or injury by the offender or by any other person.""
15In relation to count 2, the appellant submitted that although the appellant and Mr Ivory were present at the McDonald's carpark on 4 May 2010 and payment was made at that time by the victim of $200 to Mr Ivory, there was no demand or threat made by the appellant or Mr Ivory to the victim on that day.
16In relation to count 4, the appellant noted that the Crown case was that he did not attend on this occasion (13 May 2010), but that two other members of the Rebels Motorcycle Club, did so.  It was the Crown case that the principles of joint criminal enterprise applied and provided a basis for the liability of the appellant.  The appellant submitted that there was no evidence of any threats or demands made by the men who attended the victim's shop to collect the payment of $200 on that date.
17The appellant did not challenge the primary judge's findings with respect to count 1, i.e., that on 3 May he in the company of other persons with menaces demanded money from the victim with intent to steal that money.  The appellant submitted, however, that there was no basis in law for the proposition that, on every subsequent occasion that the victim paid money to the appellant, or to some other member of the Rebels Motorcycle Club, a further offence contrary to s99 was committed.  This was because on subsequent occasions the appellant was not present and on 4 and 13 May 2010 there were no demands accompanied by menaces.  The appellant submitted that the demand accompanied by menaces was made on 3 May 2010 at which time the offence was complete.
18In support of that proposition, the appellant relied upon Austin v R [1989] HCA 26; 166 CLR 669 at 675 where the Court observed:
""But where the definition of an offence can be construed either to include or to omit the consequences of the offender's act as an element of the offence, the immediacy of the consequences and their subjection to supervening events or actions are material to the construction to be placed upon the definition. Thus it is appropriate to regard the offence of demanding money with menaces or threats as complete when the demand has been made in circumstances apt to achieve its communication to the person to whom it is directed and with the necessary intent.""  (Emphasis added)
19The appellant submitted that for further offences, contrary to s99 of the Crimes Act 1900 to occur, further demands with menaces or threats had to be made.  He submitted that there was no evidence that this had occurred.  The appellant submitted that the only occasion when all of the elements of an offence, contrary to s99 had been made out, was 3 May 2010.  The appellant accepted that the regular receipt of money from the victim consequent upon the conduct on 3 May 2010 may have constituted discrete criminal offences, e.g. receiving the proceeds of crime pursuant to s193B of the Crimes Act 1900, but they did not constitute offences contrary to s99.
20This ground of appeal should be rejected.  In support of the ground the appellant relied upon the analysis of Wood CJ at CL (with whom Beazley JA and Dunford J agreed) in Rae v R (1998) 45 NSWLR 546 at 554.  Contrary to the submission by the appellant, I regard that case as supporting the position adopted by the Crown at trial, i.e., that a specific threat does not have to be articulated if the circumstances of the case make it clear that a threat exists.  The facts in Rae involved a telephone call advising that a bomb had been placed in a Woolworths store.  The particular offence under consideration was ""use of a telecommunication service ... to menace"".  In Rae there was no threat other than the communication of the fact that a bomb had been placed in the Woolworths store.
21In those circumstances, Wood CJ at CL said:
""I am of the view that, within the ordinary usage of language, the use of a telephone service to communicate advice of this nature constitutes a use of that service to menace the intended recipient or recipients of that message.
I am not persuaded that the objective test favoured by Hidden J inL J Holland is inappropriate. It accords with ordinary usage; indeed it is difficult to conceive of anything more likely to engender fear of serious physical injury than a bomb call. Inevitably such a call leads to the immediate evacuation of the building or area believed to be affected. Often it occasions panic, because the  consequences of a bomb exploding in areas occupied bycivilians are well-known.
I do not consider it necessary that the call convey the threat that actual physical harm will occur to any particular person or persons, although in this case that would have been a probable consequence if a bomb did exist that was not found before it exploded.
It is my view that if a person of normal stability and courage, in the place of the intended recipient, might be made apprehensive as to his safety or well- being, by a message conveyed by the use of a telephone service, then the service can properly be held to have been used for the offending purpose.""
22A similar situation arose in R v Collister (1955) 39 Cr App R 100.  The offenders in that case were young police officers of the Metropolitan Police Force.  The victim gave evidence that on a particular evening he was approached by Collister who told him that he was on leave from the merchant navy and that he was broke.  The victim suggested that Collister should come back to his hotel for the purpose of arranging the night's lodging.  As they were walking towards the hotel, Collister produced a police warrant and said ""I'm going to arrest you on a charge of importuning"".  They were then joined by the co-offender, who was introduced as a police sergeant.  Collister said, ""This man invited me to come to his hotel.  I'm satisfied that he is importuning"".  The victim protested against this suggestion but he was told ""this is going to look very bad for you"".  The victim had the impression that both men were endeavouring to obtain money from him.  Because he had little money on him at the time, he suggested that they meet the following night at 7pm.
23The victim reported the matter to the police and acting on their instructions, kept the appointment with the offenders the following evening.  When they met, one of the offenders asked him if he had brought anything with him and the victim handed over five pounds.  The offenders were then arrested.
24The offenders were charged with demanding money by menaces.  One of the grounds of appeal was that neither a demand nor a menace had been proved by the prosecution.  The Court held that on such a charge an actual explicit demand, either express or by unequivocal gesture, was not an essential ingredient of the offence nor need the menaces be expressed.  The Court held that in circumstances where there had been no such express demand or threat, if the demeanour of the offender and the circumstances of the case were such that an ordinary reasonable person would understand a demand for money was being made and that demand was accompanied by menaces, whether direct or veiled, so that the balance of an ordinary mind would be likely to be upset, the elements of the offence were established.
25In this case the demands of 3 May were clear, as was the threat.  The contrary has not been submitted.  The subsequent telephone call and communications on 4 May made it clear that the threat communicated on 3 May was continuing, and it was in those circumstances that the victim handed over the $200.  Just as in Collister, the Crown did not have to prove an express demand with menaces on 4 May.  The circumstances of the meeting on 4 May are to be looked at in the context of the appellant's attendance at the victim's premises the day before.  Those circumstances were such that an ordinary reasonable person would understand that the demand for money was being made on 4 May and that the consequences of not paying that money were those which had been communicated on 3 May.
26With respect to count 4, it was Mr Connell who attended with Mr Voss on 13 May.  The opening comment of the other man ""Have you got this week's money"" and the comment by Mr Connell ""I'm Joe, I'm here to pick up the protection money"" were clear demands for the $200 amount specified on 3 May.  When learning that the money had been paid to another person, the further comment of ""Don't pay him, pay us"" operated as a reinforcement of whom the recipients would be of the $200 with the implied consequences for disobedience being those communicated to the victim on 3 May.
27In the context of what had occurred on 3 May with the demand for $200 and the specification of the consequences for not paying, the circumstances of the meeting on 13 May were such that an ordinary person would understand that the demand for $200 was being made and that the failure to make the payment would produce the consequences previously communicated.
28The quotation from Austin does not assist the appellant.  The issue in Austin was that for the offence to be made out, there was no need for there to be an actual payment.  The offence was complete when the demand had been made.  The Court held at [12] that it was appropriate to regard the offence of demanding money with menaces or threats as complete where the demand had been made in circumstances apt to achieve its communication to the person to whom it was directed and with the necessary intent.  It was not necessary to regard actual communication as a necessary part of the offence.  
29It is significant that the appellant was unable to identify any authority directly in point to support the submission in Ground 1.
30This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2:  The inclusion of count 3 on the indictment was an abuse of process and has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
31The charge in count 3 was brought pursuant to s193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.  That section relevantly provided:
""193B Money Laundering...
(2)   A person who deals with proceeds of crime knowing that it is proceeds of crime is guilty of an offence. ""
32The appellant submitted that the facts relied upon by the Crown in relation to count 3 were the same as those relied on with respect to count 2.
33In support of that submission, the appellant relied upon Nahlous v R [2010] NSWCCA 58; 77 NSWLR 463.  There the Court (McClellan CJ at CL; Howie and Rothman JJ) considered a circumstance where an offender had been charged with offences contrary to s135ASB(1) and s135ASC(1) of the Copyright Act 1968 concerning the sale of and offering to sell unauthorised television decoders.  He was also charged under s400.6(1) of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995 with an offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime.  For every offence contrary to the Copyright Act where a sale was made, the offender was also charged with an offence under s400.6(1) of the Code.
34The Court considered the use of s400.6(1) to be an abuse of process in those circumstances:
""14 In Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294 this Court raised concerns about the use of the section in the circumstances of a person who was engaged in taxation fraud.  As well as being charged with the actual fraudulent conduct, he was also charged with an offence involving dealing with the money obtained by the frauds. In that case the activity was merely accessing the funds that he had derived from the frauds.  The sentencing judge in that case failed to appreciate the nature of the criminal activity involved in what was called ""the money laundering offence"" and sentenced the applicant to an excessive sentence for that offence.  As in the case now before the Court, the offence to a certain extent concerned the profits of the applicant's own criminality and resulted in a miscarriage of justice. However, unlike the present case, there was some justification for the money laundering offence because it captured criminality of the applicant's co-offender, who had never been charged and yet was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with the applicant.  
15  In Thorn Howie J, who delivered the principal judgment of the Court, stated at [27]: 
""This was an unusual use of a money laundering offence. To the extent that there was an overlap with the fraud offences the charge represented the use of the funds that had been dishonestly obtained under those offences. The criminality was very much in the obtaining of the funds not in their use. It is somewhat analogous to a robber being sentenced for both the robbery and being in possession of the stolen goods.  But in the present case, according to the maximum penalties prescribed, the money laundering offence was more serious than the frauds by which the money was obtained.  Further the money laundering charge was used to punish the applicant for his criminality arising from his partner's fraudulent conduct.  As was noted earlier, there is no concept of a joint criminal enterprise under the Code, so the applicant could not be charged with his partner's fraudulent activity even though it was common activity of them both.""
16  In the present case we can see no justification whatever for the applicant being charged with the Code offence. In relation to the 50 decoders the criminality was in the sale as a result of which the owners of the services were deprived of their financial entitlement to rental charges for their use. The concept of a ""sale"" necessarily involves the seller obtaining some financial gain from the transaction. The receipt of the money was merely an element of the offence under s135ASB(1).
17  We appreciate that a person can by the one act commit two offences and, where the two offences address different aspects of the criminal conduct, there is nothing wrong with prosecuting the two offences or, subject to the principle of totality, with imposing separate sentences for the two offences.  But in our view the receipt of the money as a result of the sale did not result in a separate act of criminality that warranted a separate charge and a separate penalty.  We do not believe that there is anything in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 that conflicts with the view that we have taken as to the inappropriateness of the prosecution of the Code offence as well as the decoder offence; see particularly at [31].   We believe that in the circumstances of this case it was oppressive to charge the applicant with both the sale of the decoders and the receipt of the money as a result of the sale.  That is because in our view the offence of sale encompassed the criminality of possessing the proceeds of the sale.""
35The appellant submitted that on the facts of this case, there was no proper basis for count 3.  He submitted that the receipt of the money, as a result of the alleged commission of a further s99(2) offence (count 2) did not result in a separate act of criminality that warranted a separate charge and a separate penalty.  He submitted that even if it were open to the Crown to charge him with a s99 Crimes Act offence for the events of 4 May 2010, it was an abuse of process to also prosecute him for a breach of s193B(2) on the same facts.
36The simple answer to this ground of appeal is that the elements of offences contrary to s99(2) and s193B(2) of the Crimes Act are different.  Neither offence is wholly included in the other.  Each of the offences requires proof of a fact which the other did not.  In the case of the s99(2) offence, there is the element of the demand with menaces, and in the s193B(2) offence there is the dealing with the proceeds of crime.
37This issue was dealt with in Pearce.  There the offences under consideration involved conduct contrary to sections 33 and 110 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  Section 33 referred to maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so and s110 referred to breaking and entering a dwelling house and while therein inflicting grievous bodily harm.  The appellant in Pearce had been convicted of both offences which had arisen out of a single episode.  In relation to whether the  bringing of those two counts constituted an abuse of process, the plurality (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ) said:
""7 The elements of the offences charged against the appellant overlap but they are not identical. The offence under s33 requires a specific intent to do grievous bodily harm; the offence under s110 does not. The latter section requires only an intention to do the acts that caused the harm. The offence under s110 requires a breaking and entering; the offence under s33 does not. Did charging both offences subject the appellant to double jeopardy?
...
31 There was, however, no abuse of process in charging this appellant with both counts 9 and 10. The short answer to the contention that the charging of both counts was an abuse of process is that because the offences are different (and different in important respects) the laying of both charges could not be said to be vexatious or oppressive or for some improper or ulterior purpose. To hold otherwise would be to preclude the laying of charges that, together, reflect the whole criminality of the accused and, consonant with what was held in R v De Simoni, would require the accused to be sentenced only for the offence or offences charged, excluding consideration of any part of the accused's conduct that could have been charged separately.""
38This is sufficient to deal with the ground of appeal.  There are, however, other consequences which flow from the overlap between the offending in counts 2 and 3 when sentencing is considered.
39This ground of appeal has not been made out.
CROWN SENTENCE APPEAL
40The factual background to the offending has already been set out.
41In his remarks on sentence, the primary judge took into account the appellant's subjective circumstances.  He was born in November 1964 and was aged 48 at the time of sentencing.  He was born in Sydney, the middle child of a family of three.  When he was aged 10 his parents split up.  He described his father as ""scary"" and said that he was abusive to everyone.  He remained with his mother at the time of separation.  She commenced a new relationship with a person named ""John"" whom the appellant described as being cruel and physically abusive to him.  That abuse included him being thrown against a wall.  At the age of 11, he was ordered out of the home.  Shortly after, he joined Ashtons Circus.  His mother eventually left ""John"", but the appellant has had little contact with her.  He said that his biological father is now retired and he sees him from time to time.
42The appellant commenced working as a tattoo artist at the age of 11.  At the age of 19 he opened his own shop in Newcastle.  He closed the tattoo shop when he was given the sole custody of his two daughters.  This occurred approximately 7 years ago.  At the time his daughters were aged 8 weeks and 12 months.  His personal relationship history has been dysfunctional and the two partnerships he has had have both broken down.
43In relation to his criminal record, the primary judge noted that ""it was not a bad one"".  There had been some convictions when he was aged 20, but thereafter there had been no convictions until a low-range PCA offence in 2002.  In June 2005 he was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was sentenced to 80 hours community service.
44His criminal record was complicated by the fact that in May 2010 he was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company.  That related to an incident which occurred after these offences, but which was related to them.  The circumstances were that a Mr Stolzenberg (who was the person who had ""impermissibly"" demanded $200 from the victim on 13 May), was severely beaten by Mr Ivory as punishment for that action.  The appellant was present but did not actively participate.  He was sentenced by Judge Frearson to 128 days in prison. That sentence had expired by the time the appellant was sentenced for these offences.
45The appellant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings, but had given evidence at trial.  A psychologist's report was tendered on his behalf.  By reference to the appellant's evidence at trial, and the contents of that report, his Honour concluded that the appellant was a loving father to his two daughters and that he had fully honoured his responsibilities to them as a father.  The appellant had seen the psychologist, Ms Robilliard, on three occasions, at the commencement of trial, after verdict and while in prison.  She had observed that the appellant had become very depressed, particularly at the prospect of not being able to care and provide for his two young daughters.  They are now aged 6 and 7.  
46The psychologist recorded her observations of the appellant interacting with his daughters and his Honour accepted that evidence.  She observed that he treated the children appropriately and affectionately.  She was particularly impressed by the politeness of the children.  His Honour accepted that the appellant was genuinely worried about the welfare of the children who were now living with their mother.
47The psychologist recorded how the appellant had become a member of the Rebels Motorcycle Club.  This had occurred almost inadvertently because much of his tattoo work was done for club members.  They had not paid for the tattoo work.  At the time of the offending, he had been a member of the club for a couple of years.
48His Honour accepted the conclusions of the psychologist, which were that the appellant genuinely regretted his involvement with the Rebels Motorcycle Club.  He had a long history of a complex post traumatic stress disorder from his childhood.  She concluded that a psychiatric assessment would be of benefit to him.  She thought that now that he had left the Rebels Motorcycle Club his chances of re-offending were significantly reduced.
49His Honour noted in relation to the seriousness of the charges that although only $400 had been extorted from the victim the evidence satisfied him that other club members had continued to take ""protection money"" from the victim.  While his Honour accepted that the appellant was not linked to that conduct, he noted that after the extortion had commenced, others chose to take advantage of it.  Nevertheless, his Honour was mindful that he must only punish the appellant for the conduct reflected in the indictment and not for what other persons did after 13 May 2012.
50His Honour found special circumstances; being the need for rehabilitation and the care required by his two daughters.  His Honour was not prepared to find exceptional circumstances in relation to the care of the children.  His Honour was, however, concerned that the current arrangements for the children were not particularly satisfactory.  His Honour noted that he had seen their mother give evidence and was concerned that she might be somewhat unreliable, if not unstable, on occasions.  In that regard, the mother had had nine children and in recent times had experienced periods of homelessness.  She was already looking after two other children.  
51His Honour found that the motivation for the offending was financial gain, although in that regard, under the club rules, the appellant was subservient to Mr Ivory.  
52His Honour concluded that in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3 a sentence of 2 years was appropriate.  He considered that this sentence should be served concurrently since the conduct took place over three separate days, over a period of 10 days between 3 and 13 May.  In reaching that conclusion he took into account the maximum penalty, the length of time the conduct took place and the appellant's role in it.
53In fixing a minimum term of 10 months, his Honour was particularly concerned with the welfare of the appellant's children.  He selected 1 September 2012 as the commencement date of the sentence.  He did so because the appellant had been on bail for 2 years and reported to police every day, i.e. in excess of 700 occasions.  His Honour noted that while this could never amount to fulltime custody, it did involve a significant restriction on the appellant's liberty.
54His Honour also had regard to considerations of parity, particularly in relation to Mr Ivory, who had been more significantly involved in the offending but who had received a comparatively light sentence.
Ground 1:  His Honour failed to determine the objective criminality of the offences.
55The Crown submitted that this was a fundamental part of the sentencing process which his Honour had failed to carry out.  The Crown submitted that the offending was a serious example of criminality of this kind because it was premeditated, ongoing and seriously undermined the civil rights of the victim.
56While it is true that his Honour did not in terms assess the objective gravity of the offending, he did specifically refer to the factors which bore upon its objective seriousness. His Honour took account of the amount involved, the role of the appellant, the nature of the conduct and the period over which it took place.   While it may have been preferable for his Honour to have made a specific assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, he did implicitly do so.  I am satisfied that the factors to which his Honour referred were relevant and important and were given proper weight in the sentencing process.  While his Honour may not have expressly determined the objective criminality of the offences, he clearly took that into account. 
57It is well established that a sentencing judge's characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is an evaluative judgment with which the Court will not interfere unless the finding was not open.  The sentencing judge here had the benefit of hearing all of the evidence at the trial and seeing the appellant give evidence.  While it is true that his Honour gave considerable weight to the appellant's subjective case, this was an approach well open to him, given the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case.
58This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2:  The dating of the sentences.
Ground 3:  His Honour's failure to accumulate.
Ground 4:  His Honour did not have regard to ""matters of parity"".
Ground 5:  His Honour's failure to have regard to the respondent's role.
Ground 6:  His Honour's failure to have regard to the aggravating features.
Ground 7:  The weight his Honour afforded to the respondent's subjective case has impermissibly ameliorated the appropriate sentence.
Ground 8:  His Honour's failure to acknowledge the significance of general deterrence.
Ground 9:  The sentences are individually and as aggregated manifestly inadequate.
59It is convenient to deal with all of these grounds of appeal together, since they essentially raise the same issue, i.e. manifest inadequacy by reference to the particular factors set out in the Grounds of Appeal.  
Ground 2:
60The commencement date for a sentence has always been a matter of discretion for the sentencing judge.  If appropriate reasons have been given, it is necessary for a party challenging that decision to identify a House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 error if the challenge is to be successful.
61In fixing the commencement date at 1 September 2012, his Honour had regard to the appellant's bail conditions with which he had complied for over two years.  His Honour also had regard to the period of imprisonment imposed by Frearson DCJ which commenced 2 August 2012 and concluded 7 December 2012.  The offence, for which he was sentenced by Frearson DCJ, while different to these offences, was directly related to them.
62These were matters which his Honour could properly take into account (R v Anderson [2012] NSWCCA 175 at [41] - [45]).  Accordingly, the Crown has failed to establish that his Honour's exercise of discretion miscarried in this respect.
Ground 3:  
63The Crown submitted that because four offences were involved, there should have been some accumulation of sentences and his Honour's failure to do so constituted error.  In support of that proposition, the Crown relied upon the statement of principle by Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]:
""27 In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality.  Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.""
64The statement of principle by Howie J in Cahyadi does not support the Crown submission.  There was a considerable overlap in relation to all four offences.  Counts 2 - 4 were inextricably linked to count 1.  The offences can be readily characterised as a course of conduct.  They were committed within a short period of time, had a number of common features and were a consequence of the first offence.  The appellant was not present when count 4 occurred.
65Significantly, the Crown made no submission during the sentencing proceedings to the effect that his Honour was bound to accumulate or that he would fall into error by imposing concurrent sentences.  Moreover, Robison DCJ imposed concurrent sentences when sentencing Mr Ivory for the same offences on 3 May 2010 and on 4 May 2010.
66There is an added difficulty which was not raised by either party in submissions but needs to be kept in mind.  In Pearce the plurality said 623:
""40 To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn.  Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means that offences overlap.  To punish an offender twice if conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts.""
67As indicated, there was a substantial overlap in relation to all of the offences.  It was the appellant's initial participation in the demand with menaces which was an element in all of the subsequent offences.  This is particularly so in relation to count 3.  In the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, I am not persuaded that error of the kind contended for by the Crown has been made out.
Ground 4:  
68The Crown submitted that by reference to the sentence imposed on Mr Ivory by Robison DCJ, it was clear that the appellant's sentence was out of proportion and inadequate in that the punishment for the same offending was not equal.  The Crown submitted that as a result the parity principle had been offended.
69This submission is misconceived.  The parity principle is one of amelioration designed to benefit offenders.  It was not developed as a means by which the Crown could have sentences increased.  It is for this reason that seminal cases such as Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 express the parity principle as follows:
""3 ... It may be said that the very existence of the disparity reveals that an error must have been committed, but I would prefer frankly to acknowledge that the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done.  ..."" (Gibbs CJ at 610, see also Mason J at 612, Wilson J at 616 and Dawson J at 623.)
70In any event, the submission does not accurately reflect the basis upon which Mr Ivory was sentenced.  The most serious charge to which he pleaded was wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.  That charge related to the beating which he gave to Mr Stolzenberg.  The sentence imposed by Robison DCJ in respect of the two counts of demand money with menaces was almost entirely concurrent with the sentence for the more serious offence.  The effective period, which Mr Ivory was required to serve for the offences committed with the respondent, was 3 months.
71This ground has not been made out.
Ground 5:
72The Crown submitted that there was an unresolved conflict between the finding by his Honour in his conviction judgment that the appellant was ""one of the prime movers and negotiators of the joint criminal enterprise that commenced on 3 May"" and the finding in the remarks on sentence:
""I accept the club rules were that, as a member of the club, Mr Delaney was subservient to Mr Julian Ivory.  Mr Ivory's conduct with Mr Metcalf confirmed that.""  (ROS 19)
73The conflict in those findings is more apparent than real.  The fact that the appellant played a significant role with Mr Ivory in the events of 3 May is not inconsistent with him acting under the direction of Mr Ivory at the time, and within the club structure being in a subservient position to Mr Ivory.
74What is important is that after 3 May, the appellant played little or no part in the offending.  Put at its highest, his remarks to the victim on 4 May can be seen as reinforcing the statements made on 3 May, but they did not constitute fresh threats.
75This ground needs to be considered against his Honour's finding in the remarks on sentence that the appellant had ""comparatively recently joined the Rebels Motorcycle Group and was very recently made a full member"" and that the co-offender, Mr Ivory, was the sergeant-at-arms for the Newcastle Chapter of the  Rebels Motorcycle Club with responsibility for discipline (ROS 3).
76This ground has not been made out.
Ground 6:
77The Crown submitted that his Honour referred in passing to aggravating features without specifically taking them into account and without giving any real consideration to how those aggravating features impacted on the seriousness of the offending.
78The only aggravating feature identified by the sentencing judge and by the Crown to support that submission was his Honour's finding that the demand by the appellant and his co-offenders was part of ""organised criminal behaviour"".  His Honour also found that ""his membership of the club has resulted in his engaging in the serious criminal activity of extortion"" (ROS 18).  His Honour clearly identified this aggravating feature of the offending and it is implicit in his Honour's reference to that factor, that he took it into account when sentencing.  This ground has not been made out.
Ground 7:  
79The Crown submitted that his children's circumstances did not amount to ""exceptional circumstances"" as required by such cases as R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510 at 516.  The Crown submitted that even allowing for the need for rehabilitation, the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence was excessively lenient (i.e. 45 percent) which was indicative of error.
80The appellant's need for rehabilitation was conceded by the Crown in the sentence proceedings.  His Honour rejected the appellant's submission that the situation relating to his daughters amounted to exceptional circumstances.  Despite the undoubted hardship to be experienced by the children, his Honour determined that a custodial sentence was necessary.
81His Honour's rejection of the appellant's submission as to exceptional circumstances did not prevent his Honour determining that the welfare of the appellant's children remained an important factor which could be taken into account as part of his subjective case.  It did not prevent his Honour expressing reservations about the capacity of their mother to adequately look after them.  While these matters did not amount to ""exceptional circumstances"", they were matters which his Honour could take into account when determining whether special circumstances existed which would affect the length of the non-parole period.
82This much was expressly conceded by the Crown in the sentence proceedings, when the Crown said:
""The Crown does not say that it is not a proper matter for your Honour to have regard to in the mix of the matters your Honour would consider ...""  (T.16.20)
""... The overall sentence that your Honour imposes may very well reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and those matters that your Honour indicates plus other subjective material may be had regard to in determining the non-parole period ...""  (T.16.35)
83The approach by his Honour was similar to that approved by Dunford J in Regina v Robert Brian Grbin [2004] NSWCCA 220 at [28] - [34].  At [33] Dunford J said:
""33 As I say in this case I consider that the son's condition, and the need for his father's assistance in his supervision and management constituted an exceptional circumstance such as to justify a finding of special circumstances and a reduction in what would otherwise have been the non-parole period.""
84This ground has not been made out.
Ground 8:  
85The Crown submitted that nowhere in his remarks on sentence did his Honour refer to the purposes of sentencing and in particular, the significance of general deterrence.  The Crown submitted that the extortion of money from a legitimate business by a predatory group required that general deterrence be an important factor in sentencing.  The Crown submitted that this was the type of crime which required denunciation.  The Crown submitted that his Honour's failure to refer to general deterrence might indicate that his Honour did not take it into account.
86While it is true that his Honour made no express reference to any of the purposes of sentencing in his remarks, it is also true that his overall approach made it clear that he had those principles in mind.  A similar complaint was rejected by this Court in R v Nguyen [2010] NSWCCA 331 (Simpson, Hall and Garling JJ) where the Court said:
""43 Two principal points were made on behalf of the CDPP.  One can be disposed of quickly.  It was that, there being no mention in the Remarks on Sentence of the need for the sentences to recognise principles of general deterrence (one of the factors explicitly contained in s16A(2)), it may be inferred that that consideration had been overlooked or given inadequate weight.
44 I would reject that contention.  The issue of general deterrence is fundamental to any sentencing decision, and is known to be of particular importance in offences involving drugs.  I would not infer that this was overlooked.  Rather, I would infer that, by reason of its very primacy, it called for no express statement (although, I would add, it would generally be wise at least to record that it has been taken into account).""
87It is apparent from the contents of the remarks on sentence that his Honour was fully cognisant of the issues which the case presented.  It was the need for general deterrence and denunciation that made this a case where a fulltime sentence of imprisonment had to be imposed.  His Honour plainly recognised this by immediately refusing the respondent bail upon conviction even in the knowledge that this was going to immediately separate the appellant's daughters from their sole carer.
88This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 9:
89The Crown accepted that in order to make good this ground, it had to be demonstrated that the sentences were manifestly inadequate in the well recognised sense that they were unreasonable or plainly unjust (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370 - 371 [25]; Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579 at [8] - [9]).
90The Crown also recognised that absent error, this Court should not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because (if it be the case) the Court would have exercised its discretion differently.
91The Crown submitted that the relevant test was satisfied because in relation to the events of 3 May 2010, the appellant was the principal speaker.  The same was true of the second count.  Thus by the time of the offence in the fourth count the pattern had been established for the extortion of money from the victim.  The Crown submitted that the circumstances of the offences were such that they constituted serious examples of offences of this kind, so that not only the sentences themselves, but their structure, demonstrated error in accordance with the principles in House v R.
92The sentencing of the appellant was not an easy exercise.  He was convicted of engaging in serious criminal conduct on three occasions over a period of 10 days.  He had participated with others in an act of extortion, upon a man trying to establish a legitimate business.  Nevertheless, the amount of money was limited, there was no violence and the circumstances relating counts 3 and 4 strongly pointed to the sentences for those counts at the very least being substantially, if not fully concurrent with the sentences for counts 1 and 2. Although four separate offences were involved, there was a substantial overlap in the offending.
93Apart from the objective seriousness of the offending there were other features of the case that required consideration.  By the time of sentence, the appellant was 45 years of age.  Until 2010 he had offended rarely and had not been sentenced to fulltime custody.  He had experienced a dreadful childhood that had resulted in him suffering post traumatic stress disorder.  It was the opinion of the psychologist that he was suffering severe depression, largely as a consequence of his concern for the welfare of his children.
94A significant factor in his subjective case was that he was the sole carer for his two young children and had been in that role since they were infants.  The evidence was overwhelmingly to the effect that he was a committed and capable parent.  For the period of his imprisonment, the children would be without him and would be in the care of their mother who might not have been able to properly care for them.
95In a number of recent decisions (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120), the importance of a sentencing court taking all relevant matters into account and by a process of intuitive synthesis arriving at an appropriate sentence has been emphasised.  In this case, his Honour concluded that no lesser a sentence than fulltime imprisonment was warranted, but also concluded that concurrent sentences were appropriate and that the non-parole period should be adjusted to reflect the particular circumstances of the case.
96This was an approach well open to his Honour.  I am not persuaded that in all the circumstances the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.  This ground of appeal should be dismissed.
Conclusion
97The orders which I propose are:
(1) I would dismiss the appellant's appeal against conviction.
(2) I would dismiss the Crown's appeal against sentence.
98HARRISON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
99BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		26 June 2013",2013-06-25 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706561,Taylor v R [2013] NSWCCA 157,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with R A Hulme J and the orders he proposes.
2McCALLUM J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  Darren John Taylor applies for leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court at Newcastle.  He was sentenced for a multitude of offences by the late Judge Coolahan on 16 June 2011.  There were errors in the manner in which his Honour approached the sentencing task and these were corrected pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) by the Chief Judge of the District Court, Blanch J, on 23 January 2012.
4The applicant's primary contention is that the initial sentencing exercise was infected by ""jurisdictional error"" and so there was no power to correct the errors pursuant to s 43.   Other errors were also asserted in respect of both sentencing exercises which I will mention in due course.
5The sentencing task was complex.  The applicant was sentenced in respect of 7 offences set out on 3 indictments.  There was a further offence set out in a court attendance notice for which he had been committed for sentence.  There were also 23 further offences listed on 6 Form 1 documents to be taken into account.  The nature of the offences was diverse and they were against both Commonwealth and New South Wales law.
Errors in the initial sentencing exercise
6The problem with the sentences imposed by Coolahan DCJ was that his Honour imposed an aggregate sentence for all of the State offences in the mistaken belief that s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applied. This is the provision that allows for aggregate sentencing and it came into operation three months earlier on 14 March 2011.  His Honour took the precaution of checking with the representatives of the applicant and the Crown shortly before he delivered his remarks on sentence but, regrettably, they both assured him that s 53A applied.  However it did not, because the applicant's pleas had been entered prior to the provision coming into effect:  Pt 21 of Sch 2 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
7The other problem was that his Honour sought to accumulate the aggregate sentence upon the minimum custodial component of the individual sentences he imposed for the Commonwealth offences.  But he expressed the commencement date of the aggregate sentence to be 21 May 2010 when it should have been 11 May 2010.  This was contrary to s 47(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, pursuant to which his Honour's power only extended to specifying the commencement date no later than the earliest day on which the applicant would become entitled to be released from custody in respect of another sentence. 
8Both errors involved Coolahan DCJ doing things that he was not authorised by the applicable legislation to do.  But counsel for the applicant contends that the imposition of the aggregate sentence constitutes ""jurisdictional error"" while accepting that the other error does not.  Why such a distinction should be made was not explained.
9In correcting these errors pursuant to s 43, Blanch J brought back the commencement of the State offences to 11 May 2010 and imposed individual sentences for each offence, guided by what Coolahan DCJ had said were the sentences he would have imposed if he had not imposed an aggregate sentence.
The offences and the sentences
10The total effective sentence imposed by Coolahan DCJ was 12 years 10 days with a minimum custodial component of 8 years 6 months 10 days.
11The total effective sentence imposed by Blanch J was 12 years with a minimum custodial component of 8 years 6 months. 
12It is apparent that all that Blanch J did was to re-impose the same total effective sentence, less the erroneous 10 days that resulted from the miscalculation by Coolahan DCJ of the commencement of sentences for the State offences.
Possession of endangered species
13On two separate dates in September 2008 and January 2009 the applicant was found to be in possession of a North American corn snake and two chameleons.  These creatures were the subject of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (""CITES"") and the applicant's possession of them was contrary to s 303GN(2) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth).  The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 5 years and/or a fine of 1,000 penalty units.  
14Concurrent sentences of 10 months were imposed with a recognizance release order after 6 months.  The sentences were specified by Coolahan DCJ to commence on 11 November 2009.  These sentences and the commencement date were not disturbed in the s 43 exercise carried out by Blanch J.
Dishonesty offences
15In February and March 2008 the applicant received, and later disposed of, a stolen Harley Davidson motor cycle, contrary to s 188(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The maximum penalty for these offences is imprisonment for 12 years.
16Coolahan DCJ said that for these offences he would have imposed sentences of 3 years 9 months and 2 years 8 months respectively.  Blanch J imposed sentences of 3 years and 2 years 9 months, specifying that they each commence on 11 May 2010. He set a non-parole period of 2 years for the first of these sentences and no non-parole period for the second.  Why his Honour varied the terms of the indicative sentences announced by Coolahan DCJ is not apparent.  However, given the accumulation of sentences, this made no practical difference to the end result.
17Taken into account on two Form 1 documents in sentencing for these offences were offences of disposing of another stolen motor cycle, receiving a stolen helmet, dealing with $12,770 which was the proceeds of crime, possession of two different prohibited drugs, and possession of a prescribed restricted substance.  The sentences for the two offences were different on account of the relative seriousness of the Form 1 offences that were taken into account in each case.
Domestic violence offences
18The applicant recklessly inflicted grievous bodily harm upon his partner in February 2008.  This is an offence against s 35(2) of the Crimes Act.  The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years and there is a standard non-parole period of 4 years. 
19The applicant and his partner had been in a relationship for about 16 years and had 5 children.  On the occasion in question he assaulted her in the presence of two of the children.  This involved him pushing her to the ground and stomping on her wrist which caused a very serious fracture.   Taken into account in sentencing for this offence were five offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and three offences of assault, all concerning the same victim and constituted by violent conduct towards her on eight separate occasions between August 2006 and September 2009.
20Coolahan DCJ would have imposed a sentence for this offence of 3 years imprisonment.  Blanch J imposed a sentence of the same length, specifying that it commence on 11 May 2012.  He set a non-parole period of 2 years.
Firearms, prohibited weapons and proceeds of crime offences
21Another indictment charged the applicant with offences of possessing firearms and prohibited weapons as well as dealing with the proceeds of crime.  
22One count concerned the applicant's unauthorised possession of more than three unregistered firearms, any one of which was a prohibited firearm or pistol, contrary to s 51D(2) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW).  The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 20 years and there is prescribed a standard non-parole period of 10 years.  
23The applicant was found to be in possession in January 2009 of more than three firearms; he was in fact in possession of 30.  Thirteen of them were prohibited firearms and three were pistols.  They were all found at his home, many of them in a hidden room.  Most of them were operable but some of them were not.  One was a .22 calibre rifle found leaning against a wall in the lounge room.  It had a silencer affixed.  Underneath the applicant's bed were a large pistol within a leather holster and a .22 calibre shortened rifle with a loaded magazine attached.  A quantity of .22 calibre ammunition was also found within the bedroom.
24The offences on a Form 1 attaching to this count were possession of ammunition without a permit (about 700 rounds of various calibre found in the bedroom and the hidden room), not keeping a firearm safely (the loaded gun under the bed) and possession of a firearm barrel without a permit (a shotgun barrel with no serial number). 
25Coolahan DCJ said that he would have imposed a sentence for this offence of 8 years.  Blanch J imposed a sentence of 7 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years, dating from 10 May 2014.  (The commencement date should have been 11 May 2014, but nothing turns on this.)
26The second count on this indictment was an offence of possessing prohibited weapons, an offence against s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years.  There is also prescribed a standard non-parole period of 3 years.
27The prohibited weapons comprised two crossbows, a number of imitation pistols, a Taser-like device, a set of knuckle dusters, a push dagger and a slingshot.  These were found at the applicant's home on the same occasion as the firearms.  Taken into account in sentencing for this offence was one of not keeping a prohibited weapon safely (a crossbow found in the hidden room, next to a cache of arrows).
28Coolahan DCJ would have imposed a sentence for this offence of 5 years.  Blanch J imposed a sentence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years but he specified that it would be concurrent with the firearms sentence.
29The third count was one of dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act.  The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 15 years. 
30The applicant was, on the same occasion at his home, found to be in possession of two stolen firearms and a variety of other stolen property (televisions, identity cards and documents, jewellery, watches and power tools).  Taken into account in sentencing for this offence were five offences of possessing protected fauna (frogs, bearded dragons, water dragons and turtles).  
31Coolahan DCJ would have imposed a sentence of 5 years.  Blanch J imposed a sentence of 5 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years, concurrent with the other sentences on this indictment. 
Subjective and other matters relevant to sentence
32The applicant was aged 40 at the time of sentence.  He had a criminal history but not one of great significance except that he was on two 2-year good behaviour bonds at the time of all of the offences, an aggravating feature that Coolahan DCJ did not mention in his sentencing remarks.  His Honour did take into account that the applicant was on bail for some of the offences at the time others were committed.
33There was evidence to the effect that the applicant had descended into a life of drug abuse when he started smoking ""ice"" in 2005.  Financial difficulties followed.  The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings and it included a claim that he had since turned away from drugs.  There was evidence that he had sought out drug rehabilitation programs; he was seeing a counsellor about drug and alcohol issues as well as domestic violence; he had the support of his family; and he had been, in effect, a model prisoner which included his mentoring of other inmates.   
34His Honour was only prepared to find that ""to some degree"" the applicant was remorseful. He accepted that he had good prospects of rehabilitation.  He said that he would allow a discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty of 25 per cent for the domestic violence offence and 10 per cent for all of the other offences (there was a difference in the timing of the pleas). 
35It was conceded by Queen's Counsel on the applicant's behalf that the most serious of the offences were those involving his possession of firearms.  The applicant claimed that he had developed an interest in such items from when he was raised in a country farming environment; he acquired a collection.  His Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was dealing in firearms, and was not prepared to accept that they were linked to drug dealing or other unlawful activity.  He did find, however, that there was no evidence of any ""innocent"" explanation for the applicant's possession of these items.
36Coolahan DCJ was unimpressed with the applicant's evidence.  He found that he was evasive and had not yet accepted the seriousness of his offences or taken full responsibility for them.   He said that he did not take this into account in favour of the prosecution; but it was relevant to the applicant's remorse, prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of re-offending. 
37Towards the end of his remarks on sentence his Honour explained how he would approach the question of concurrence and accumulation of sentences.  This was theoretical, given that he imposed an aggregate sentence, but it served to explain how the individual sentences he indicated he would have imposed transformed into the total term and the non-parole component.  It can be inferred that his Honour's reasons assisted Blanch J in the correction exercise pursuant to s 43. 
38Special circumstances under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for setting a non-parole period less than the usual proportion of the total term of the sentence were found, but only to a modest degree and for the reason that ""this will be the offender's first time in custody"".
Grounds of appeal
39Eighteen grounds of appeal were notified.  Many overlap and some were abandoned.  In the following paragraphs I have isolated the essential complaints that were raised.
""Jurisdictional error""
40As I indicated earlier, the primary contention by counsel who appeared on the application, and who did not appear in the court below, was that there was jurisdictional error in the imposition of an aggregate sentence because Coolahan DCJ had proceeded ""in excess of jurisdiction"".  It was submitted that the only manner in which the error could be rectified was by way of appeal to this Court and the remedy was for the sentences to be quashed and the matter remitted to the District Court for re-sentencing.  It was also submitted that s 43 ""presumes the jurisdiction to sentence"" and so had no application.
41Section 43 provides, relevantly, as follows:
43  Court may reopen proceedings to correct sentencing errors(1)  This section applies to criminal proceedings (including proceedings on appeal) in which a court has: (a)  imposed a penalty that is contrary to law, or(b)  failed to impose a penalty that is required to be imposed by law, and so applies whether or not a person has been convicted of an offence in those proceedings.(2)  The court may reopen the proceedings (either on its own initiative or on the application of a party to the proceedings) and, after giving the parties an opportunity to be heard: (a)  may impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law, and(b)  if necessary, may amend any relevant conviction or order....
42The applicant was represented by very experienced counsel when he appeared before Blanch J and there was no suggestion that his Honour did not have the power to correct the sentencing errors by Coolahan DCJ in the manner in which he did.
43The ambit of s 43 was recently considered by a five-judge bench in Achurch v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 117.  There is nothing to be served by any detailed review here of the various judgments.  Suffice to say that the discussion of numerous authorities on s 43 is replete with examples of the section being accepted to apply in situations in which sentencing judges have imposed a sentence that was beyond their statutory power.  This is precisely what s 43 and its predecessors were intended to do.  See, for example, the various cases discussed in the joint judgment of Bathurst CJ and Garling J at [24]-[39].  Those cases, and the legislative history of s 43, led to the majority conclusion in Achurch that even the narrowest possible reading of ""contrary to law"" extended at least to the imposition of penalties which there was no power to lawfully impose (at [59]).
44There is no doubt that the aggregate sentence imposed by Coolahan DCJ was ""contrary to law"" and was amenable to the correction effected by Blanch J.  Indeed, an important purpose of s 43 is to avoid the need to appeal or seek judicial review:  Ho v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995) 82 A Crim R at 90.  There is no merit in the grounds of appeal on this subject.
Failure to apply discounts for pleas of guilty to the sentences imposed
45It was contended in written submissions, and not developed further at the hearing of the application, that whilst Coolahan DCJ had announced that he would allow discounts to reflect the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty, he failed reduce the sentences accordingly.  There is no merit in this contention.  
46Coolahan DCJ said:
So far as the pleas are concerned, in all but the domestic violence offence I would allow a discount of 10 per cent.  For that offence I would allow a discount of 25 per cent. (ROS 35)
47A short time later he announced the sentences he imposed for the Commonwealth offences and the sentences he ""would have imposed"" for the State offences if not for the fact that he was imposing an aggregate sentences.  The individual sentences imposed by Blanch J largely correlated with what Coolahan DCJ indicated he ""would have imposed"".  There is nothing from which a conclusion could be drawn that the discounts were not applied. 
The sentences for the firearms offences and the domestic violence offence are manifestly excessive and the non-parole period for the State offences is manifestly excessive
48It was asserted in written submissions, and not developed further at the hearing of the application, that there were a number of features that should lead to a conclusion that the sentences for the firearms offences (presumably including the prohibited weapons offence) were manifestly excessive.  These were that a number of the firearms were inoperable; that ""they were (essentially) secured""; the types of firearms/weapons; the finding that the applicant's possession of these items was not linked to drugs or other unlawful activity and that he was not involved in dealing in them; and the finding that the firearms offences were ""around the mid range of seriousness"".  
49These were all matters that Coolahan DCJ considered.  But also for consideration were the sheer number of firearms and weapons; their nature; the fact that some were not secured; and that they included a rifle with a silencer affixed found in the lounge room and a shortened, loaded rifle found under the applicant's bed.  There were also the Form 1 offences that the applicant asked be taken into account.
50It was also contended that the sentence for the domestic violence offence was manifestly excessive but no attempt was made to justify the contention.  It seems to me that the sentence was relatively modest, particularly given the number and nature of the assaults that the applicant asked to be taken into account, the majority of which involved the infliction of actual bodily harm.
51In relation to the effective non-parole period of 8 years for the State offences, it was contended that it was manifestly excessive on account of the applicant's good prospects of rehabilitation, prior criminal record, the finding that he was currently ""drug free"" and the finding that he was ""to a degree remorseful"".  These were all matters taken into account by Coolahan DCJ.  But he was also required to set a non-parole period that reflected other matters relevant to the sentencing task.  I observed in Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7, with the concurrence of Macfarlan JA and Adams J, at [27]:  
The non-parole period is the minimum period of actual incarceration that the offender must spend in custody having regard to all the elements of punishment, including rehabilitation, the objective seriousness of the offence and the offender's subjective circumstances: Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623 at 627-629; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [59]; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [34].
52The offences for which the applicant was sentenced reflected a staggering range of criminal activity, some of it of considerable seriousness.  I am not persuaded that there is any merit in the contention of manifest excess in any of the sentences or non-parole periods, either as initially imposed or as corrected. 
Failure to take into account pre-sentence custody
53A complaint raised in the context of the manifest excess grounds is that there was an error in not taking into account pre-sentence custody.  The point is unclear in the written submissions and nothing further was said about it at the hearing.  It has been left for the Court to deduce whether any error occurred.
54The Particulars of Trial document filed by the Crown indicates that the applicant was in custody from 29 September 2009 until he was released on bail on 27 January 2010.  He returned to custody on 18 February 2010 and remained there until sentenced.  Accordingly, he was at large for a period of 21 days in the period since 29 September 2009.  His sentences should have been specified to commence on 20 October 2009, not 11 November 2009.  This calculation closely accords with the agreed position put to Coolahan DCJ at the sentence hearing when counsel for the Crown and the applicant indicated that the sentences should be backdated to 21 October 2009 (19.5.11 at T 42). 
55In his sentencing remarks, Coolahan DCJ at first said:
[I]t has been agreed that if the sentence or sentences are to take into account all such pre-sentence custody, they should commence on 21 November 2009. (ROS 4)
56But later when announcing the sentences, for a reason not apparent, his Honour specified that the earliest sentence would date from 11 November 2009.  Blanch J was not asked to correct the error and so, as would be expected, adopted the same date.
Conclusion
57In my view this application for leave to appeal is entirely unmeritorious.  If it were not for the technical error in the commencement dates for the sentences I would have proposed that leave to appeal be refused.  However, because of that error it is necessary that leave be granted so as to enable the Court to make the necessary correction.
Orders
58I propose the following orders:
1. Leave to appeal granted.
2. Appeal allowed.
3.  Sentences imposed in the District Court confirmed but the dates of commencement and the expiry of non-parole periods are adjusted as follows:
On each of the two counts of possession of a CITES specimen, the sentences are to date from 20 October 2009.  The recognizance release order is to date from 20 April 2010.
On each of the counts of receiving and disposing of stolen property, the sentences are to date from 20 April 2010.  The non-parole period of the sentence for receiving stolen property is to expire on 19 April 2012.  (It is noted that no non-parole period was fixed for the disposing of stolen property).
For the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm, the sentence is to date from 20 April 2012.  The non-parole period is to expire on 19 April 2014.
For the offence of unauthorised possession of more than three unregistered firearms any one of which is a prohibited firearm or pistol, the sentence is to date from 20 April 2014.  The non-parole period is to expire on 19 April 2018.
For the offences of possession of a prohibited weapon and dealing with the proceeds of crime, the sentences are to date from 20 April 2014 and the non-parole periods are to expire on 19 April 2017.
Specify that the offender will be eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period for the offence of unauthorised possession of more than three unregistered firearms any one of which is a prohibited firearm or pistol on 19 April 2018.

		27 June 2013",2013-06-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706567,R v Jacobs (No 4) [2013] NSWSC 945,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1Application has been made by the Crown Prosecutor for a view pursuant to s 53 of the Evidence Act 1995. In other words, it is proposed that the whole Court, including the jury, would travel to Tamworth in order to view a number of sites including, but not limited to, the scene of the shooting. The position of defence counsel is not that he strenuously opposes the application, but he has helpfully raised a number of considerations. 

2There are a number of factors that argue in favour of a view being conducted. First, although the jury has been provided, and will be provided, with a plethora of material showing the relevant scenes, as Detective Sansom said in cross-examination today, photos can be misleading as to depth and distance. Furthermore, photos, of course, cannot show every relevant detail of a scene. 

3Secondly, my own experience as an advocate and as a judge is that one's understanding of a scene is very much enhanced by viewing it in person. 

4Thirdly, there will be more than one site worth visiting. As I understand it, the Crown Prosecutor proposes that the jury would inspect at least, first, the scene of the shooting, that is [XXX] Lorraine Street, Tamworth; secondly, the service station alleged to have been visited by the accused shortly before; and thirdly, the layout of the roads discussed in the evidence and, in particular, the roads that connect those two points. 

5Fourthly, it seems from the file that the trial was originally listed to be conducted in Tamworth but was moved to Sydney in order to ensure that the accused receive a fair trial. If the trial were in Tamworth or in any other part of the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, conducting a view would have presented no difficulty of logistics, time or money. It could be said that it would be an odd result if steps taken to ensure a fair trial for the accused also had the indirect effect of prohibiting the Crown from presenting evidence as comprehensively as it wished. 

6Fifthly, the count in the indictment is exceptionally serious.

7Sixthly, the issue in the trial is whether the accused was the shooter or, rather, another man who escaped the scene was the shooter. In order to judge whether the Crown has disproved the latter hypothesis beyond reasonable doubt, it could be said that the jury would be assisted by closely examining the layout of the scene and such details as, for example, the height of surrounding fences. 

8Seventhly, I have been told from the Bar table by the learned Crown Prosecutor that the relevant scenes have not changed very much at all. 

9Against those seven factors are the expense and general difficulty in getting the jury and the court as a whole 400 kilometres from Sydney to Tamworth. I had a particular concern as to whether or not the jury could be properly insulated from the public and from members of the court party if a commercial flight were to be used. 

10Today I have been told by the Crown Prosecutor that the proposed arrangements are as follows: the twelve jurors and two sworn officers would travel to and from Tamworth by charter aircraft in the course of a single day. The cost of that charter would be in the vicinity of $10,000. Allowing for all other costs pertaining to the travel of the court party, I think it is appropriate to be on the safe side and to consider that that would be in the vicinity of $2,500. In other words, what is under discussion is a sum of $12,500. 

11That sum is not to be dismissed as small. On the other hand, in the scheme of things, and with particular regard to the cost of the trial as a whole (including the cost of the trial being conducted in Sydney), and the cost of the operation of the criminal justice system as a whole, the sum of $12,500 is not enormous. 

12The proposed use of a charter plane puts my fears at rest about the jury not being able to be properly insulated from members of the public. 

13Mr Hoyle SC has indicated that the accused wishes to be at the view. He raised his own concern as to the logistics of the accused getting there in circumstances whereby the accused would not be, for example, exhausted. He indicated that in his experience the trip takes about five hours by car, and no doubt it would take more by prison van. The Crown Prosecutor mentioned today from the Bar table in response to the raising of that concern the fact that the accused is subject to a special escort when he arrives at and leaves court each day, and the Crown Prosecutor, or those who instruct him, have been informed that a special escort would be arranged for the accused either by way of plane or car. 

14Speaking for myself, I am respectfully confident that the Department of Corrective Services would be able to ensure the presence of the accused in a reasonably practical way. 

15Mr Hoyle SC also raised the question of whether or not the defence would be in a position to point out relevant features of sites in Tamworth. I respectfully agree that, of course, if we are to undertake a view to that town, it would be most desirable that, at the time, the wish of defence counsel as to the inspection of any sites that could be of assistance to his case should be accommodated. With regard to that, I would be open to suggestions as to how defence counsel before the view, or perhaps someone acting on his behalf, could inspect the scenes beforehand in order to ensure that a desire by defence counsel to inspect them and to have the jury inspect them is soundly based. 

16Finally, Mr Hoyle SC queried whether the jury may misuse the view. In other words, despite the fact that what the jury perceives on any view does indeed become evidence, nevertheless the jury may, in his submission, place undue weight on what they have seen or otherwise perceived, and improperly discount the evidence given in the witness box by witnesses, and perhaps by way of real evidence that has become exhibits. I consider that there is some truth in that proposition, but I would have thought that careful direction, cross-examination, addresses and, if necessary, having the show-er at the view make clear how things such as layout, weather, and traffic are different from what pertained on 2 March 2012, would substantially ameliorate that problem. 

17To my mind there are factors mitigating against the granting of a view. If the charge were any less serious than it is, I would not be open to conducting a view in Tamworth, 400 kilometres away from Sydney, that would involve the arrangements and expense and time taken that I have described. 

18However, on reflection, I consider that in order to ensure that both parties are able to present evidence as clearly and as effectively as possible, a view should be conducted. I have come to that view even taking into account the considerations helpfully raised by defence counsel. 

19I turn then to the matters that I am required to consider by way of s 53 of the Evidence Act. 

20I am satisfied that the parties will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present, and of course funds should be available to permit Mr Hoyle SC's presence if the matter is legally aided. I would have thought it is highly desirable that both instructing solicitors be present as well. 

21The accused of course may be present if he wishes to be. If so, it is clear that the Department of Corrective Services needs to make arrangements to have him there in good time and in good order. As the recent decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal of Jamal v R [2012] NSWCCA 198 makes clear, the view is part of the trial and, if he wishes, the accused may most certainly be present. 

22The jury will of course be there. That is the whole point of the exercise. 

23As for the factors enumerated in s 53(3) of the Evidence Act, at the least the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel will be there and, as I have said, I have been told that the accused wishes to be there as well, and if that remains the case he will be there. To be clear about it, the view will not be conducted in the absence of the accused if he wishes to be present. 

24I am affirmatively satisfied that the view will assist the jury in resolving issues of fact and especially in understanding the evidence. 

25To my mind there is little to suggest that the view would be prejudicial. The scene has changed, I am told, but the jury can receive evidence of that and make their own assessment. As I have said, the jury can also be directed not to let their own impressions gained during the view overwhelm the other evidence in the trial presented in the courtroom. It is not suggested that anything will be seen whilst the jury is on the view that reflects badly on the accused's character. Nor of course will any members of the public accompany the jury or the court party on the view. 

26Nor to my mind will the view be misleading. As I have said, if there have been changes to scenes, they can be identified. 

27Far from the view being confusing, I consider that it will be an aid to clarity of understanding. 

28The view will indeed take time but, in all the circumstances, the time that will need to be taken for travel, arrangements, lunch and so forth will not, to my mind, be ""an undue waste of time"", to use the words of the section. 

29Finally, completing my analysis of the mandatory considerations in s 53, as I have said, I am told that the various scenes have not changed very much at all since 2 March 2012. 

30In all the circumstances, I consider that the application that a view be conducted should be granted. Because there is a possibility that the day of the view will start earlier and end later than normal, I propose to give the jury two or three possible dates, and ask them to decide collectively which date suits them best. 

31My order then is that the application for a view in the form of an inspection of various sites in Tamworth is granted.

2706568,R v Jacobs (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 944,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1Defence counsel has submitted that the jury should be discharged on the basis that the Crown Prosecutor's opening was inappropriate. The application was made immediately after the end of the address, but deferred until now to permit the smooth running of the trial and also in order to permit the parties and me to consider the transcript. 

2Three points were made founding the application. The first was that the address generally crossed the line from setting out the expected Crown evidence to an exercise in forensic persuasion. The second was that the Crown Prosecutor asked a rhetorical question that had the potential impermissibly to reverse the onus of proof. The third was that the Crown Prosecutor should not have revealed that when Mr Terry Price, who is said on the defence case to be the real shooter, was interviewed and denied the offence, he was under no compulsion to speak to police unless he wished to do so. 

3Defence counsel has this morning made it clear that he does not seek a lengthy judgment, and I respectfully agree that the application can be disposed of rather shortly. To my mind the speech of the Crown Prosecutor was a lucid exposition of the Crown case, both as to what the evidence will be and the meaning that the jury will be asked to ascribe to that evidence. It was not, in my opinion, an exercise in persuasion or urging. It was somewhat lengthy, but that was a reflection of the fact that the Crown case has a number of discrete bases. As for tone, a matter that the transcript will not of course reflect, in my opinion it was firm but never inflamed or inflammatory. I respectfully reject the first basis of criticism. 

4As for the second basis, the rhetorical question, namely, why would the accused do such a thing as shoot a police officer over an RBT stop, was not asked of the accused or of the defence case. Rather, it was a question to be asked of the prosecution case, and the Crown Prosecutor went on to detail the expected evidence that may provide some answer to that question. To my mind the rhetorical question, therefore, had no potential to reverse the onus of proof. To the extent that the transcript of my earlier discussions with counsel last Friday suggests that I was of a different view, it is incorrect, and I will seek the concurrence of counsel to correct it. 

5As for the third aspect relied upon, a number of aspects are noteworthy. 

6First, it would be surprising if any juror believed that an Australian citizen is compelled to answer questions of police when suspected of an offence. 

7Secondly, I am told that there will be evidence that the accused exercised his right to silence and I will, therefore, need to give at least one direction about that. Any such direction, to have any real force, will almost certainly need to speak in generalities. 

8Thirdly, even if such a warning, at the request of defence counsel, does not speak in generalities, it would be remarkable for the jury to be told that the accused had a right to silence, but not come to the view that Mr Price had one as well. 

9Fourthly, even if - a proposition that I do not necessarily accept - the Crown Prosecutor was wrong to bolster the credibility of Mr Price in the way that he did, in the scheme of things that was of no great moment and certainly would not, to my mind, lead to a discharge. 

10It follows that each of the three bases for the discharge of the jury are rejected. 

11Speaking more generally, far from founding a discharge of the jury, I should record that I regard the Crown Prosecutor's opening as a soundly appropriate example of an oration by an officer of the court who combines the role of an advocate with that of a minister of justice. 

12It follows that the application to discharge the jury is respectfully refused.

		16 July 2013",2013-06-16 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2706579,Cooper v Mulcahy Mulcahy v Cooper [2013] NSWCA 160,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  I agree with the orders and directions proposed by Hoeben JA and with his reasons.
2MEAGHER JA:  I agree with Hoeben JA.
3HOEBEN JA:Nature of AppealBetween November 1992 and September 2007 the appellant (Mr Cooper) and the respondent (Ms Mulcahy) were parties to a domestic relationship for the purposes of the Property (Relationships) Act 1984 (NSW) (""the Relationships Act"").  The appellant brought proceedings against the respondent seeking an adjustment of interest with respect to their assets, pursuant to s 20 of the Relationships Act.  
4The respondent cross-claimed seeking an adjustment.  She also claimed damages for various assaults and batteries which she said had occurred during the relationship.
5On 23 April 2012 Associate Justice Macready made orders to the effect that an appropriate adjustment of the assets of the parties was 40 percent to the appellant and 60 percent to the respondent.  His Honour made orders as to the sale of certain properties in order to achieve that result.
6With respect to the respondent's cross-claim, the primary judge entered judgment in favour of the respondent in the sum of $480,408 made up as follows:
Damages for assaults and batteries$ 142,000.00Aggravated damages with respect to the assault and batteries$ 100,000.00Past out of pocket expenses$   19,218.35Past economic loss$ 112,011.03Future economic loss$   46,859.00Future out of pocket expenses$   60,320.00
7The appellant has appealed against the calculations made by the trial judge in relation to the adjustment of assets between him and the respondent in that he submits that $300,000 should not have been ""added back"" into the ""asset pool"".  He has appealed against the damages awarded for the assaults and batteries in that the respondent should not have been found to be under a disability within the meaning of s 52 of the Limitation Act 1969 and the damages awarded were excessive.  He has appealed against the balance of damages awarded to the respondent in her cross-claim in that there was no evidence to support that award.
8The respondent has cross-appealed against the trial judge's refusal to order the appellant to pay her forthwith the value of her share of the property after adjustment.  She has contended that the judgment in her favour on her cross-claim should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied upon by the trial judge, in that the order for adjustment of property should be increased in her favour, having regard to the principle in In the Marriage of Kennon (1997) 22 Fam LR 1.
Factual background
9The appellant was born in 1957 and the respondent in 1951 so that when their relationship commenced in November 1992, the appellant was aged 41 and the respondent 35.  They each had children from previous relationships.  The appellant had three children who were then living with their mother and the respondent had two children, Wade aged 16 and David aged 20, who at the commencement of the relationship were residing with the respondent.  Shortly after the relationship commenced, David moved out.
10When the relationship commenced, the appellant moved into the respondent's home in the Brisbane suburb of Gaythorne.  At that time, the appellant was working for a company, Roof Shield, in Brisbane.  The respondent had not worked in paid employment since 1983.  At the commencement of the relationship, she was in receipt of a sole parent pension.
11In 1992/3 the appellant moved to Melbourne to conduct a Roof Shield franchise in that city.  The respondent joined him some months later. While in Melbourne, the respondent did not work and continued to receive social security benefits.  She let the property at Gaythorne.
12In 1994 the parties returned to Brisbane and lived in the respondent's home at Gaythorne.  The appellant continued to conduct a roof restoration business until he suffered a work injury and received sickness benefits.
13In November 1995 the parties moved to the Sunshine Coast for approximately seven months during which time the appellant was involved in another roofing business known as ""Wetcheck"".  In 1996 the parties commenced travelling around Australia and continued to do so until 2000.  This involved them selling a range of products at field days and trade shows, including welding rods, sunglasses, hats and the like.  Both the appellant and the respondent participated in the work involved.
14From 2000 the parties became property investors.  They spent considerable amounts of time developing properties which they purchased during the relationship.  Initially in 1999 these were properties at Coldstream Street, Yamba and at Southbank Road at Harwood in New South Wales.  Later in 2003, an adjoining property to this was purchased and the overall parcel of land was developed.  In 2003 the parties purchased a block of units in South Grafton, which was sold in 2007 for a significant profit.
15In 2006 the parties became involved in a business selling mobile telephones.  They each held a 50 percent share in a company, Janmel Pty Ltd, which owned the business.  It was the appellant who almost exclusively did the work relating to the business.  He continued doing that work after the parties separated.
16Although the parties physically separated in 2007, there was a period of emotional interaction until May 2008.  Between September 2007 and May 2008, the parties went to Bribie Island together, the appellant visited the respondent at Mitchelton staying overnight and the parties had a holiday in Vanuatu in December 2007.
17At the commencement of the relationship, the appellant had assets consisting of:
Savings$   6,000.00Vehicle$   1,000.00Trade debts$   4,000.00
18The respondent's property consisted of:
The Gaythorne property$ 150,000.000Household goods$     15,000.00Bank accounts and cash$          900.00
The respondent had debts of $33,000 at the time.
19Between 1998 and September 2007 the parties purchased and sold a number of properties.  When the relationship ended, the following real estate was held by them:
A jointly owned home at Southbank Road.A jointly owned cane farm at Southbank Road.50 percent interest in River Road, which the respondent owned with her son Wade.A jointly owned removal house near the cane farm.The respondent's home at Gaythorne.
The house at Southbank Road was valued at $425,000 at separation and the cane farm at $550,000.  The evidence did not address the value of the other real estate at the conclusion of the relationship.
20There were liabilities to the bank for a line of credit of $406,855.66, a loan on the farm of $394,803.76 and a half share of the loan on River Road of $65,000.  The removal house was sold in October 2007 and the proceeds of $415,000 paid to reduce the line of credit and loan.
21There were, in addition, bank accounts and personal property which the primary judge took into account when adjusting the financial interests of the parties.
The findings at trial
22The primary judge noted that the respondent sold her home at Gaythorne in January 2008.  The primary judge found that this sale was part of a re-arrangement of her family's properties which, unknown to the appellant, she commenced before the separation.  As a result of a series of transactions engaged in by the respondent, in collaboration with both of her sons but predominantly David, the Gaythorne property was sold, loans were advanced from the bank and loans were also advanced by the Mulcahy Family Trust (which had been established) to David facilitating the purchase by him of another property.  The entire arrangement was quite sophisticated and is set out at RAB 132D -V.
23In relation to the appellant, the primary judge found that he had transferred $250,000 from a joint CBA account into an account in his own name.  A further $50,000 was transferred into that account.  As a result, his honour found:
"" These amounts reflect in his present assets and thus there should be an add-back of $300,000 to ascertain the properties of the parties at the date of the hearing. Given the lack of cross-examination of the defendant on this issue it is quite clear that he misled the defendant by telling her the $250,000 had been put into a joint account when she challenged him on the matter.""  (RAB 133G-J)
24By adding back that $300,000, the pool to be apportioned between the parties became $1,605,782.00.
25In his judgment as to costs of 29 May 2012 the trial judge implicitly accepted that he had made an error in adding back $300,000.  The error had arisen because the trial judge had not appreciated that evidence of payments in the appellant's affidavit of 2 September 2011 had not been challenged.  In that regard, his Honour said (J4.5):
""The amount of the claims for joint expenses of $20,802 and $69,594 has not been questioned by the defendant and I would have presumably allowed a deduction in this amount of $90,396.
What happened to the balance in the Net Saver Account has not been explained to me in any submissions and is not really explained in the evidence.
The only adjustment that I would thus consider is a reduction of $300,000 down to $209,604.""
26Despite identifying that error, the primary judge made no change to his judgment since the application was made under the slip rule.  He concluded that the slip rule did not apply in that it ""does not confer a power to supplement or vary final orders by making substantive alterations to determine points that were not argued, considered or decided at the hearing"".  There is, of course, nothing to prevent this Court making such an alteration if it is appropriate.
27The primary judge made a number of uncomplimentary assessments of the appellant as a witness.  He found him to be argumentative and to have a careless attitude to the accuracy of the evidence which he gave.  He found him to have exaggerated on occasions.  The primary judge was unimpressed by the appellant's tendency to deal with the respondent's cross-claim by making blanket denials.  
28The primary judge's conclusion was:
""97 From my assessment of the plaintiff in the witness box and notwithstanding his restrained approach to the questioner for most of the time, he appeared to be a person who could become quite angry. He was a big bluff man. It may well be that he has difficulty recalling the details of what happened when he was angry. This is another difficulty, which compounds the main difficulty namely, that he has made a blanket denial of the assault cases which is not appropriate.  Accordingly I do not accept that he always gives accurate evidence.""  (RAB 161I-M)
29In relation to the respondent, the primary judge noted that she had not fully disclosed what had happened to the proceeds of the sale of Gaythorne and the purchase of a property by the Mulcahy Family Trust.  He noted that it only emerged in cross-examination that the rental from the River Road property was received by her in a bank account operated by her son on her behalf.  His Honour found that these were serious matters which affected the credit of the respondent (RAB 162O-V).  While the primary judge was not prepared to find that the respondent had a general tendency to exaggerate, he said:
""105 What is of more concern is her failure to answer questions. On numerous occasions the defendant commenced an answer to a question, ""Oh my goodness"" or ""goodness"". Very often what followed on these occasions was either a lack of recall or a suggestion that someone else be asked about it or even more frankly, on one occasion, ""Oh my goodness, I do not know how to answer that question"".  (RAB 163G-J)""
30His Honour's conclusion was:
""108 Although there are some matters which indicate that the defendant has not put her case forward to the Court honestly in that she has not given all necessary financial information I did not get the impression that she was prone to exaggeration. She did appear, however, to evade answering some questions. Accordingly, her evidence has to be treated with caution.""  (RAB 163R-S)
31The primary judge made findings in relation to the assaults and batteries, alleged by the respondent in her cross-claim.  The reason he did so at this point was that it was necessary for him to make an assessment of the relative contribution of the parties to their asset position on separation.  The assaults, if established, might play a part in that process.
32In relation to the concept of an assault, his Honour said:
""Assault allows redress for the creation of an undesired emotional state unaccompanied by external injury. ... 
Since the gist of assault lies in the apprehension of impending contact, the effect on the victim's mind created by the threat is the crux, not whether the defendant actually had the intention to follow it up.""  (RAB 164F-J)
33His Honour found that an assault occurred in May 1993 which he described as the ""threat in note"".  The parties planned to take a short holiday to Yamba before the appellant left for Melbourne.  Before that happened, the parties had an argument during which the appellant used abusive language to the respondent.  The appellant left the house and when the respondent entered the kitchen, she found a note which said:
""I'll be back after I get back from Melbourne to get the rest of my stuff.  I'd strongly advise you not to be here so I'll ring first.  
P.S.  I can't believe the poison you've stored going back so far.  Fuck you!!!!!!""
34The appellant conceded that he wrote the note and that it was preceded by an argument which occurred before a trip by him to Melbourne.  The primary judge accepted the respondent's evidence that the note caused her to become afraid and that, therefore, the note was sufficient to establish an assault.
35His Honour accepted that on 18 February 2008 an attempt at reconciliation over dinner resulted in an argument between the parties.  While he accepted that the appellant had shouted at the respondent and used abusive language, he did not find that an assault had taken place because any threats which were made were directed at her children, not at the respondent.
36His Honour's approach was similar when considering an alleged assault in May 2008, which involved the appellant swearing over the phone.  His Honour found that the appellant had sworn at the respondent over the phone but that there was a real question about whether there was an assault, since the parties had already separated, and nothing was said which suggested a physical attack was contemplated.  His Honour found that no assault had taken place.
37In relation to another occasion in mid 1993, his Honour accepted that the appellant had used foul and abusive language to the respondent but there was no evidence of any threat having actually been communicated to the respondent.  In those circumstances, his Honour was not prepared to find that an assault had taken place.
38His Honour found that an assault and battery took place in 1995.  The circumstances were that in early 1995, the appellant intended to build a shed in the backyard at Gaythorne.  Although the yard had been levelled, by June 1995 the shed had not been constructed but building materials and other refuse were piling up in the yard.  When the respondent remonstrated with the appellant, the following occurred:
""Bob took hold of my arm and dragged me down the back stairs from the kitchen to the backyard. I stumbled down the stairs, bumping the railings and losing my footing on the way.  Bob pointed to the pile of timber, roofing and windows, which were all for the Wetcheck business, and Bob said to me:
Bob: ""What the fuck do you call that? [indicating towards the disassembled shed]
Me: The shed's not for me or Station Ave, it's purely for Wetcheck's storage.
Bob: I can't fuckin' stand the sound of your fuckin' voice or the fuckin' sight of you. Get out of my fuckin' sight. Disappear. If you don't, I'll fuckin' kill you. I'm fuckin' out of here. I'm going to pack my stuff and find somewhere else to live. Don't come back till I'm gone. I promise you I'll fuckin' kill you.""
207 I went to the train station across the road and sat there for a couple of hours. I felt numb. I returned later that afternoon but Bob's ute was still there, so I knew he had not gone. I stayed hidden in the tool room downstairs. I could hear Bob on the phone upstairs, making enquiries for shared accommodation and then gathering his gear, loading the ute and leaving.""
39On the basis that the respondent left the house, his Honour accepted that there was an assault as well as a battery.
40His Honour found that an assault occurred in 1996.  The evidence of the respondent was:
""237 On two occasions during the seven or eight months we lived in Maroochydore, Bob told me to leave. On the first occasion Bob yelled at me ""Get out of my fucking place. I'll get a fucking flat bed truck and pitch your fucking gear over the fucking balcony"". The reason for this outburst of rage was unclear to me. ... I was shaking and in fear of Bob and what he might do to me. 
I telephoned David and said ""Would you please come and pick me up"", which he did.  I stayed with David at Gaythorne.  I did not contact Bob.  A week or two later Bob came to Gaythorne and drove me back to Maroochydore.  I do not recall saying ""Yes"" to resuming our relationship; I simply did not say ""No"", nor did I have the courage to do so. ...""
41When the respondent was cross-examined, the evidence was:
""Q. And if I could then take you to paragraphs 237 and 238, thank you. I am suggesting to you, ma'am, that the conversation that you have put there you have made up, haven't you?A. No, I haven't. And the fact being that I didn't even know what he was referring to.  It was a flat bed truck.  Because it's the first time I have ever heard the term ""flat bed truck"".
Q.  David did come and collect you on one occasion, is that right?A. He did, yes.""
42The primary judge concluded that there was an assault on the basis of the respondent's lack of understanding of the threat and the fact that she vacated the house.
43There was a second incident in 1996 which his Honour found not to constitute an assault.  This involved the appellant yelling at the respondent while they were in bed:  ""Get out of my fucking bed"".  When she had done so, he drove her to Gaythorne where her son David was staying.  While his Honour accepted that this event had occurred, he was not satisfied that it constituted an assault.
44The primary judge found that an assault had occurred in December 2000.  The respondent's evidence in her affidavit was:
""313 In the afternoon, I was sitting on the lounge reading and feeling tense. Bob said to me out of the blue: 
""If you were a bloke I'd smack your head in"". 
I did not say anything in response, as in my experience that always escalated Bob's anger. After a while I turned on the television.
314 Bob came in from the garage and said: 
""Stop fucking ignoring me""
and turned off the television.  I sat there for some time. I was too anxious to read because I feared that would further inflame Bob.  I feared that anything I did would make Bob more upset, so I just sat there.
315 Bob went in and out of the house several times. His body language indicated he was becoming more and more agitated and upset. He went to the refrigerator and took out a beer. On one of these trips from the fridge to the garage, as he passed by me sitting on the lounge, he poured the entire can of beer over my head, down my body and onto the lounge.
316 I just sat there. I was in what I thought of as 'block-out' mode. I was too anxious to have a shower, for fear of further inflaming Bob's temper. I just sat there, in a pool of spilled beer. I did not dare to have a shower, or go to bed, or to move because I knew he would start screaming. I sat there, adrenaline pumping and heart thudding, for what seemed like hours. I did not get off the lounge to go to the toilet, or read a book, or make dinner, or eat anything at all.  I just sat there, waiting for him to go to bed.
317 Bob went to bed, perhaps an hour later.  I knew he was finally asleep because I heard him snoring, at which point I got up, showered, and finally fell asleep at the other end of the large L-shaped lounge (not where the beer was spilled). I cleaned the couch the next day.
318 In the morning, Bob drove away and did not return until late that evening. I felt humiliated, weak and anxious after this incident. Neither of us mentioned the incident again until 2008 during our attempts to reconcile.""
45By leave, the respondent gave the following evidence at the trial about what also happened on this occasion:
""Q. This beer incident which you have described commencing at paragraph 312 of your major affidavit -- is that correct?A. I am not sure of the paragraph, but yes.
Q. Tell us what in fact was said in the course of this walking in and out as you describe it?A. Most of the time he was just screaming, every time he walked in and out of the house. And on one particular occasion he said ""This is driving me fucking nuts, I really should get rid of the rifles. I am either going to shoot you or shoot myself or both of us.""
Q. Do you recall in the course of the preparation of your major affidavit anything that happened when you were dealing and committing that part of your evidence into the affidavit?A. Yes, I found it very difficult and I said in my affidavit -- it brought me to tears.
Q. When the words were actually uttered back on or about 31 December 2000 what was the effect of the utterance about?A. I was terrified.""
46His Honour noted that the appellant had two rifles, one of which was a .303 which did not have a bolt.  The other rifle had been used by him in the past and he had ammunition for it.  Although the respondent had not mentioned this exchange concerning the rifle to her son David, Dr Klug or Dr Fischer, she had mentioned it to the psychologist, Dr Kraushaar, in September 2009.  
47His Honour accepted that such words had been used by the appellant and said:
""146 The rifles existed, the plaintiff could be an angry man, the defendant had been frightened of him over the years and I am prepared to accept the defendant's version of what occurred. There has been an assault and a separate battery.""  (RAB 181R-T)
48The respondent alleged an assault after Christmas 2000.  This consisted of the appellant using abusive language to the respondent concerning her sons.  Since no threat to the respondent was made, his Honour found that no assault had occurred.
49His Honour found that an assault occurred in mid 2007.  This assault was not referred to in the respondent's affidavit.  The evidence concerning it was given for the first time at trial.  It bears a striking similarity to the assault which his Honour found to have occurred in December 2000 during the course of the ""beer"" incident.
50The evidence was:
""A. ...  Bob was working at the phone shops and he was complaining about the staff and about the area. Things were pretty bad.  And he continually said things like ""I am a big fish in a little pond"" and I turned around to him and said ""We are only shop keepers after all"", which I regretted, straight away.  And he said -- he just flew off.  I can't recall other things he said but he was yelling at me, walking in and out, yelling.  And he said once again ""This is frustrating the shit out of me.  I really should get rid of the rifles.  I will either shoot myself, because I am going nuts, or shoot you.""
Q. What effect did that have on you and your recollection? A. It is a terrifying thing to hear. There were other instances that he said similar things."" (RAB 183F-K)
51In relation to this incident, his Honour found:
""150 This alleged incident was first referred to at the trial when further evidence was given following an almost completed cross-examination of the defendant. It was never referred to in consultation with doctors.  Plainly it was only recalled as a result of further questioning about paragraph 310 of her affidavit.  That said, it has the ring of truth about it.

151 I accept her evidence and it must have been very surprising given that there had been no instances of serious abuse for some seven years.  I can accept that it may have terrified her.  I am satisfied there was an assault.""  (RAB 183 M-R)
52The primary judge then considered what effect the assaults might have had on the asset adjustment process.  His Honour noted the following statements of principle:
""Although the domestic violence complained of related to a relatively small period of time at the end of the marriage, nevertheless, his Honour would, in my opinion, have been entitled to have found that because of the appellant's conduct, the respondent's contribution diminished as a consequence, leading to the overall weighting based upon contribution in favour of the wife being increased, albeit only slightly, having regard to the facts of this case.""  (Doherty v Doherty (1996) FLC 92-652 at 82, 683)""
""This [maintaining the family unit over a long time] was made especially hard by the husband's abuse and denigration of her and the children in the ways described by them in their evidence, which I largely accept on the issue, as well as by his attitude to ""women's work"" and by his drinking which necessitated the wife working especially hard and harder than would be usual in normal situations as homemaker, parent and as the prime navigator of the welfare of this family through the many seas of problems and difficulties which confronted them over the years"".  (Marando v Marando (1997) FLC 92-754 at 84,168-9 Gee J)
53His Honour concluded that in the asset adjustment process, it was possible to take into account the actions of the appellant when assessing the respondent's homemaker contributions.  He noted that the respondent sought that the assaults be taken into account in the adjustment process, as well as seeking damages for them.
54The primary judge set out his conclusion on this issue as follows:
""163 In the present case the plaintiff has given detailed evidence of the affect that the assaults had on her in each case. However, there is little direct evidence of how that effect on her made her homemaker contributions more difficult. The court is left with a limited ability to make any necessary inferences absent that evidence. Assuming that the fear generated by the incidents had some immediate affect on contributions at the time of affectation, a period of some weeks is of minor significance in the overall time frame of this 15-year relationship. This is particularly so given that there was a substantial break for many years between the incidents.  I note that the defendant refers to the continuous effect of the assaults when dealing with damages and I will deal with this later.  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest any effect the assaults had on her other non-financial contributions.""  (RAB 188 F-N)
55In adjusting the interests of the parties in the assets of the relationship, his Honour adopted a global approach.  His Honour set out his conclusions as follows:
""199 Giving due weight to the contributions of Gaythorne by the defendant, I think an appropriate division is 40% to the plaintiff and 60% to the defendant. The property of the parties, with add backs is $1,605,782. After division of this amount into these proportions and subtracting the applicable add backs, the plaintiff receives $342,313 ($642,313 less $300,000) and the defendant $542,469 ($963,469 less $421,000). 

200 Thereafter account should be taken of what other assets have been taken or should be retained by them. These are:

PlaintiffDefendantHousehold contents$5,00050% interest in River Road$67,500Glassware$12,500Art works$15,000Janmell$236,196Mower$  3,000Superannuation$17,000Glassware$12,500Total$270,696Total$98,000
201 Deducting these from each party's entitlements referred to above gives the plaintiff $71,617 ($342,313 less $270,696) and the defendant $444,469 ($542,469 less $163,000) of the remaining assets of the parties. 

202 The balance of the assets of the parties should be sold, debts paid and the resulting sum distributed to the parties in the proportions set out in the preceding paragraph.

203 The defendant made a submission that due to her difficult financial situation she should be paid in cash with the defendant to retain the assets. Given that she will be entitled to her award of damages, which is substantial, this will relieve her financial situation. It is preferable that both parties have an incentive to attend properly to the realisation of their assets.""  (RAB 200 E-201E)
56The primary judge then considered the respondent's cross-claim for assault and in particular, the application of the Limitation Act 1969 (LTA).  His Honour concluded that the May 1993 assault was statute barred and that the 2007 assault was not barred by the Act.  Although the assaults of 1995, 1996 and December 2000 were prima facie statute barred, the respondent relied upon s52 LTA to argue that she was suffering a disability at the time that those events took place and accordingly the running of the limitation period should be suspended for the duration of her disability, i.e. the three year limitation period would not start to run until 9 June 2010.
57After having regard to a series of cases which considered this issue, and having had regard to the medical evidence, his Honour found:
""271 In my view the disability would have commenced after the events in 1993 and continued until a time shortly after the commencement of the proceedings in the Statement of Claim, August 2008, when she started to respond to the claim. The limitation period is therefore suspended, by reason of her disability, until this time.  Applying the three-year limitation period, she brought the proceedings within time.""  (RAB 228I-M)
58The primary judge then proceeded to assess the damages to which the respondent was entitled in her cross-claim.  In relation to the assaults and batteries, the primary judge said:
""164 The apprehension, contact and the injuries arising from the assault and battery is another matter. These are serious matters and are no less reprehensible because they occurred within a domestic arrangement. They should be separately treated to show the Court's disapproval of such matters. ...""  (RAB 188P-R) 
""275 The defendant has satisfied me that five incidents of assault and/or battery occurred and that she has brought her action in relation to these within time. I am also satisfied that by reason of the assaults and batteries the defendant has suffered anxiety and depression.""  (RAB 229J-L)
59By reference to an earlier decision of his (Jackson v Jackson (NSWSC, 26 March 1999, unreported) which involved assault and battery in a domestic context, the primary judge said:
""282 ...  The physical circumstances of that battery were far worse than anything in the present case.  However that case did not include threats to kill.  Such threats had a real effect on the defendant and put her in fear of her life.
283 I have found that the defendant did not suffer from PTSD and that the disability was one in which there is a prognosis that will see the disability resolved. ... 

284 Looking at the individual events, here I would fix general damages as follows:
The threat to kill and battery in 1995 (assault and battery); $50,000
One occasion of ordering the defendant out of the house in 1996 (assault); $2,000
The beer incident and threat to shoot in December 2000 (assault and battery); $50,000
Threat to shoot in 2007 (assault). $40,000
This is a total of $142,000.""  (RAB 230R - 231H)
60The primary judge declined to award exemplary damages but did award aggravated damages.
""293  There are in my view reasons why there should be aggravated damages in this case. This is because, although there has been an award in respect of the individual assaults it can be seen from the medical evidence that the combined effect of the assaults extended over the whole of the relationship with a pervasive affect on the defendant.  I fix aggravated damages at $100,000.""  (RAB 233I-L)
61In relation to the other heads of damage claimed in the cross-claim, his Honour found:
""273 So far as the future is concerned Dr Fischer has opined that her present incapacity will not continue in the future if she has appropriate treatment.  Dr Kraushaar who will no doubt be treating her puts the time for recovery at 12 to 24 months to recover from the trauma.  I accept that its reasonable to expect her inability to work to cease within 2 years from judgment.

274 As to past economic loss Dr Fischer gives evidence, which I accept, that she was incapacitated from working as a shop assistant from the time of separation.""  (RAB 229B-G)
62His Honour then awarded damages as follows:
""285 The defendant is entitled to past out of pocket expenses of $19,218.35.

286 Past economic loss suggested in the defendant's submissions, namely, as a real estate property manager plus interest on half thereof with a 15% allowance for vicissitudes, namely, $112,011.03.

287 Future economic loss is for only 2 years with 15% for vicissitudes, a sum of $46,859.
288 Future out of pocket expenses were predicated on psychological treatment for 4 years, psychiatric treatment, specialist therapy and GP follow up for 10 years. Given the prognosis I have adopted, the psychological and specialist therapy figures need reducing but I would not reduce the others. I fix the amount of future out of pockets at $60,320.""  (RAB 231J-R)
Submissions and consideration
Ground of Appeal 1:  The primary judge erred in finding that the sum of $250,000 and the sum of $50,000 referred to in paragraph [26] of the judgment delivered on 23 April 2012 reflect in the appellant's present assets and thus should be added back to ascertain the properties of the parties at the date of hearings.
Ground of Appeal 2:  The primary judge ought to have found that the ""asset pool"" of the parties was $1,305,782 not $1,605,782.
63The appellant submitted that the finding by the primary judge at RAB 132X - 133J, was based on a misunderstanding of the evidence.  It was also inconsistent with his Honour's finding at (RAB 135U-X).  He submitted that although the primary judge had realised his error when handing down his judgment as to costs on 29 May 2012, it was not sufficient for the addback figure of $300,000 to be reduced by $90,396 (see [25] hereof) but that no part of the $300,000 should have been added back.
64The appellant submitted that the $300,000 had not been removed from the joint asset pool in circumstances where it should be ""added back"".  On the contrary, his unchallenged evidence (affidavit of 2 September 2011) was that the funds had been used for either his own living expenses, had been returned to the respondent or had been used for their joint benefit.
65The appellant submitted that the rationale behind the concept of ""add backs"" was to ensure that one party did not obtain some kind of advantage by realising the assets of the parties for that party's personal benefit before a determination by the court as to how the property should in fact be apportioned.  The appellant submitted that in this case it was clear that both parties were making use of joint funds before the trial to the knowledge of each other.   This was not a case of one party obtaining an advantage, but of a tacit if not express arrangement between them that this would occur insofar as the payment of living expenses was concerned.
66The appellant explained how the $300,000 which had been transferred from joint accounts had been spent.  He did so in his written submissions, but most particularly in documents tendered during the course of the appeal which were entitled ""Addback Chronology"" and ""Supplementary Note Re Addback"".  These documents were in the nature of submissions which explained the appellant's affidavits of 22 September 2009 and 2 September 2011.  The documents were predicated upon the evidence of the appellant in the affidavit of 2 September 2011 being accepted.  This was because no challenge had been made to that evidence as to how the $300,000 had been spent.
67The effect of the appellant's submissions was as follows:  On 5 October 2007 $250,000 had been transferred from a joint account into an account in the appellant's sole name.  On 9 October 2007 an amount of $50,000 was transferred from another joint account into an account in his sole name.  By reference to a bank statement (Blue AB 202 - 206), the $50,000 was accounted for by a withdrawal of $31,140 for the purchase of a car (which was part of the assets at trial), $17,360 was repaid to joint funds and $1,000 was paid to the respondent.
68No challenge was made to the proposition that $17,360 was repaid to joint funds and that $1,000 was paid to the respondent.  The respondent disputed the $31,140 paid for the car on the basis that the payment occurred after the separation and that it was solely for the benefit of the appellant in that the respondent could not drive.  Those submissions ignore that the residual value of the car was taken into account at trial and that the use of the car appears to be related to the telephone business and would otherwise be regarded as a reasonable living expense of the appellant.  Moreover, as the respondent conceded, she did not object to the purchase of the car (respondent's affidavit, 29 June 2011, pars 551 - 553).  I am satisfied that the $50,000 should not have been added back to the asset pool.
69The appellant sought to explain the expenditure of the $250,000.  On 8 May 2008, $10,000 was transferred to a joint operating account.  On 17 June 2008 $20,000 was paid to the respondent.  On 27 June 2008 $5,000 was paid to a joint account.  On 4 August 2008 $8,384 was taken by the appellant, by way of reimbursement for the payment by him of a joint tax bill.  None of those amounts were disputed by the respondent.  Accordingly, that $43,384 should not have been added back to the asset pool.
70The appellant explained the expenditure of the balance of $250,000 as follows.  On 4 August 2008 he withdrew $81,869 to reimburse himself for similar expenditure by the respondent.  On 22 January 2009 he withdrew a further $26,567 for the same purpose, i.e. a total of $108,436.  The respondent disputed the reasonableness of that reimbursement.  She submitted that there was no basis for the appellant reimbursing himself for monies which she was said to have spent in circumstances where he was able to work and was receiving money from the business, but she was not.  The respondent did not accept that the evidence at Black AB 229 constituted an admission that she had spent that much for personal living expenses.  She did not, however, proffer an alternative figure. She submitted that in the appellant's calculations of expenditure, he had claimed the joint tax liability of $8,384.95 twice.
71The evidence of the appellant in relation to the balance of the $250,000 is sparse.  He submitted that allowing for payments of interest, there was an amount of $127,000 remaining from the $250,000 as of March 2010.  On 6 September 2011 he transferred $52,712.65 to reimburse himself for making payments to meet joint expenses (affidavit, 2 September 2011, Blue AB 168G).  This left approximately $78,000 as at the date of trial, which was reduced to $10,000 as at the date of judgment.  In oral submissions on the appeal, senior counsel for the appellant explained that expenditure as follows:
""The difference between $78,000 and $10,000, there is no evidence as to how that was spent but in the history as set out above we say the only inference that's available would be that the money was used for joint expenses, not some unparticularised, unevidenced misuse of funds by the appellant.  There is no allegation against us that it was spent in some improper way.  That's the accounting.""  (AT 4.12.12 - 17.23 - .28)
72While that evidence was not challenged at trial, on the appeal the respondent submitted:
""The appellant says in his affidavit dated 2nd September 2011 that he transferred another $52,712.65 to reimburse himself for joint expenses (Blue 168H).  There was no accounting for this amount.  He paid some other amounts, totalling about $7,000 and said that he had made no other transactions.  The balance at the date of judgment should therefore have been about $60,000 but it was only about $10,000.
On the basis of these examples and the rough and ready accounting of the amounts allegedly spent by the respondent, the Court cannot be persuaded that the roughly $90,000 claimed should be credited to the appellant as being used for joint purposes.""
73The difficulty for this Court is that these issues were not explored at trial and his Honour did not deal with them.  That having been said, there is some force in the respondent's submissions that in respect to the  reduction of $127,000 to $10,000 between September 2011 and the date of judgment, no detail has been provided by the appellant of either the $52,000 or the reduction from $78,000 to $10,000.  
74In relation to the $108,000 with which the appellant reimbursed himself in August of 2008 and January of 2009, there is also some force in the respondent's submission that because he was in receipt of regular earnings from the telephone business, his need for personal expenditure from joint funds was not as great as that of the respondent.  Accordingly, while I would allow a reimbursement in favour of the appellant for his living expenses, that reimbursement should not necessarily be the same as the amount spent by the respondent for that purpose.
75On the state of the evidence, no precise calculations can be made.  The Court, of necessity, has to apply a broad brush approach.
76I have concluded, as the primary judge himself appreciated, that he was in error in adding back $300,000 to the asset pool.  In my opinion, justice would be done between the parties if $100,000 were to be added back to the asset pool.
Ground of Appeal 3:  The primary judge erred in finding that the respondent was under a disability within the meaning of s 52 of the Limitation Act 1969.
Ground of Appeal 4:  The primary judge ought to have found that the respondent's claim in respect of each of the alleged assaults that were held to be established (except for the found assault in 2007) were statute barred.
77The relevant sections of the LTA are:
""11(3) For the purposes of this Act a person is under a disability:...
(b)   while the person is, for a continuous period of twenty-eight days or upwards, incapable of, or substantially impeded in, the management of his or her affairs in relation to the cause of action in respect of the limitation period for which the question arises, by reason of:
(i)   any disease or any impairment of his or her physical or mental condition,
...""
""52   Disability
(1)  Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and subject to section 53, where:
(a)   a person has a cause of action,
(b)   the limitation period fixed by this Act for the cause of action has commenced to run, and
(c)   the person is under a disability,
in that case:
(d)   the running of the limitation period is suspended for the duration of the disability, and
(e)   if, but for this paragraph, the limitation period would expire before the lapse of three years after:
(i)   the date on which the person last (before the expiration of the limitation period) ceases to be under a disability, or
(ii)   the date of the person's death,
(whichever date is the earlier), the limitation period is extended so as to expire three years after the earlier of those dates.
(2)   This section applies whenever a person is under a disability, whether or not the person is under the same or another disability at any time during the limitation period....""
78Those sections were analysed in Guthrie v Spence [2009] NSWCA 369 by Campbell JA (with whom Basten JA and Handley AJA agreed).  There, his Honour said:
""Cause of Action
132 Section 11(3)(b) depends on a person being incapable of or substantially impeded in the management of his or her affairs ""in relation to the cause of action"".  But what is ""the cause of action""?
...
134 Notwithstanding that the expression ""cause of action"" has a central role to play in the Limitation Act, the Act does not define it.  ... 
138 The only places in the entire Act where the definition of ""disability"" in section 11(3)(b) has work to do is in section 52, and in related procedural provisions in section 53.  The usual way in which a definition operates in a statute is by providing a set of words in the definiens that can be used to replace the definiendum in an operative provision of the statute, to articulate more fully the meaning of that operative provision ...  If the defined meaning of ""disability"" is notionally read into section 52, the first place it applies is in section 52(1)(c).  When it is read into section 52(1)(c), ""the cause of action"" in section 11(3)(b) then refers back to section 52(1)(a) and (b).  In other words, it is a particular right to sue that a particular person has, and concerning which the limitation period fixed by the Act has commenced to run. 
""Management of His or Her Affairs""
139 The word ""affairs"" is one which is capable of a variety of meanings and can be quite broad. ... Without trying to be exhaustive, the management of a person's affairs can include the management of the whole range of practical matters of a business nature that that person is involved in. 
140 In the context in which it occurs in section 11(3)(b), the relevant ""affairs"" are ones in relation to a particular cause of action.  In a general sense, managing one's affairs in relation to a particular cause of action includes doing the various things that would need to be done if that cause of action were to be dealt with.  Thus, it includes seeking advice about whether a civil remedy exists for some perceived wrong, seeking advice about the difficulties, risks, cost and effort involved in pursuing any such remedy and the likely returns, comprehending and evaluating that advice, and, if the decision to commence proceedings is taken, thereafter engaging in the continuing process of co-operation, interaction and decision-making that exists between lawyer and client in running any civil action.
141 In deciding the meaning of ""affairs"" in section 11(3)(b), one must bear in mind that the context in which it occurs is that of the Limitation Act.  The sole concern of the Limitation Act is with the time within which an action must be commenced - anything that happens after an action has been commenced is irrelevant to it.  The Act prescribes various limitation periods for different types of causes of action.  The purpose of section 11(3) and section 52 is to identify circumstances in which it would always be just to allow the plaintiff a longer time within which to commence an action.  ...
...
143 Both these aspects of the context assist in concluding that the shade of meaning of ""affairs"" in section 11(3)(b) is one that places particular weight on the activities in relation to a cause of action leading up to and ending with the institution of proceedings.
""Substantially""
144 While I would not disagree with Slattery J's view in Kotulski at 117 that in section 11(3)(b) ""substantially"" ""does not mean trivial or minimal, neither does it mean total"", that still leaves open a wide range within which ""substantially impeded"" might fall.  I do not read Slattery J as saying that falling anywhere within that range would suffice.
...
152 In the present context, whether the plaintiff has been ""substantially"" impeded is decided bearing in mind the context and purpose for which the court is called on to make the decision.  It is for the purpose of deciding whether an as-of-right suspension of a limitation period will arise.  It needs to be an impediment that has interfered with the ability of the plaintiff to commence the action within time to an extent sufficient to warrant the suspension of the limitation period.
...
156 The wording of section 11(3)(b) is awkward when it uses the words ""management of his or her affairs in relation to the cause of action in respect of the limitation period for which the question arises"".  It is not immediately clear how the phrases ""in relation to the cause of action"" and ""in respect of the limitation period for which the question arises"" fit into the syntactical structure of the chapeau of section 11(3)(b).
158 The words ""in respect of the limitation period for which the question arises"" are fairly clearly an adjectival phrase, but what is the noun or noun phrase that they describe? It could not be ""cause of action"" - one has a limitation period in respect of a cause of action, but not a cause of action in respect of a limitation period.  It would make sense of the syntax if ""in respect of the limitation period for which the cause of action arises"" described ""affairs"" - one's affairs in respect of a limitation period would be those practical matters that needed to be attended to concerning the limitation period.  They would involve doing those things one needed to do to be able to bring an action within the limitation period.  However, reading the section that way would require the insertion of an ""and"", so that the section read ""management of his or her affairs in relation to the cause of action and in respect of the limitation period for which the question arises"".  While the process of construction can proceed by reading a word into a statutory provision, it is preferable to avoid doing so if possible.
159 A meaning that is the same as I have just been considering will arise if the syntax is analysed so that ""in respect of the limitation period for which the question arises"" is an adjectival phrase that describes the noun phrase ""affairs in relation to the cause of action"".  So regarded, ""in respect of the limitation period for which the question arises"" serves to divide off, from the whole ambit of a person's affairs in relation to a cause of action, those affairs that are in respect of the limitation period for which the question arises.  Reading section 11(3)(b) as having that syntax would advance the purpose for which section 11(3)(b) exists.  It is readily understandable policy that a limitation period should continue to be suspended while a plaintiff is substantially impeded in dealing with those practical matters that need to be attended to for the action to be brought in time.
160 In my view, that is the correct syntactical structure of section 11(3)(b).  Its having that syntax enables one to advance from the conclusion reached by analysis of the meaning of ""affairs"", namely that the shade of the meaning of ""affairs"" in section 11(3)(b) is one that places particular weight on the activities in relation to the cause of action leading up to and ending with the institution of proceedings, and to conclude that the only ""affairs"" that are referred to by section 11(3)(b) are those practical matters that lead up to and end with the institution of proceedings for the particular cause of action in question.
161 It is also readily understandable policy that not every matter that substantially impeded the plaintiff in dealing with the practical matters that needed to be attended to enable the action to be brought in time should justify an extension of time.  Bad legal advice, an inattentive lawyer, or having other pressing family or business commitments could each provide a reason why the plaintiff was substantially impeded in bringing an action in time, but it would be understandable legislative policy not to allow those to provide a reason for automatic suspension of a limitation period.  The same might also be the case for significant poverty.  There may be a measure of arbitrariness in the circumstances listed in subparas (i)-(iv) as adequate ones to provide the reason why a substantial impediment in management of the relevant affairs is treated as suspending a limitation period, but that is the choice that the legislature has made.""79With that as background, it is necessary to examine more closely the basis on which his Honour concluded that the respondent should have the benefit of s52 LTA.
80His Honour noted that when considering whether the respondent suffered from a disability of the necessary kind, he had to consider not only the assaults and batteries which he found to have occurred, but the whole of the relationship as it existed between the parties between 1993 and 2007.  Matters which did not constitute an assault might still be relevant to medical opinion relating to the respondent's disability.  His Honour rejected a diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  That finding has not been challenged by either party.  His Honour rejected the evidence of Dr Kraushaar, the psychologist, as to diagnosis on the basis that this was beyond his speciality.  That finding has also not been challenged. 
81The competing opinions which his Honour had to consider were those of Dr Robert Fisher, a consultant psychiatrist, who was retained on behalf of the respondent, and Dr Peter Klug, a forensic psychiatrist, retained by the appellant.  The respondent had first consulted Dr Fisher on 5 January 2010 for treatment purposes.  He provided a report, dated 11 January 2010, in relation to that consultation.  Thereafter, he saw her for medico legal purposes on 15 June 2011 at the request of her solicitors.  He prepared a report dated 30 June 2011 and gave evidence in the proceedings.  Dr Klug saw the respondent on 5 April and 12 May 2011 and prepared reports dated 2 June, 30 June, 8 August and 16 August 2011.  He also gave evidence in the proceedings.  It should be noted that Dr Kraushaar accompanied the respondent when she was seen by Dr Klug and was present throughout the consultations.  Both Dr Fisher and Dr Klug were referred to the provisions of the LTA when preparing their reports. 
82Having been posed a question in terms of s52  LTA, Dr Fisher expressed his conclusion as follows (RAB 220G, Blue AB 765K):
""1. It is my view, that, to a significant extent, Mrs Mulcahy was in ""thrall"" to Mr Cooper, whom she had found charming and good company and pleasant initially to her children and initially a good sexual partner, but who, over a passage of months, from the beginning of their relationship, demonstrated himself to be jealous of her relationship with her two sons, extremely needy of attention, irracible and then increasingly, with the passage of time, was allegedly verbally abusive in the extreme, prone to using the worst expletives in the English lexicon and threatening her with physical violence and, again, allegedly, as pointed out in her affidavit, subjecting her to physical violence at times and, in the context of owning two rifles, engendering in her a realistically based fear of a potential threat to her life.""
83In that report, Dr Fisher likened the condition of the respondent to that of the ""battered woman"" where the abuser is sorry after the event and the abused person stays in the relationship in order to keep the family together.  Dr Fisher concluded (RAB 220T, Blue AB 765T):
""I believe there is clear evidence that most of these elements have had their part to play in Mrs Mulcahy's decision to stay on in the relationship, made worse by her decreasing sense of self-confidence, attractiveness and capacity to live a life alone.
So, I do believe that Mrs Mulcahy was suffering from a disability according to the definition of ""disability"" provided by section 52.
2. I believe that her primary condition was a mixed anxiety depressive syndrome induced by Mr Cooper's stress-producing verbal and physical abuse, which manifested insidiously initially and then became more profound with the passage of time.
I believe that, in this state, Mrs Mulcahy's confidence and her ability to assert herself was so significantly impaired, and she had become so pathologically dependent on Mr Cooper, that she was not capable, on the balance of probabilities, of making rationial decisions about whether or not to stay with him, whether or not to report his abusive behaviour to police.
3. I believe, on the balance of probabilities, that from the earliest time in the relationship, she was substantially impeded in her ability to manage her affairs ...""
At RAB 221P, Blue AB 766P:
""It is my view that Mrs Mulcahy experienced an insidious deterioration in her capacity to assert herself in this very unequal relationship with Mr Cooper and, in her increasingly anxious and depressed and unconfident state, was not able to take a stand against what was extreme and unreasonable behaviour.  I believe that it is only since she separated from Mr Cooper that she was able to fully appreciate the extent and severity of his abusive behaviour, but I do believe that this persisted down to the time that Mrs Mulcahy was in fact able to obtain legal advice and an understanding of, and ability to pursue, her rights, in respect of the assaults and battery.""
At RAB 22F, Blue AB 767H:
""I have already indicated that I believe that Mrs Mulcahy became so anxious and depressed and lacking in self-confidence, remaining ""in thrall"" of Mr Cooper, that she was not able to think rationally about the situation she found herself in, or to assert herself appropriately by either leaving Mr Cooper, seeking an AVO, or reporting him to the police and having him charged with assault and battery.
...
I believe, on the balance of probabilities, that she was caught up in a particular frame of mind, desperately hoping that the relationaship would be salvagable and that the once charming and considerate de facto husband would once again display such apparent loving and considerate behaviour.  The fact that, during her time with him, she experienced a degree of intermittent reinforcement of the idea that he was a suitable companion, by demonstrating care and expressing a wish to re-engage with her, even after the various periods of separation, that she was caught up emotionally in the hope that such a meaningful resumption of the original style of relationship would occur.""
84Dr Klug reached a different conclusion (RAB 223M, Blue AB 697L):
""My opinion is that Ms Mulcahy is not suffering from any severe psychiatric condition.  She certainly has not been suffering from a chronic post traumatic stress disorder or a major depressive disorder.  She has probably suffered at times from an adjustment disorder.  An adjustment disorder is not a major mood disturbance but is nevertheless a significant psychiatric entity characterised by excessive distress and/or dysfunction in response to a specific stressor or stressors.  If Ms Mulcahy has suffered from an adjustment disorder (chronic or intermittent) it would need to be specified what the stressors were that induced this condition.  To my knowledge, and from the history Ms Mulcahy provided at interview, there has been no exposure to traumatic stressors.  I note she is being medicated with an anti depressant and a minor tranquilisor and this is compatible with the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder.""
Blue AB 707E:
""I do not believe the condition of a recurrent adjustment disorder has had any effect on Ms Mulcahy's ability to manage her affairs in relation to the cause of action of assault and battery.
Her condition of a recurrent adjustment disorder, in my view, did not render her incapable of, or being substantially impeded in, the management of her affairs in relation to the alleged assaults or batteries inflicted upon her.""
85In response to Dr Fisher's report, Dr Klug said (Blue AB 721V):
""It should be stated at the outset, that there are inherent difficulties in being a treating psychiatrist who then provides an independent forensic assessment.
It is of considerable interest that in Dr Fisher's first report of 11 January 2010, when he assessed her as a treating psychiatrist, that he did not diagnose any major psychiatric illness.  To the contrary, he described her as ""quite stressed"" but ""not depressed"".  He notes that there were no features of severe depression.  He however describes features of anxiety.  He notes that Ms Mulcahy felt stressed by the legal action.  He also notes that she is a worrier by nature.  He notes that she was upset about Bob Cooper never really liking her sons and she said the marriage started to break down in late 2006.  His opinion that her psychiatric symptomology is mild is one with which I concur in my previous report.
In his report of 30 June 2011, when he carried out a forensic psychiatric assessment, Dr Fisher's opinion is very different.  He notes she suffers from a possible chronic post traumatic stress disorder, which is partially ameliorated and a major depressive disorder in remission.  He also notes that she has some obsessional personality traits and some features of passive dependent personality functioning. ...""
(Blue AB 722N):
""Dr Fisher states, in other parts of this report, that Ms Mulcahy is suffering from ""a mixed anxiety depressive syndrome"".  This, however, is not reflected in his multi-axial diagnostic formulation.  A mixed anxiety depressive syndrome is not a diagnostic category in the DSM-IV-TR ...""
(Blue AB 723JH):
""He also refers to Ms Mulcahy's inability to assert herself and her becoming ""so pathalogically dependent on Mr Cooper, that she was not capable, on the bounds of probability, of making rational decisions ...""  On Axis 2 of his multi-axial diagnostic formulation Dr Fisher notes that Ms Mulcahy has ""some features of passive dependent personality functioning"".  Axis 2 is reserved for the diagnosis of personality dysfunction or disorder.  His reference to her being pathalogically dependent on Mr Cooper is, therefore, likely to be a long standing trait, which predated her forming a relationship with Mr Cooper.  Personality characteristics, by definition, are formed at the completion of adolescence.
In conclusion, the following points should be noted:
1. There are inherent difficulties in being a treating psychiatrist who then declares himself as an independent forensic assessing psychiatrist.
2. Dr Fisher diagnoses Ms Mulcahy as having a possible post traumatic stress disorder in partial remission and a major depressive disorder in remission but then also diagnoses her as suffering from a mixed anxiety depressive syndrome, which is not a diagnostic category in the DMS-IV-TR.  This is a confusing use of terminology.
3. Despite regarding her psychiatric conditions as being in partial or full remission, Dr Fisher, nevertheless, regards her as suffering from a disability according to section 52 and being substantially impeded in her ability to manage her affairs.  This seems to be incompatible with his diagnoses, which he states are in partial or full remission.
4. The symptoms he describes as a treating psychiatrist are mild and would barely qualify for the diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder but in this further report, as a forensic psychiatrist, he diagnoses her with two possibly three major psychiatric disorders.  The discrepancy between these two assessments is substantial and is difficult to fathom.
5. It is also of note that Dr Fisher comments on her intermittent, long term, low quantity marijuana use and experimentation with cocaine and magic mushrooms.  Dr Fisher does not consider that poly drug abuse might play a role in her presentation and he does not interestingly, include it as a primary psychiatric diagnosis on Axis 1.
In summary, there is nothing in the further documentation by Dr Fisher to justify any change in my opinion.  I do not believe Ms Mulcahy is suffering from a disability under the relevant section.  I do not believe she is, or has been, suffering from a major psychiatric disorder but may have suffered from a recurrent adjustment disorder.  The terms ""battered woman"" and ""battered wife syndrome"" are in my view, not appropriately applied to Ms Mulcahy given that there is no connotation of severe psychiatric illness.""
86In relation to the criticism by Dr Klug of Dr Fisher's diagnosis of ""mixed anxiety depressive syndrome"", the following question and answer was given when Dr Fisher was giving evidence in chief at Black AB 455F (also at RAB 224G):
""Q.  In that report Dr Klug seeks to criticise your diagnosis by stating that mixed anxiety depressive syndrome is not to be found in DSM-IV.  What is your comment on that statement?A.  Strictly speaking, he is correct, it isn't found in the diagnostic entity in DSM-IV.  It is found in the preliminary drafts of DSM-V which is the successor of DSM-IV.  In reality people have argued very strongly that this is a useful way of charactering the sort of disorder I believe Ms Mulcahy suffered from because there is such a mixture of anxiety and depression which describes what the patient is experiencing.  Furthermore, it may have idealogical implications.  In other words, often enough severe depression is preceded by being very stressed and anxious.  One of the aims of the DSM system is to try and put things into categories that can be tested and can end up understanding causes by virtue of that classification or we find out what we classify as separate entities are the same entities.  There is some scientific and logical basis to this approach.  So in summary the term ""mixed anxiety depression"" is something many people working in psychiatry would use as a diagnosis and is about to become an official diagnosis in DSM-V and Dr Klug is correct it is not in the current literature.  He is correct in that.  I think the point I am making qualifies why I am putting it in.""
87His Honour regarded that explanation as acceptable.  While minds might differ as to whether that response is an acceptable explanation of the diagnosis, it is the only comment which the primary judge made in relation to the serious criticisms which Dr Klug made of Dr Fisher's diagnosis.
88At RAB 224Q, the primary judge said:
""264 Some things about the parties' relationship raise doubts about whether Dr Fischer's conclusions may be correct. Obvious ones are the fact that the defendant was a relatively high functioning individual throughout the relationship and another is the long periods of time between the assaults. In the plaintiff's submissions in reply he makes the following points:
""7.6  The point made at paragraph 154 of the earlier submissions which goes totally unremarked upon in the Defendant's submissions that a period of more than six years passes between the allegation at item 9 of the schedule of alleged assaults occurring in the Christmas/New Year period of 2000/2001 and the next chronological allegation which is item 3 occurring in March/April 2007. This fact comprehensively debunks the repeated suggestions of the Defendant's submissions that there is some ""continuum"" of abuse. 
7.7  The impressive list of examples of conduct of the Defendant which demonstrate a lack of fear or intimidation including (in addition to the matters mentioned above):
7.7.1  Camping in seemingly remote places; T354.28
7.7.2  Choosing to live in the isolated location at South Bank Road. It is instructive to consider just some of the evidence on this aspect. The evidence of the Defendant herself starting at T215.04 that, at least at the time of the purchase of South Bank Road in late 1999 and the farm in late 2003: 
(a) she had no concerns about living there with the Plaintiff; 
(b)  this in circumstances where she was dependent on him to drive her anywhere away from the property; and
(c)  at T217.11, at the time the parties were looking to purchase the South Bank property (in late 1999), she had no concerns about her personal safety or physical situation;
7.7.3  Pressing the Plaintiff to live at South Bank Road despite his initial lack of interest in purchasing that property;
7.7.4  The fact that she went shooting with the Plaintiff with a spotlight; T341.19
7.7.5  The dealings with Gaythorne and the purchase by the MFT of the Mitchelton property to assist David's wife buy a different house;
7.7.6  The pay out of the River Road loan after the Plaintiff had expressly declined to sign the documents required to be signed in this regard (see par 50.9 of the earlier submissions, par 502 of the Defendant's Affidavit of 29 June 2011 and T183.4);
7.7.7  The secret rental receipts from River Road and related CBA accounts;
7.7.8  The trip to Vanuatu in late 2007 post the date the Defendant alleges for separation;
7.7.9.  The trip to Bribie Island;
7.7.10. Her control of the $55,000 loan to Wade (David Mulcahy's evidence was that he was not involved with this loan (T437.17 to 21) nor knew the details of the rent receipts of River Road (T417.47 to 418.09 and 427.18 to 36) and Wade Mulcahy's evidence was also that he did not know the details of the rent receipts of River Road (T113.22 to 31), which evidences the degree of involvement in these matters of the Defendant;
7.7.11  Her control and separateness in keeping the inheritance account.  It should be noted that the inheritance was a modest amount of some $16,000, so that there is no credence in the suggestion by the Defendant that there is a basis for the separateness of these monies."" 
89His Honour considered that those submissions by the appellant had been adequately answered by the responses of Dr Fisher under cross-examination (Red 225V - G).  In order to understand the responses, and his Honour's assessment of them, it is necessary to set out the whole of the exchange which is at Black AB 472P-474D:
""Q.  In terms of post traumatic stress disorder, the diagnosis that we get from the manual would indicate that it relates to death, horrific type injuries that someone either experiences or sees and sees in respect of someone who is a good friend or member of family, or I take it a third category, which is someone who is constantly threatened and in fear of life during that period of time, is that right?A. Yes, it is.
Q. Is that -A. I think that's a very fair account for a non-psychiatrist.
Q. In respect of an incident where someone is taken by an arm down a flight of stairs at the rear of a house, where they are not taken off their feet, that is not knocked off their feet, they are not injured, ordinarily that incident would not fall within the type of incident in the first and second categories, would it? A. No, not in the first or second.
Q. It could be part of -A. The third.
Q.  - the third, I take it? A.  Yes.
Q. And in respect of an incident that involved alcohol being poured over someone's head, on one occasion that of itself wouldn't be said to fall within categories 1 or 2, would it? A. I wouldn't think so.
Q. It may be only considered as part of the category 3 of ongoing threats. Is that right?A. Latent threat.
Q. Latent threat. And the threat is of the person being killed or seriously injured?A. It is.
Q. Were you given a number of the number of assaults that you were asked to assume? Or the threats of assault, I should say. A. I don't recollect being given a number.
Q. But I take it that you assumed that it was in the hundreds? A. Not of physical threats, not of ""I'm going to punch you now"".
Q. Not of threats -A. But words were of a threatening nature, like, ""I know people in Sydney who could take care of you.""
Q. With the recipient thinking that they might be killed or seriously injured? A. Yes, plus the context of the husband - de facto husband possessing two rifles, which raises the stakes in terms of potential dangerousness.
Q.  Now, if I can attempt to use my words, but if you could express it better; that is, the conversation from a person posing the threat has to be such as to put the person in fear when received by the recipient? A. Yes, it would need to be of that order.
Q. And in terms of the third category, those incidents would need to be constant, I think, is the word you used in the report. That is, there's this constant apprehension of being killed, maimed, or persons close to them being killed or maimed. Is that so? A. Yes, it is.
Q. And if there were periods of many years without these incidents, that would be relevant to your assessment of the illness if there were periods of time where there were normal behaviour?A. Well, interestingly, it actually generally works in the obverse way to that because what we know is that intermittent reinforcement in behaviour therapy is the most powerful way of reinforcing an idea or a feeling. So if indeed the acts - the actual acts of violence are unpredictable but do occur intermittently, then that is more likely to engender fear and a sense of impotence in the face of the ongoing situation than where there are mild degrees of assault happening very regularly and predictably.""
90In relation to that part of the appellant's submissions at trial, which related to the high functionality of the respondent, his Honour referred to other oral evidence of Dr Fisher (Red 226H - 227D) (Black AB 482K - W):
""Q.  Sorry, doctor, there is a matter Mr Priestley has reminded me.  In respect of managing her affiars, that is Mrs Mulcahy's affairs, in terms of the history where she was involved with real estate and with various businesses of the parties during the relationship, and continued to do so up until separation; that is able to deal with banks on her own behalf or whatever.  She, in those circumstances, can I suggest to you, appear to have any disability in reporting matters or making complaint in respect of what she now complains of in affidavits as to how she was abused.  What I am suggesting to you is, she, throughout the time of the relationship, was able to hold her own and appear to operate as a normal person would in a relationship with its normal ups and downs.  That's not your understanding?A.  Well, I think clearly to make it simplistic or we can try and tease out the various factors that have contributed to this complex situation.  I guess the most important thing in my mind is, where it came to doing things that involved strongly asserting herself against a man whom she felt ambivalent about did she make a sensible decision, such as taking out an AVO; no, she didn't as far as I know.  Did not make that sensible decision, despite being advised to do so.  So, the concept of being in thrall to someone implies that when it comes to matters that have to do with either saying things or doing things that could harm the other, which logically she should have done on the basis of what she is telling us she didn't do it.  Why not?  To try and understand why not is part of the psychology of the whole situation.  Why did she not do the sensible thing?
Q.  And there is an answer to this.  That is she has exaggerated or taken out of context matters that have happened in her relationship for financial gain?A.  Well, the things she reports to me that were said to her and done strike me as being beyond the normal, beyond the healthy.  As I tried to allude to previously, she didn't seem to me to take the opportunity to grossly exaggerate things when she could have.""
91The primary judge set out his conclusions on those issues as follows:
""267 These responses seem to me to [be] quite reasonable. It should not be forgotten that a lot of the abuse is said to be continuous, see the evidence in respect of the abusive language in 1993. Exhibit P in the proceedings is a collection of emails between the parties after separation. They contain many emails from the defendant using expletives and direct sexual references which made Dr Fischer blush. This is put forward to play down the effect of the language used by the plaintiff.  However it seems to me that they are in a limited time frame and probably said in the protective environment of emails and distance between the parties.""  (RAB 227D - J)
92The emails which comprised Exhibit P were voluminous.  They are at Blue AB 438 - 678.  They cover the period November 2007 to October 2008.  A reading of the emails makes clear why they were tendered.  As the primary judge pointed out, the expletives used by the respondent in these emails match, if not exceed, anything found to have been said by the appellant.  Not only does the respondent consistently use those expletives throughout the exchange of emails, but they are used in a way and context which strongly suggests that this was the way in which the respondent normally communicated with the appellant.  They are frequently mixed with terms of endearment.  I should also observe that there is no basis in the evidence for his Honour's observation ""However, it seems to me that they are in a limited timeframe and probably said in the protective environment of emails and distance between the parties"".  This was an entirely speculative conclusion.
93His Honour preferred the opinion of Dr Fisher and rejected that of Dr Klug for the following reasons:
""268 But what of the contrary opinion of Dr Klug? His interview with the defendant was made difficult in that she continually referred him to her affidavit instead of answering his enquiries about any assaults. He described the results in these terms:

""On specific and persistent enquiry about the history of assaults in the relationship, despite describing difficulties in the relationship and verbal abuse from Mr. Cooper, she said he had never physically assaulted her. There is one episode when she said she was ""dragged"" when he grabbed her by the arm and marched her down a set of stairs. Specifically however, there were no other incidents of physical aggression, according to Ms. Mulcahy's history at interview.  There is also no history of sexual violence. When I persisted further along this line of enquiry she simply stated that she found it very difficult to talk about the situation and could not give me an answer. She referred me to her affidavit.""

269 It seems that Dr Klug has proceeded on the basis that although he has read the affidavit he places no great reliance on it in contrast to what little he elicited in the interview. For example there is no reference in his report to the threats to shoot or maim. There could be several reasons for her attitude.  She may have wished to be non-cooperative or she may have had a real difficulty in reliving the events again in the telling process.  I think the latter is more likely.  
270 Having regard to these matters and the other matters appearing in the cross examination I prefer the evidence of Dr Fischer to that of Dr Klug on this aspect.""  (RAB 227K - 228C)
94The basis for the primary judge's conclusion in favour of Dr Fisher is not further explained.  This is despite the considerable detail provided by Dr Klug in his report as to the difficulties he had in eliciting information from the respondent (Blue AB 687P - 689F).  These were the same difficulties identified by his Honour when assessing the credibility of the respondent ([29] - [30] hereof)  Importantly, his Honour did not set out the balance of the quotation from Dr Klug, which is to be found in his report of 2 June 2011 at Blue AB 696B-J.  Following the quotation set out above, Dr Klug said:
""There does not appear to be a firm history of what might be described as psychological abuse in the long term de facto marriage with Robert Cooper.  Certainly, there appears to have been marital friction and it is possible that Ms Mulcahy adopted a passive stance in the relationship.  I am aware that psychological abuse might be regarded as the genesis of what has been termed the ""battered person syndrome"".  This is a term that has been used in the ICD (International Classification of Diseases) system of diagnosis.  This condition is essentially compatible with that of a post traumatic stress disorder, but is also associated with repeated cycles of violence and reconciliation, which is associated with false and self-recriminatory beliefs on the part of the victim.  It is also regarded as being associated with the victim fearing for her life or the lives of her children.  This does not appear to be compatible with the history that Ms Mulcahy provided.""
95His Honour's conclusion in favour of the application of s52 to the respondent's claims for assault and battery was as follows:
""271 In my view the disability would have commenced after the events in 1993 and continued until a time shortly after the commencement of the proceedings in the Statement of Claim, August 2008, when she started to respond to the claim. The limitation period is therefore suspended, by reason of her disability, until this time. ..."" (RAB 228J - L)
96The appellant submitted that the findings by the primary judge based on the opinion of Dr Fisher, were not open.  He relied on what was said in Paric v John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 58; 59 ALJR 844.  There the Court (Mason ACJ, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ) confirmed the principle that it was an error to rely upon the opinions of an expert medical witness if those opinions were not based on assumptions and hypotheses established by the evidence.
97The appellant submitted that whereas the primary judge had extensively quoted the opinions of Dr Fisher, he had not sought to relate those conclusions to the evidence on which they were said to be based.  This was despite the appellant's submissions at trial to the effect that there was a substantial disconnect between what the respondent said about the relationship and her actions while the relationship was on foot and the inferences which could be properly drawn from those actions.  The appellant relied on the summary of evidence at RAB 224-225 (see [88] - [89] hereof).  
98The appellant submitted that neither his Honour nor Dr Fisher had properly taken into account that the respondent had chosen to live in an isolated location at Southbank Road in 1999, that she did so in circumstances where he was not particularly enthusiastic and that she had no concerns about living there with him, even though she was dependent upon him to drive if she wished to leave the property.  The appellant submitted that the respondent's asserted fear apparently brought about by his reference to his rifles, sat uneasily with her willingness to go spotlight shooting with him.  The appellant submitted that nowhere did either Dr Fisher nor the primary judge deal with the respondent's control of her own financial affairs.  The appellant referred in particular to the sophisticated financial scheme with her son David while the relationship was still on foot, which was designed to transfer the proceeds of sale of the Gaythorne and Mitchelton properties to David and his wife.  As a result of this scheme, the Mulcahy Family Trust borrowed $500,000 which was used by David to buy a $1 million property in the name of his wife without the appellant's knowledge.  The scheme is summarised at Red 132D-W.
99There is considerable force in this submission.
100There was no basis in fact for Dr Fisher's conclusion that ""the physical violence started"" in 1993 and continued throughout the relationship.  As the respondent confirmed, there were only two instances of physical violence over 14 years and these were of a very low level.  They consisted of grabbing by the arm and pulling down a stairway and pouring beer over the respondent's head.  Dr Fisher's conclusions as to the commencement of the respondent's disability and its amelioration after the relationship ceased are arbitrary and contradictory.
101The only other violence relied upon was that which was described by Dr Fisher as ""constant"" and ""extreme"" verbal abuse.  One could envisage a situation where constant verbal abuse, involving the use of expletives, could amount to violence but that was not the situation here.  The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the emails in Exhibit P was that the respondent was an habitual user of expletives and sexually direct language.  Without further evidence, it was not open to conclude that such a person would be offended when that kind of language was used by someone else in her presence, whether or not it was specifically directed to her.  The treatment of this evidence by the primary judge (at RAB 227H-J) was not only superficial but involved speculation on his part which was not open on the evidence.  
102The assumption by Dr Fisher that the ""verbal abuse"" was ""constant"", cannot be reconciled with the evidence.  While it is not necessary in a case covering a 14 year relationship that every incident be described, rolled up expressions such as ""constant"" without specific illustrations and some supporting evidence are unhelpful.  Eleven instances of abuse over a 14 year period were relied upon.  None of them involved a direct threat of violence.  At most, some involved a conditional threat, e.g. ""don't be here when I get back"".  If one discounts the use of expletives by the appellant, on the basis that this was unlikely to have shocked or upset the respondent, the eleven instances relied upon by the respondent, and described by the primary judge, do not amount to ""constant threats of physically assaulting her and her children"".
103In particular, the six year period between Christmas 2000 and the assault in mid 2007, was not explained by Dr Fisher and was not properly taken into account by the primary judge.  The explanation by Dr Fisher which his Honour took as a complete answer to that evidence (at RAB 225U-G) is not only surprising but verges on the absurd.  The proposition which was put was that if acts of violence are unpredictable but do occur intermittently, that is more likely to engender fear than if there were assaults happening regularly and predictably.  While as a general proposition that might be supportable, it has no relationship to the facts of this case.  It cannot apply where there were only ever two low-level acts of physical violence and no identified physical violence or verbal assaults between those occasions for a period in excess of six years.  
104A conclusion drawn by Dr Fisher, which is not borne out by the facts, is that the respondent was living in constant fear of physical violence and the threat that the appellant might use his rifles against her, or her sons.  Such a conclusion is inconsistent with two low level episodes of violence occurring over 14 years.  It is inconsistent with the content of the threats found by his Honour to have occurred on two occasions concerning the rifles.  No mention was made of the sons.  Taking the threats at their highest, they were not direct but were conditional and qualified.  The last of the threats was found to have occurred in mid 2007 towards the end of the relationship.  Over a 14 year period, that is an insufficient factual basis for such a broad conclusion.  
105An important part of Dr Fisher's conclusions was that the respondent was ""in thrall"" of the appellant.  He did not define what he meant by that term.  In his oral evidence, he did provide some partial explanation.  At Black AB 480S in the context of trying to explain how his theory could stand with the fact that the respondent went on holidays with the appellant after the final separation, Dr Fisher said:
""A.  That's why I used the word ""in thrall"" because I think that it does encompass the very things that you're describing: despite the danger, keeps going back for more.  I wouldn't call it healthy.""
106Later, when asked to set out the facts upon which he based his opinion, Dr Fisher said:
""So I took into account the history provided of this regular and continuous and drawn out unpleasantness that existed between the two of them; the report by Mrs Mulcahy that she felt that she was suffering abuse and her subjective experience of it; and despite that, she continued in the relationship; she re-engaged in attempts at reconciliation and she did not take out an AVO when other people did advise her to do so and I think that the unifying explanation for that is that she was in thrall of Mr Cooper.  She held ambivalent feelings, she was strongly attracted to him on the one hand and not happy with his treatment of her on the other hand, and the events unfolded in that context.  I don't see it as being a normal reasonable piece of behaviour and I don't think that DSM is going to help us to understand that.  But the understanding of human psychological dynamics will.""  (Black AB 486E)
107The fundamental premise of the opinion that she remained in the relationship ""despite the danger"" is not made out on the evidence.  Over 14 years there had been two examples of low level violence and some intermittent threats, none of which had been implemented.  What the factual background supports and Dr Klug found, was a volatile relationship which the respondent wished to maintain and did so over 14 years, despite its ups and downs.  A matter which Dr Fisher ignores but is significant in the relationship, is that it was the appellant who was threatening to leave and did in fact leave the relationship on a number of occasions.  It was he who brought the relationship to an end by leaving.  At no time in the evidence is there a threat made by the respondent to the appellant to leave the relationship.  The clear inference is that the respondent wanted the relationship to continue despite its volatile nature.
108That is not, as Dr Fisher asserted, indicative of an unhealthy relationship.  The use of terms by Dr Fisher, such as ""the Stockholm Syndrome"" and the ""Battered Wife Syndrome"" are needlessly emotive and inaccurate descriptors of this relationship.  The inappropriateness of such terms was made clear by Dr Klug (see [94] hereof).  When Dr Fisher identified as a sign of an unhealthy relationship the unwillingness of the respondent to go to the police or seek an AVO, one has to ask what would be the basis of such an application?  There is nothing in the evidence which would justify police intervention, nor is there anything which would justify an AVO.
109A matter relied upon by the appellant in submissions at trial and on appeal, and which was raised by Dr Klug, was the discrepancy between the history taken by Dr Fisher and his diagnosis when he first saw the respondent as a treating psychiatrist, and the history and diagnosis which he recorded after seeing her for medico-legal purposes.  As Dr Klug noted (see [85] hereof), when Dr Fisher first saw the respondent he did not diagnose any major psychiatric illness.  When he saw her for medico-legal purposes, one might think that he was describing a different person.  There is, accordingly, considerable force in the appellant's submission that in these proceedings, Dr Fisher was acting more as an advocate than as an expert witness seeking to assist the Court.  The primary judge did not address that issue.
110The basis upon which his Honour preferred the evidence of Dr Fisher to that of Dr Klug was flawed.  The considerations relevant to the assessment of expert evidence were set out in Wiki v Atlantis Relocations (NSW) Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 174; 60 NSWLR 127 where Ipp JA (with whom Bryson JA and Stein AJA agreed) said:
""61 But, where the issue in dispute involves differences between expert witnesses that are capable of being resolved rationally by examination and analysis, and where the experts are properly qualified and none has been found to be dishonest, or misleading, or unduly partisan, or otherwise unreliable, a decision based solely on demeanour will not provide the losing party with a satisfactory explanation for his or her lack of success.  A justifiable grievance as to the way in which justice was administered will then arise.
62 In Moylan, Sheller JA (with whom Beazley JA and Giles JA agreed) referred to and adopted much of the reasoning of Henry LJ in Flannery. His Honour quoted the following remarks of Henry LJ (reported in Flannery at 381-382) with approval:
""It is not a useful task to attempt to make absolute rules as to the requirement for the judge to give reasons.  This is because issues are so infinitely various.  For instance, when the court, in a case without documents depending on eye witness accounts is faced with two irreconcilable accounts, there may be little to say other than that the witnesses for one side were more credible ... But with expert evidence, it should usually be possible to be more explicit in giving reasons:  See Bingham LJ in Eckersley v Binnie (1988) 18 Con LR 1, 77-78:
""In resolving conflicts of expert evidence, the judge remains the judge; he is not obliged to accept evidence simply because it comes from an illustrious source; he can take account of demonstrated partisanship and lack of objectivity.  But, save where an expert is guilty of a deliberate attempt to mislead (as happens only very rarely), a coherent reasoned opinion expressed by a suitably qualified expert should be the subject of a coherent reasoned rebuttal, unless it can be discounted for other good reasons ...""""
And:
""[w]here the dispute involves something in the nature of an intellectual exchange, with reasons and analysis advanced on either side, the judge must enter into the issues canvassed before him and explain why he prefers one case over the other.""
63 Sheller JA (at [64]) criticised the trial judge in Moylan for deciding the case virtually solely on the strength of the following remarks:
""I have had the advantage not only of hearing the various witnesses give evidence but also of seeing the way in which they have reacted to the questions that they were asked.  Having done so, I prefer the expert evidence that was given for the defendants to that which was given for the plaintiffs.""""
(The reference to Moylan is a reference to Moylan v Nutrasweet Co [2000] NSWCA 337.)
111That engagement with the competing opinions of the psychiatrists did not take place.  Had the primary judge properly analysed the expert evidence of Dr Klug and Dr Fisher, it would have been apparent that the conclusions of Dr Klug were based on the facts as disclosed by the evidence, whereas those of Dr fisher were not.  Since his Honour did not reject the evidence of Dr Klug on demeanour grounds, there is nothing to stop this Court taking his opinion into account.
112The respondent submitted that his Honour was entitled to substantially disregard the evidence that the respondent was a ""high functioning"" person in respect of many aspects of her life when considering the application of s52 LTA.  She submitted that a person might be competent in many aspects of their life, but still be substantially impeded in their capacity to commence a particular sort of litigation.  The respondent relied upon Saunders and Anor v Jackson [2009] NSWCA 192 to support that submission.
113In that case, with the concurrence of Ipp and Macfarlan JJA, I said:
""48 The fact that the opponent's mental condition fluctuated between a ""major depressive illness"" and a ""low grade level of depression with little interest in enjoyment of life"" over the years is not decisive.  The fact that she was able to maintain employment and raise two children (although it is clear that she received considerable help from her mother in that regard) is also not decisive.  From the psychiatric evidence it was well open to her Honour to find, as she did, that the opponent was substantially impeded by her mental condition in the management of her affairs in relation to the cause of action.  Such a conclusion was not only open to her Honour but was clearly correct.  This is particularly so when to commence and maintain the cause of action required in the circumstances of this case, such a difficult and emotional decision by the opponent with potentially devastating repercussions for her family.""
114The facts in Saunders were, as the respondent conceded, quite different to those in this case.  The cause of action arose from sexual and physical assaults which took place over nine years when the plaintiff was aged between six and fifteen.  The assaults were committed by the plaintiff's eldest sister and her boyfriend.  There was unanimous psychiatric evidence that the plaintiff was suffering from severe depression, requiring admissions to hospital.  There was independent evidence as to her parlous emotional state over the years.
115The consequences of bringing proceedings were also significantly more serious in Saunders:
""44 A consideration of this question must have regard to the nature of the particular cause of action.  This was not an industrial accident or a motor vehicle accident where a decision whether or not to commence and continue with an action is relatively straightforward.  The cause of action alleged sexual assault by a family member over many years in the context of a family with considerable prestige in the community and with a distinguished association with the police force.
45 It would take a person of exceptional robustness and strength of character to pursue such a claim in the civil courts even if that person were not suffering from an impairment of her mental condition.""
116It is true, as the respondent undoubtedly appreciated, that the commencement of proceedings against the appellant would have brought their relationship to an end.  That is quite a different circumstance to that which confronted the plaintiff in Saunders.  In this case, the respondent had to decide whether or not to maintain the relationship.  This may have involved a difficult emotional decision on her part, with potentially serious consequences for the relationship.  The difficulty in making a decision because of ""human psychological dynamics"" is not the same as being substantially impeded in her ability to commence the cause of action by reason of an impaired mental condition.  
117A decision as to whether or not to end a relationship or to take a step which will have the effect of ending a relationship, can be very difficult particularly when emotions are heavily involved.  An unwillingness to make such a decision, however, is not indicative of mental impairment as used in s11(3)(b) LTA.  People do remain in relationships despite volatility because of mutual attraction.
118In this case the respondent appears to have made a considered decision to continue with the relationship and not take any action which would bring it to an end.  This is consistent with her evidence at trial:
""Q.  But going back in time in 2007, you were aware of various meetings with the solicitor who was going to act and who was acting in respect of the conveyancing transactions between the trust and David and yourself and Gaythorne, I think?A.  Yes.  That had already been organised.
Q.  And did you meet the solicitor?A.  Actually the solicitor was Bob's and my solicitor at that particular time.
Q.  As well?A.  Yes.
Q.  You never spoke to that solicitor to get any advice regarding any of the matters that you complain of in your affidavit regarding the alleged assaults by Mr Cooper upon you did you?A.  I never complained about anything in particular.  I didn't speak to - I didn't speak freely to people about these things.
Q.  When you were taken to Brisbane Hospital in 2007, there were a number of those occasions where Mr Cooper would leave you in the St Helens Road property, wouldn't he?A.  Yes.
Q.  Or he would leave you with your son David is that right?A.  Yes.
Q.  And you were able to go to speak to a solicitor if you chose to do so weren't you?A.  Yes.
Q.  And you were able to speak to the solicitor about the matters that concerned you about my client's behaviour?A.  I would never discuss those things with anyone.
Q.  I didn't ask you that.  You were able to discuss those matters?A.  No, I was not able because I'm not like that.  I don't do that.  I'm not like that.  I don't complain to people about my problems.
Q.  I'm not asking whether you do or you don't complain.  You were able to see a solicitor if you chose to do so regarding the matter you complain of about these alleged assaults.A.  Goodness me.  I have answered the question as best I can.""  (Black AB 267X-268T)
""Q.  When you were staying at Mitchelton, Mr Cooper would often leave you at that property and drive back to Harwood or somewhere else in New  South Wales or Queensland in respect of the businesses that he was involved with?A.  On a few occasions, yes.
Q.  And on those few occasions you could have gone to a solicitor to discuss the actions or the alleged assaults that you now complain of couldn't you?A.  But I am, I wouldn't and don't and you know.
Q.  What I am suggesting to you - I'm sorry I interrupted.  You ""wouldn't and I don't"" - that is, you say, you tell his Honour, that you chose not to, is that so?A.  I didn't even consider it.
Q.  Didn't consider it?A.  No.
Q.  You could have gone and got advice if you had wished to?A.  Oh goodness me.""  (Black AB271T-272E)
""Q.  If I take you back towards the beginning of 2006, late 2005, Janice Young has been engaged to do bookkeeping; is that right?A.  Yes, that's right.
Q.  And at that time you were able if you chose to go to a solicitor in respect of the assaults that you have complained about in this proceeding, weren't you?A.  See, I find that question very difficult to answer because I am not given to going to people and telling them about my problems or issues or whatever.
Q.  The proposition I put to you then is that you chose not to go to anybody to tell of your complaints against you, is that right?A.  I don't consider it as a choice.  I didn't -
HIS HONOUR:  Q:  You just didn't do it?A.  No.
COUNSEL:  Q.  The position was you chose not to do it, wasn't it?A.  I'm really sorry, I just don't know how to answer that question because I never considered it as a choice or ...""  (Black 289Q-290E)
119It follows from the above that the primary judge was in error in relying upon the conclusions of Dr Fisher when those conclusions were not based on the evidence.  His Honour erred in rejecting the evidence of Dr Klug without properly evaluating it and assessing its probative value against that of Dr Fisher.  As a result, his Honour erred in finding that the respondent was under a disability within the meaning of s52 LTA.  Grounds of Appeal 3 and 4 have been made out.
120The consequences for the respondent are that the assaults and batteries found to have occurred in 1995, 1996 and December 2000 are statute barred and the respondent is not entitled to damages in relation to them.  The respondent is entitled to damages in respect of the assault which occurred in 2007.
Ground of Appeal 5:  The primary judge erred in awarding general damages of $50,000 in respect of the assault and battery in 1995.
Ground of Appeal 6:  The primary judge erred in awarding general damages of $50,000 in respect of the assault and battery in December 2000.
Ground of Appeal 7:  The primary judge erred in awarding general damages of $40,000 in respect of the assault in 2007.
Ground of Appeal 8:  The primary judge's assessment of general damages was beyond the range of damages, having regard to the circumstances of each claim.
Ground of Appeal 14:  The primary judge erred in awarding aggravated damages.
Ground of Appeal 15:  The primary judge erred in awarding aggravated damages on a basis other than to compensate the respondent for injury resulting from the manner and circumstances of the appellant's wrongdoing.
Ground of Appeal 16:  Alternatively, the primary judge erred in awarding aggravated damages of $100,000.
Ground of Appeal 17:  In awarding aggravated damages, the primary judge failed to distinguish between the consequences of the assaults, in respect of which he awarded damages and the consequence of the conduct of the appellant generally, which did not constitute an assault or battery.
121As a result of the appellant's success in relation to Grounds of Appeal 3 and 4, the only relevant ground of appeal in relation to the assaults and batteries is Ground 7.  In case I am found to have been in error in my assessment of Grounds of Appeal 3 and 4, I propose to address all of the above Grounds of Appeal.
122Although the primary judge purported to award damages for the specific effect of each assault and battery, the size of the damages are such that they could only be justified if their combined effect produced the conditions found to exist by Dr Fisher, i.e., a mixed anxiety depressive syndrome, which had reduced the respondent to a state of thralldom to the appellant.  That the primary judge had this in mind is clear from the way in which he expressed himself in relation to damages.
""275 ... I am also satisfied that by reason of the assaults and batteries the defendant has suffered anxiety and depression.""  (RAB 229L)
""293 ... This is because, although there has been an award in respect of the individual assaults it can be seen from the medical evidence that the combined effect of the assaults extended over the whole of the relationship with a pervasive affect on the defendant.""  (RAB 233 K-L) 
That is how the respondent sought to justify the amount of the damages awards in submissions in the appeal (11.4.2013 - T.18.22 - 19.42).
123The difficulty with that approach is that it is not supported by the evidence.  Dr Fisher neither in terms, nor implicitly, asserted that the particular assaults and batteries relied upon as having occurred in 1993, 1995, 1996, December 2000 and 2007 produced the anxiety and depression which he diagnosed in the respondent.  On the contrary, he expressly found that it was the effect of the whole of the relationship with its ""constant"" abuse and ""threats of violence"" which produced the condition.  At no time did Dr Fisher analyse the effect of the particular assaults and batteries, either collectively or individually in any detail.  That was part of the problem with his opinion which led to the success of Grounds of Appeal 3 and 4.  Accordingly, there is no medical support for the awarding of damages at such a high level.
124Moreover, the primary judge when analysing the individual assaults and batteries indicated that their effects would have lasted for a matter of weeks only.  Although his Honour expressed this opinion in the context of considering whether the assaults had affected the respondent's homemaker contributions, it remains his only finding on the subject.  At RAB 188I - J, his Honour said:
""Assuming that the fear generated by the incidents had some immediate affect on contributions at the time of affectation, a period of some weeks is of minor significance in the overall timeframe of this 15 year relationship.  This is particularly so given that there was a substantial break for many years between the incidents.""
His Honour appears to have forgotten that finding when he set out his conclusion at RAB 229L and 233K-L above.
125It is significant that when the primary judge came to assess damages (at RAB 229 and folowing), he did not refer to any evidence except in general terms.  By not doing so his Honour effectively misdirected himself in his reliance upon Varmedja v Varmedja [2007] NSWDC 385 at [111] where Walmsley DCJ said:
""A particular difficulty is the fact that there is a large number of separate torts alleged which collectively, on the psychiatric evidence, have caused the psychiatric injury ...""
In this case, the psychiatric evidence was not to that effect.  There was no evidence to that effect.
126His Honour was not able to identify any cases involving the same or similar facts as those before him.  He said:
""One can look at another case; say for example Jackson v Jackson (NSWSC, 26 March 1999, unreported) where I gave an award of $10,000 for an assault and battery in a domestic context.  The physical circumstances of that battery were far worse than anything in the present case.  However, that case did not include threats to kill.  Such threats had a real effect on the defendant and put her in fear of her life.""  (RAB 230Q - T)
127The facts of Jackson, as his Honour acknowledged, involved a much more serious physical assault than anything in this case.  The victim in that case was severely bashed in public and suffered long term physical injury.  
128It is difficult to see how a conditional threat in terms of ""I really should get rid of the rifles.  I'm either going to shoot you or shoot myself or both of us"" said in the course of a argument in 2000 would have put the respondent in fear of her life when the threat was never implemented, nor repeated for the next six years.  This is particularly so when the evidence from the respondent was equivocal.  I use the term 'equivocal' because of the ""disconnect"" identified by the appellant in submissions between what the respondent said in her affidavit about being in fear and her actions in going spotlight shooting and willingly living in an isolated location with him.
129Of some assistance when considering damages is the decision of the Court of Appeal in Victoria in Giller v Procopets [2008] VSCA 236.  The Court was there required to assess damages for assault and battery in a domestic context.
130The Victorian Court of Appeal approved the proposition that the victim of a domestic assault was entitled to compensation ""for any injury suffered, pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life together with any distress, indignity and humiliation"" (Neave JA at [480]).  I agree with that statement of principle.
131Keeping in mind that each case depends on its own facts and that one should not look at damages findings in one case as fixing some kind of tariff for another case, it is helpful to set out the facts of one of the assaults in Procopets and the damages which were awarded.
""The defendant struck the plaintiff with a metal framed kitchen chair on the right arm and her right shoulder.  Police were called. ...  The injuries were bruising and lacerations to the lower right arm and some restricted painful movement of right shoulder.  The plaintiff said that she suffered the effects for about a month.  ...  No medical treatment was sought. ...  While the injuries were not serious, I am satisfied that they were not minor.""  (Procopets [481])
132Neave JA considered that $1000 as damages for that assault was inadequate.  Her Honour found that it ""was a serious assault which affected Ms Giller for a month.  Mr Giller was in her home, a place where she was entitled to feel safe, when she was assaulted. ...""  Damages were assessed at $5000.
133It is useful to keep those principles and their application in Procopets in mind when considering the assaults and batteries found to have occurred by the primary judge.  The first was an assault and battery in 1995.  His Honour dealt with that at RAB 173J - 174Q.  This was the incident where the appellant grabbed the arm of the respondent and dragged her down the back stairs from the kitchen to the backyard.  At the end of that incident, the appellant said ""Get out of my fuckin' sight.  Disappear.  If you don't I'll fuckin' kill you.  I'm fuckin' out of here.  I'm going to pack my stuff and find somewhere else to live.  Don't come back 'til I'm gone.  I promise you I'll fuckin' kill you"" (See [38] hereof).  The respondent left the house for a couple of hours and then returned but kept out of the way of the appellant until he departed the premises.  She said that she was afraid of him.
134The physical element of the battery was minimal.   There was no physical injury or pain and suffering.  Threats were made but they were conditional and nothing was done to implement them.  The respondent was afraid but this state of fear appears to have lasted for only a few days.  In those circumstances, an award of damages of $50,000 was excessive.  Were it necessary to assess damages for that assault and battery, my assessment would be $5,000 based primarily upon the fear engendered in the respondent by the incident.
135The appellant made no challenge to the $2,000 in damages awarded for the assault in 1996.  Its only relevance is to the award of aggravated damages.
136The next incident challenged by the appellant is that of December 2000, involving the pouring of beer and threats made to the appellant.  This was dealt with by the primary judge at RAB 176D-181U.  There was no physical injury.  There was, however, implicit in the actions of the appellant an intention to humiliate the respondent.  The appellant's conduct is consistent with an intention to demonstrate to the respondent in what low esteem he held her.  The conduct, however, did occur in private.  I can well understand why such deliberate and contemptuous conduct would have a serious and deleterious effect on the respondent's emotional health.
137The threat was in the following terms:
""This is driving me fuckin' nuts, I really should get rid of the rifles.  I'm either going to shoot you or shoot myself or both of us.""
The respondent said that the communication of this threat made her ""terrified"".  Apart from the fact that the appellant owned two rifles (only one of which was capable of being fired), he never did anything to implement the threat.  There is no suggestion that he picked up a rifle, or pointed a rifle towards the respondent.  Although she says she was ""terrified"", the respondent did not relate this incident to any doctor, except Dr Kraushaar in 2009, nor did she include it in her affidavit. The evidence emerged for the first time at trial.  I infer that the respondent's failure to mention the threat before trial indicates that she did not regard it as particularly significant.
138When assessing damages for this incident, I regard the pouring of the beer as much more important.  The demeaning element in that conduct is such as would attract aggravated damages.  For the reasons which I will indicate in due course, this is the only incident which would attract aggravated damages.  Nevertheless, the amount awarded for compensatory damages of $50,000 in respect of this incident is excessive, even if aggravated damages were taken into account.  Should it be necessary to assess damages in respect of this incident, I would assess them at $20,000, such amount to include aggravated damages.  
139The final incident is that of 2007 which the primary judge held to be an assault.  He dealt with this incident at RAB 182S - 183R.  The circumstances in which the threat was made were almost identical to those described as having occurred at Christmas 2000.  In the course of an argument, the appellant said:
""This is frustrating the shit out of me.  I really should get rid of the rifles.  I will either shoot myself because I'm going nuts or shoot you.""
The respondent said that this was a ""terrifying thing to hear"".  The respondent made no mention of such an incident until trial.  She did not refer to it when giving histories to any of the doctors, nor did she refer to it in her affidavit.  I infer that its effect upon her was transient at most.  I am confirmed in that assessment because the relationship ended approximately three months later in September 2007.
140The assault involved a threat which was indirect.  The effect of the threat was not such as to remain in the forefront of the respondent's mind in that she failed to mention it to anyone when preparing for the trial.  Its effect on her was not long lasting.  Nothing was done to implement the threat or reinforce it after it had been made.  Neither the threat itself nor the circumstances in which it was made are such as to give rise to agravated damages.  In those circumstances, the assessment of $40,000 for compensatory damages by his Honour was excessive.  I assess damages at $4,000.
141It follows from the above that Grounds of Appeal 5, 6, 7 and 8 have been made out.
142His Honour set out the basis for his award of aggravated damages at RAB 233I - L, (see [60] hereof).  Because Grounds of Appeal 3 and 4 have been upheld, the challenge to his Honour's assessment of aggravated damages at $100,000 must succeed and that finding should be set aside.  As indicated, in relation to the assault found to have occurred in mid 2007, its circumstances were not such as to attract an award of aggravated damages.
143If I am incorrect in upholding Grounds of Appeal 3 and 4, I would still uphold Grounds of Appeal 14 -17 and set aside the primary judge's award of aggravated damages.
144It is trite law that aggravated damages are compensatory in nature and focus on the damage suffered by the recipient, whereas exemplary damages are punitive in nature and focus on the conduct of the person causing the harm.  Aggravated damages are awarded to compensate a plaintiff for increased mental suffering due to the manner in which the defendant has behaved in committing the wrong.  ""Aggravated damages, it has been said, are intended to compensate the injured plaintiff because the more reprehensible the wrongdoer's conduct, the greater the indignity the plaintiff suffers and the greater the outrage to his or her feelings"".  (Whitbread and Anor v Rail Corporation NSW and Ors [2011] NSWCA 130 (Whealy JA) at [256].
145For the reasons already given, it was not open to his Honour when considering whether or not to award aggravated damages to examine the whole of the conduct of the appellant within the relationship over 14 years.  What his Honour was required to do was to consider the specific assaults and batteries and assess the entitlement to aggravated damages, resulting from those incidents, either individually or collectively.  Apart from the incident involving the beer, there was nothing in the other incidents which could possibly give rise to an award of aggravated damages.  The global award of $100,000 is not supported by any reasoning or reference to the evidence.  
146Grounds of Appeal 14 - 17 should be upheld and the award of $100,000 for aggravated damages should be set aside.  
Ground of Appeal 9:  The primary judge erred in awarding damages for past and future economic loss.
Ground of Appeal 10:  The primary judge failed to give adequate reasons for awarding damages for past and future economic loss.
Ground of Appeal 11:  The awards of damages for past and future economic loss were not supported by the evidence.
Ground of Appeal 12:  The primary judge erred in awarding damages for past and future out-of-pocket expenses.
Ground of Appeal 13:  In awarding general damages for past and future economic loss and damages for past and future out-of-pocket expenses the primary judge failed to distinguish between the consequences of the assaults in respect of which he awarded damages and the consequence of the conduct of the appellant generally which did not constitute an assault or battery.
147His Honour's reasons for awarding economic loss and out-of-pocket expenses are set out at RAB 231J-R (see [62] hereof).  His Honour gave no reasons for awarding economic loss, nor did he refer to any evidence.
148The only evidence on the subject is in the report of Dr Fisher of 30 June 2011 at Blue AB 767P - 768M.  That evidence was:
""8) You ask -Is it reasonable, having regard to her then condition, that Mrs Mulcahy was incapacitated as set forth under Paragraph 6(a)(1) of the Amended Statement of Cross-Claim Past Economic Loss?
I believe that it is reasonable, having regard to her then condition, that Mrs Mulcahy was incapacitated, as set forth.
9) You ask - Similarly, would Mrs Mulcahy likely have been unable to carry out the work described in paragraph 6(a)(iii) of the Amended Statement of Cross Claim?
I believe that this is, on the balance of probability, likely to be true.
10) You ask - Would I further provide my opinion, again, on the balance of probabilities only, as to whether it is likely that Mrs Mulcahy's current incapacity for work will continue into the future and, if so, is this probably the case on an indefinite basis?
I do not believe that it is likely that Mrs Mulcahy's current incapacity for work will continue into the future, if she engaged in appropriate psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic management of her Mixed Anxiety Depressive condition, and particularly if there is a favourable outcome to her Cross Claim.
In the event that she fails to be successful in her Cross Claim, I believe it will be tantamount to driving the final nail into the coffin of her self-confidence and her sense of fairness, in the face of the abuse to which she has allegedly been subjected to by Mr Cooper.
11) You ask -What are the prospects, if any, of her returning, during the remainder of her prospective working life, to any gainful employment and, if so, in what measure?
As I have indicated above, I believe that with the correct intervention and with what is perceived as a fair outcome of the legal proceedings, she could return to gainful employment, subject to her successful response to treatment.  The latter of course is yet to occur and is beyond definite prognostication at this stage.""
149The references by Dr Fisher to various paragraphs in the Amended Statement of Cross-Claim are to paragraphs in the ""Statement of Particulars Personal Injury Proceedings"" at RAB 69P-70N.  The relevant paragraphs are:
""6     (a) Past Economic Loss
(i)       After separation, the cross claimant was no longer able to participate in the businesses which she formerly operated with the plaintiff and would have sought employment had she not been totally incapacitated for work by reason of her injuries and disabilities. She claims damages for economic loss on the basis of total incapacity as set out below,
(ii)       If the cross claimant was not totally incapacitated for work she would have sought full time employment as a shop assistant from the date of separation and earned in the order of $555.30 per week net.  She claims $555.30 per week from 1 October 2007 to date and continuing. (Retail Industry Interim Award 2004).
(iii)      In the alternative to paragraph 6(a)(ii) the cross claimant would have undertaken study for 7 days, at a cost of $1,040.00, to obtain a real estate agent's licence to work in affordable housing. From the commencement of 2008, the cross claimant would have commenced employment and earned $530.09 per week net. She claims $530.09 per week from 1 February 2008 to date and continuing (Property Management Award Qld 2005).""
150The only other evidence was that of the respondent.  She had not worked in any paid employment since 1983 (Black AB 230V-231D).  In cross-examination her evidence was:
""Q.  You didn't seek to get any work after early 2009 from any source?A.  No.
Q.  You didn't seek to get a job as a sales person?A.  No.
Q.  You didn't seek - well that was work you could have done in 2009 wasn't it?A.  I think I was up to my ears providing affidavits.
Q.  With the litigation were you?A.  And, yes, and all pretty distressing.
Q.  If you were not involved with the litigation, you could have worked as a sales assistant of some sort couldn't you?A.  I guess so, but if you say so, yes.
Q.  In respect of Grafton, as I understand, you have from time to time worked as in the cleaning operations when tenants vacated those premises?A.  Yes.
Q.  It was open to you to run a business which, or a real estate agent which did the cleaning when tenants vacated is that right?A.  It was open to me?
Q.  Yes.A.  When was it open to me?
Q.  2009.A.  Oh you are sort of hypothetically?  Nobody approached me for it.
Q.  You didn't choose to go and work doing that sort of cleaning work which you had previously done?A.  I really was - I really was in - I was - doing my affidavits and up to my ears and I had no idea that it was going to go on - this whole situation was going to go on for such a long time.""  (Black AB 229M - 230F)
151The principles underlying a claim for economic loss and loss of earning capacity have been stated in a number of cases.  Those principles are conveniently set out in Husher v Husher [1999] HCA 47; 197 CLR 138 at [7] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ):
""7 Since at least Graham v Baker it has been recognised that it is convenient to assess an injured plaintiff's economic loss ""by reference to the actual loss of wages which occurs up to the time of trial and which can be more or less precisely ascertained and then, having regard to the plaintiff's proved condition at the time of trial, to attempt some assessment of his future loss"".  But damages for both past loss and future loss are allowed to an injured plaintiff ""because the diminution of his earning capacity is or may be productive of financial loss"".  Both elements are important. It is necessary to identify both what capacity has been lost and what economic consequences will probably flow from that loss.  Only then will it be possible to assess what sum will put the plaintiff in the same position as he or she would have been in if injury had not been sustained.""
152I have concluded that the respondent has failed to satisfy both those requirements.  The evidence of Dr Fisher set out above is not sufficient to establish incapacity to work on the part of the respondent caused by the assaults and batteries found by the primary judge to have occurred.  He has provided no reasons for that assertion.  Such reasons are necessary because basal to Dr Fisher's opinion was that the whole relationship had brought about the respondent's incapacity.  He did not turn his mind to the specific assaults and batteries.  The difficulty is compounded for the respondent because only the assault of mid 2007 can be relied upon.
153Even if incapacity due to the assaults and batteries could be established, there is no evidence that the respondent wished to undertake employment or was seeking to do so but was prevented as a result of the assaults.  To the extent that there is any evidence, it is to the contrary.  Accordingly, the second limb identified in Husher has not been satisfied.
154Those difficulties exist not only in the claim for past economic loss but also in that for future loss of earning capacity.  Accordingly, Grounds 9 - 11 should be upheld and the primary judge's award of damages for past economic loss and future loss of earning capacity should be set aside.
155The same problem arises in relation to the award of damages for past and future out-of-pocket expenses.  The past out-of-pocket expenses of $19,218.35 related primarily to treatment provided by Dr Krauschaar.  It is common ground that the appellant agreed to the mathematics associated with the claim for past and future out-of-pocket expenses, but did not agree that there was any entitlement to them.  The claim for future out-of-pocket expenses also related to treatment to be administered by Dr Krauschaar, or some similarly qualified person.
156As with the economic loss claims, there is no evidence which distinguishes between the effect of the assaults and batteries found to be compensible by the primary judge and the effect of other conduct by the appellant which did not amount to assault and which occurred during the whole of the 14 year relationship.  Dr Fisher made no such distinction, nor did the primary judge.  Accordingly, there is no evidentiary foundation for the awarding of damages for out-of-pocket expenses by his Honour.  The position is even clearer if Grounds of Appeal 3 and 4 are upheld and the only compensible event is the assault of 2007.
157Grounds of Appeal 12 and 13 should be upheld and the award of damages by the primary judge for out-of-pocket expenses should be set aside.
Amended Notice of Cross-AppealCross-Appeal Ground 1:  The Cross-Appellant appeals from the decision below in respect of the claim under the Property (Relationships) Act 1984 for the following reasons:
(a) His Honour erred in refusing to make an order that the Cross-Respondent pay to the Cross-Appellant forthwith the value of her share of the property, having regard to:
(i) The fact that the Cross-Appellant was unable to earn income by reason of her medical condition.
(ii) That the Cross-Appellant was living on a disability support pension supplemented only by a small amount of rental income; and
(iii) The Cross-Respondent had liquid assets of $15 million which were available to pay out the Cross-Appellant.
(b) His Honour erred in failing to make proper findings on the basis of the evidence of Dr Fisher (whom he accepted) as to the nature and seriousness of the Cross-Appellant's medical condition and as to their bearing on the question of whether:
(i) The Cross-Respondent should have been ordered to pay the Cross-Appellant forthwith the value of her share of the property awarded.
(ii) The Cross-Appellant should be required to work with the Cross-Respondent in the realisation of their assets.
(c) If necessary the Cross-Appellant will seek leave of the Court to present evidence as to her medical condition between judgment and the hearing of the appeal.
158No evidence was adduced as to the respondent's medical condition between judgment and the hearing of the appeal.
159The order sought in Ground 1 of the Cross-Appeal was rejected by the primary judge at RAB 201B - E (see [55] hereof).  Of the two reasons given by the primary judge, the first is no longer applicable as a result of this appeal.  The second reason remains valid, i.e., that it was important that ""both parties have an incentive to attend properly to the realisation of their assets"".
160The effect of the orders sought by the respondent is to require the appellant to ""buy out"" her interest in the property of the parties, as opposed to ordering a sale of the properties and a division of the proceeds.  The grounds supporting this order are the relative financial positions of the parties and the health of the respondent. Given the findings in the appeal as to the conflict of opinion between Dr Fisher and Dr Klug, the argument based on the respondent's health is problematic.  The outcome of the appeal, however, will not assist the respondent's financial position.
161In the appeal, the appellant submitted that for most of the 16 days of the trial the respondent's position was that there should be a sale of the real estate and a reckoning carried out thereafter between the parties.  He submitted that the first time a ""buy out"" order was proposed was in the written submissions served in January 2012, after the close of the oral evidence.  Before the respondent adopted that position, the parties had agreed on certain values for the real estate to assist the judge in his consideration of the matter (Black AB 843.15).  The respondent did not disagree with that submission.
162The appellant submitted that the matter was litigated on the basis of a sale and distribution of the proceeds and that the agreement as to valuations might well not have been given if there was to be a lump sum ""buy out"".  The appellant submitted that if the order were to be made, there would be no incentive for the respondent to co-operate in the sale of the property and that he would carry all of the risk associated with the sale of the property, particularly if the value realised on the sale was less than that agreed to in the proceedings.
163Despite the financial hardship of the respondent, I am not satisfied that his Honour erred in his approach to the order which was sought at trial.  The application at trial was made late.  Given the state of the relationship between the appellant and the respondent, there is a very real chance of a lack of co-operation in the sale of the properties unless both sides have an incentive to do so.  There is also force in the appellant's submission that it would be unfair for him to carry the risk of the price achieved for the properties not matching the valuations agreed at trial.  I would dismiss Ground 1 of the Cross-Appeal.
Ground of Cross-Appeal 2:  The Cross-Appellant contends that the decision below on the tort claim should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied on by the trial judge namely:
(a) That the order for adjustment of property of 60 percent to the Cross-Appellant was less than should have been awarded having regard to the principle In the Marriage of Kennon (1997) 22 Fam LR 1 and in light of his Honour's finding that ""the combined effect of the assaults extended over the whole of the relationship with a pervasive affect on the defendant"".
(b) If the amount awarded for damages on the Cross-Claim for assault was too high, which is denied, that the result is in any event correct once account is taken of the matters referred to in paragraph 2(a).
164Having fully reviewed the circumstances surrounding each assault and battery, the primary judge set out his conclusion in relation to the Kennon principle at RAB 108 F-N (see [54] hereof).  No error has been identified by the respondent in his Honour's conclusions or approach to this issue.  There was an absence of evidence as to the effect of the assaults and batteries found to have occurred on the respondent's homemaker contributions.  The result of this appeal, with its further analysis of the effect of the assaults and batteries, has confirmed rather than eroded the conclusion of the primary judge.  This ground of the Cross-Appeal should be dismissed.
165The first day of the appeal was 4 December 2012.  The matter did not conclude that day and resumed on 11 April 2013.  On that second day, the respondent sought leave to rely upon a Further Amended Notice of Cross-Appeal which added the following grounds:
""3 The primary judge erred in failing to award damages for the proved assault in May 1993 on the basis that it was excluded from consideration by operation of s 11 of the Limitation Act 1969, which was inconsistent with his findings in paragraphs 270 and 271 of the judgment (Red 228).
4. In considering the award of aggravated damages, the primary judge failed to take into account the conduct of the proceedings by the Cross-Respondent, such conduct being:
(a) The Cross-Respondent maintained denials of behaviour which the primary judge found to constitute assaults, those denials including:
(i) Maintaining under oath a position which the primary judge found was ""plainly wrong"";
(ii) Persisting in blanket denials which were ""not appropriate""; and
(iii) Thus making it necessary for the Cross-Appellant to give evidence and subject herself to cross-examination on the distressing circumstances of the assaults.
(b) The Cross-Respondent admitted during cross-examination that he included a claim that he was entitled to 100 percent of the property of the relationship with full knowledge that that claim was not justified and must have an emotional effect on the Cross-Appeallant (Black 736.30 - .38).
(c) The Cross-Respondent sought to conceal from the Cross-Appellant the fact of his entitlement to share in a significant lottery win by making deceptive statements during attempts to resolve the case including:
(i) Instructing his solicitors to file a Notice of Ceasing to Act twenty days after the lottery win.
(ii) Representing that he was not able to afford a solicitor and was facing bankruptcy.
(iii) Representing to the Cross-Respondent's solicitors that he had no funds to meet mortgage obligations on the properties owned with the Cross-Appellant within days of his sons entering into contracts to purchase properties with his assistance.""
166It was common ground that notice of the proposed amendments to the Notice of Cross-Appeal were communicated to senior counsel for the appellant late on Friday, 5 April 2013, i.e. five days before the resumption of the appeal.  The application for leave to rely upon the Further Amended Notice of Appeal was opposed by the appellant.  During the course of argument, the respondent withdrew her application to rely upon paragraph 4(b) because it had been the subject of an informal undertaking given at trial.
167The Court refused leave to the respondent to rely upon the Further Amended Notice of Cross-Appeal and ordered her to pay the appellant's costs associated with the application to amend.  The Court advised that it would provide reasons for the refusal of leave when judgment in the appeal was handed down.  The following are those reasons.
168The application to amend was made very late and no evidence or explanation was provided to explain the delay.  As such, the application failed to comply with both the spirit and the effect of s56 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005.  The application also was contrary to the statements of principle in Aon Risk Services of Australia Ltd v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27; 239 CLR 175 at [97] - [98].  Those considerations of themselves were sufficient to dispose of the late application to amend.  
169There were, however, other considerations.
170With respect to proposed ground 3, had the amendment been allowed it would have been open to the appellant to contest not only the damages question but the issue of whether the incident was capable of being an assault.  This is because the facts involved the appellant leaving a note when he went to Melbourne saying ""Don't be here when I get back"".  Accordingly, a real issue as to whether the respondent was placed ""in imminent fear of physical violence"" by the note would have been raised.  In order to deal with this ground the appeal would have been needlessly lengthened to deal with what at best was a peripheral issue.
171In relation to proposed Grounds 4(a) and (c), it is difficult to argue that the primary judge failed to take a matter into account when he was not asked to do so.  These grounds raise a claim based on abuse of process, which was never made at trial.  No findings were made by his Honour except inferentially when he was dealing with costs.  Accordingly, this Court would have been required to make primary findings itself without having the benefit of an analysis and findings by the trial judge.
172There is another and more fundamental objection to Grounds 4(a) and (b).  A claim seeking aggravated damages because of abuse of process would undoubtedly have required additional evidence to be called by the appellant in order to respond to the claim.  To allow such an amendment would offend the principle in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33; 162 CLR 1.
173The respondent sought leave to appeal against the primary judge's order as to costs.  The Ground of Appeal was in the following terms:
""The trial judge:
(a) Erred in the exercise of his discretion in failing to take into account the material considerations that:
(i) Cooper had sought 100 percent of the assets of the parties until shortly before the hearing.
(ii) Cooper denied the tort claim in his defence to the Amended Cross-Claim.
(iii) Shortly before the hearing Cooper's position was that he should receive 40 percent of the assets, plus $176,000 with a verdict in his favour on the tort claim.
(iv) The position taken by  Cooper from a time shortly before the hearing until its conclusion required Mulcahy to accept a verdict in his favour on the tort claim if the application for adjustment of property was to be resolved; and
(v) It was important to Mulcahy, both financially and psychologically that she pursue redress for Cooper's assaults on her.
(b) Erred in failing to order that Cooper pay Mulcahy's costs of the application for adjustment of property in circumstances whereby reason of Cooper's refusal to settle the application for adjustment of property unless Mulcahy abandoned her tort claim, she was left no option but to run both claims to judgment.""
174In a separate judgment given on 29 May 2012, the primary judge ordered that the respondent pay the appellant's costs of the claim for property adjustment on the ordinary basis and that the appellant pay the respondent's costs of the cross-claim on the ordinary basis.  The parties had argued for a different result.  The appellant submitted that each party should bear his or her own costs of the whole proceedings, whereas the respondent sought an order that the appellant pay the costs of the proceedings on the ordinary basis until 29 June 2011 and thereafter on an indemnity basis.
175The costs order made by the primary judge will have to be set aside as a result of the outcome of the appeal.  It is appropriate that the parties be given the opportunity to make submissions as to the costs of the trial, in the light of the result of the appeal.  In view of the substantial costs which have already been incurred, the parties should give consideration to agreeing to an appropriate costs order.  
Conclusion
176I propose the following orders and declarations:
(1) Appeal allowed.
(2) A declaration that the pool of assets for distribution between the parties is $1,405,782.
(3) A declaration that each of the respondent's claims for damages for assault and/or battery as found by the primary judge is statute barred, save for the 2007 assault.
(4) Quash the judgment in favour of the respondent on her cross-claim.
(5) Enter judgment for the respondent on her cross-claim against the appellant in the amount of $4,000.
(6) The respondent is to pay the appellant's costs of the appeal and of the cross-appeal and to have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act 1951 if qualified.
(7) The parties are to advise the Court within seven days of the date of judgment as to whether they have been able to agree as to the costs of the trial.
(8) Direct that if the parties are unable to agree as to the costs of the trial:
 (a) Within seven days of the date of this judgment, the appellant lodge with the Court a submission identifying the costs order which he contends should be made, such submissions not to exceed two folios.
(b) Within seven days thereafter the respondent is to lodge a reply, not to exceed two folios.
(c) Within a further seven days, the appellant lodge any submission in reply to that of the respondent, not to exceed one folio.

2706596,R v Hawkins [2013] NSWCCA 208,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I will now ask Justice RS Hulme to deliver judgment in this matter.
2R S HULME AJ: This is an appeal by the Crown against sentences imposed on 9 November 2012 by Woods DCJ on the above named Respondent in respect of 8 offences for which a total effective sentence of imprisonment for 3 years 4 months including a non-parole period of 1 year 8 months was fixed.
3The first offence was that between about 16 and 23 May 2001 the Respondent defrauded the Commonwealth in that in the 2000 tax return of Pacific Computing and Innovation Pty Ltd total expenses of $440,694 were claimed, which amount was falsely inflated.  This was an offence against s29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which carried a maximum period of imprisonment of 10 years.  The overstatement of expenses was to the extent of at least $191,020 and the resultant saving in tax was something over $68,000.
4The remaining offences arose under s134.2(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) and each also carried a maximum period of imprisonment of 10 years.  Each charge was to the effect that the Respondent did by deception dishonestly obtain a financial advantage from the Commonwealth.  The deception was said to have occurred in tax returns, some of the Respondent and some of Pacific Computing and Innovation Pty Ltd.  (It will be convenient hereafter to refer to that company as ""PCI"")
5Count 2 alleged that in the 2001 tax return of PCI total expenses of $309,891 were claimed, which amount was falsely inflated.  The overstatement of expenses was to the extent of at least $184,162 and the resultant saving in tax was something over $62,000.
6Count 3 alleged that in his 2001 personal tax return the Respondent failed to include all his income.  The understatement was to the extent of $407,498.76.
7Count 4 alleged that in the 2002 tax return of PCI total expenses of $288,532 were claimed, which amount was falsely inflated.  The overstatement of expenses was to the extent of at least $164,348 and the resultant saving in tax was something over $49,000.
8Count 5 alleged that in his 2002 personal tax return the Respondent failed to include all his income.  The understatement was to the extent of $21,133.
9Count 6 alleged that in his 2003 personal tax return the Respondent failed to include all his income.  The understatement was to the extent of $324,399.
10Count 7 alleged that in the 2004 tax return of PCI total expenses of $394,117 were claimed, which amount was falsely inflated.  The overstatement of expenses was to the extent of at least $186,028 and the resultant saving in tax was something over $55,800.
11Count 8 alleged that in his 2003 personal tax return the Respondent failed to include all his income.  The understatement was to the extent of $182,581. 
12The saving in tax arising from the offences involving PCI totalled $236,495.08.  The saving in tax arising in connection with the Respondent's own tax returns was, in total, approximately $370,000.  The combined shortfall was thus approximately $600,000.  None of this money, or any penalties imposed by the Taxation authorities has been paid.
13Woods DCJ described the circumstances of the Respondent's offending as follows:
""Mr Hawkins was a client of an accounting firm known as Owen T Daniel and Company. He had originally become associated with Daniel by having gone to that firm in the normal course of his business as an IT consultant. He is a person with expertise in the management of computer systems and he went along there to do some work.
His efforts met with approval and after he had been there for some time, Mr Daniel, a person of apparently some considerable charm and charisma, invited the offender to participate in taxation arrangements which Mr Daniel assured him would be of advantage to him. He agreed. He dealt there, in that context, with Carol Abidadra, one of the employees of the firm, and he came to participate in an offshore round-robin scheme that operated to enable him to evade payment of company income tax and personal income tax.
Between the financial years ended 30 June 1999 and 2004 the offender and his Australian company, PCI, engaged in twelve international transactions and consulting expenses and interest expenses for the company PCI for the financial years ended 30 June 2000, 30 June 2001, 2002 and 2004, and failure to declare personal income for the financial years ended 30 June 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.
...
The way the scheme worked had been the brainchild apparently of a man called Robert Agius (who had offices, amongst other places, in Vanuatu, and connections in New Zealand) and Owen T Daniel, the Australian accountant who had substantial suburban offices in Burwood, Sydney. There were other people involved, but they were the two principals, it appears to me.
The offender, Mr Hawkins, was advised by his advisers at Owen T Daniel to make telegraphic transfers overseas. He did so in twelve particular transactions, transferring, over the years in question, a total of $1.136 million from PCI's - that is, Pacific Computing Innovation - bank account in Australia to New Zealand bank accounts held in the name of Bilberry Limited and Security Life Nominees. These were foreign companies set up and operated in Vanuatu.
The monies were sent to New Zealand to give the appearance of the payment of legitimate business expenses, being described as ""management and consulting fees"" and ""interest expenses"". The Burwood office, particularly Carol Abidabra, recorded false business expenses in PCI's financial documents relating to these overseas payments, and these false expenses in turn flowed through to the relevant company income tax returns thereby reducing the company's taxable income declared to the Australian Taxation Office.  ...

My conclusion is that while (the Respondent) may have started off being an ""innocent abroad"" in the field of taxation, he went along initially suspending the disbelief that must have afflicted any sensible person about the arrangements that were put to him. And as the years went by, the suspension of disbelief became more and more culpable. Certainly the jury took the view that he knew what was going on.
...
... the offending by Mr Hawkins was not, as it were, started by him - but he voluntarily persisted in it over a significant period of time, as the dates in the indictment indicate. The loss to the Commonwealth is, as I say, substantial, and it needs to be taken into account.
When the police came to the offices originally, Mr Hawkins immediately gave them all the computer passwords and codes that were required for the police to, as it were, ""gut"" the system. As a result, they obtained masses of information which has led to the prosecution of a substantial number of people. The offences are objectively serious.
The factor of personal deterrence is in my view not an issue in this case. I have no doubt that Mr Hawkins has been traumatised by being brought into this situation and I have every confidence that he will never be in trouble again. He does not need to be rehabilitated. He has already learned a lesson.  However, the purpose of the offences was his own self-interest.
...
While it is true that for all offences before me, the jury verdict means that the offender knew that the scheme was not legitimate, his state of mind was, in my view, initially less blameworthy. However, as the years passed, what commenced as suspension of disbelief, albeit culpable and the turning of a blind eye, turned into what must have been a positive realisation on his part that he was simply flouting the taxation laws. The level of culpability increased as time went by.""

14Woods DCJ also found that the Respondent was of prior good character and had the benefit of a number of strong character reports, had been a hard worker and a productive member of the community.  His Honour accepted that the conduct of the trial was considerably assisted by the forensic approach taken on the Respondent's behalf of agreeing on a number of matters and said that he would make allowance for that.
15His Honour said that he took into account that sentencing the Respondent would have an impact on his family ""but I expect and hope that impact will not be too severe"" and that there would be hardship to the Respondent's employees although it might be that the Respondent's business would be able to carry on.
16His Honour observed that personal deterrence and rehabilitation were not issues and that the principal consideration in sentencing was general deterrence.  He said also that he had taken into account sentences imposed on others who had been sentenced in relation to connected or similar offences, including Mr Agius, and said that he was satisfied that the sentence imposed on the Respondent was not inconsistent with the general pattern of those sentences. 
17The sentences imposed were:
Counts 1-3 Imprisonment for 1 year commencing on 9 November 2012 and expiring on 8 November 2013;
Counts 4-5 Imprisonment for 1 year 8 months commencing on 9 November 2012 and expiring on 8 July 2014;
Counts 6-8 Imprisonment for 1 year 8 months commencing on 9 July 2014 and expiring on 8 March 2016.
18As has been said, the total effective sentence was of 3 years 4 months including a non-parole period of 1 year 8 months.
19There was no challenge to the findings of his Honour that I have set out above and although the Crown submitted that the objective criminality of the offences was extremely high and the Court might find that the sentences were manifestly inadequate, the substance of the Crown attack was that the overall sentence and the non-parole period imposed were manifestly inadequate.  In that connection the Crown relied heavily on the sentences imposed in R v Jones; R v Hili [2010] NSWCCA 108 and, on appeal, Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520. 
20The Crown submitted that the period of the Respondent's offending, 4½ years, was lengthy, the total amount of the frauds exceeded $600,000 and this was the second highest total tax shortfall referable to clients of Owen T Daniel and Company.
21In response, senior counsel for the Respondent submitted that the (shortness of the) sentence imposed was more than justified by the sentences imposed on 2 other offenders involved in the same scheme, Agius and Zerafa, and indeed was disproportionately high when compared with those earlier sentences - see R v Agius; R v Zerafa [2012] NSWSC 978.  It was contended that to allow this appeal would give rise to a legitimate sense of grievance on the part of the Respondent and in that situation, for the appeal to succeed, the Court would need to be satisfied that ""... the inadequacy of the sentence appealed from is so marked that it amounts to ""an affront to the administration of justice"" which risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system"".  Reliance was placed on the remarks of French CJ, and Crennan and Kiefel JJ in Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [42] wherein the passage quoted appears. 
22(It should be noted that a Crown appeal has been lodged in the case of Zerafa and thus the foundation for the Respondent's reliance on the sentence imposed on Zerafa may disappear.  However, the Crown has chosen not to appeal against the sentence imposed on Agius so the substance of the Respondent's submission remains.)
23As almost invariably happens in this Court, neither party sought to argue as to what the Respondent's sentence or sentences should be by reference to first principles of sentencing or comparing his criminality and subjective circumstances with the relevant statutory provisions.  Indeed there was no criticism of the individual sentences and in that situation the Court should approach the matter upon the basis that the individual sentences, at least in their length, were appropriate.
24However, that assumption creates its own quandary.  If the individual sentences were appropriate, the concurrency of sentences ordered by his Honour means that the Respondent in effect received no punishment for offences 1 - 3, and 5, the sentences for which were entirely concurrent with the sentence imposed on count 4, and no punishment for counts 7 and 8, the sentences for which were entirely concurrent with the sentence imposed for count 6.  Such a result would be justifiable if one concluded that the maximum penalty for the totality of the Respondent's offending should be no more than the total effective sentence of 3 years 4 months including a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months but such a result - for 8 offences - is surprisingly close to what was thought appropriate for but one of the individual sentences.  That circumstance alone is strongly indicative of error.
25Hili and Jones had committed offences of the same nature, carrying the same penalty, and in a similar manner as those committed by the Respondent.  Hili had lodged false income tax returns for 2 companies and for himself for the year ended 30 June 2002, for one of the companies and for himself for the year ended 30 June 2003, and for the same company for the year ended 30 June 2004.  He and his companies evaded taxation totalling just over $398,000.  Jones lodged false tax returns for his company for the year ended 30 June 2000, for himself and his company for the years ended 30 June 2001, 30 June 2002, and 30 June 2003, and for the company for the year ended 30 June 2004.  He and his company evaded taxation totalling something over $362,000.  (I should add that this summary of Hili's and Jones' offending is taken from the report at (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [5] and [6].  It differs to some degree from the account given by Rothman J at [2010] NSWCCA 108 at [6].) 
26In successful Crown appeals this Court imposed sentences of 3 years including a minimum term of 18 months imprisonment on each of Hili and Jones.  The sentences reflected allowances of 50% for pleas of guilty and assistance to the authorities.  The unusually low proportion of the non-parole periods to the total sentence was because the judge at first instance had adopted that proportion.  Appeals to the High Court by each offender were dismissed.  In the reasons of the majority of that Court for dismissing the appeals, the following appears, at [62] - [63]:
""The chief considerations which pointed to inadequacy in these cases were the nature of the offending, and the sentences that had been imposed in cases most closely comparable with the present.
The applicants' offending was sustained over a long time. It was planned, deliberate and deceitful, requiring for its implementation the telling of many lies. The applicants acted out of personal greed. The amount of tax evaded was not small. Detection of offending of this kind is not easy. Serious tax fraud, which this was, is offending that affects the whole community. As was pointed out in Ruha (2010) 198 A Crim R 430 at [45], the sentences imposed had to have both a deterrent and a punitive effect, and those effects had to be reflected in the head sentences and the reconnaissance release orders that were made.""
27Their Honours then went on to refer to two cases they considered closely comparable with the offending of Hili and Jones.  In one of these, Ly v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 28 the offender was a tax agent who lodged false income tax returns on behalf of clients who had left Australia.  In consequence refunds totalling something over $328,000 were paid to the offender.  None of these moneys had been recovered although it seemed likely that some $100,000 would be.  The number of charges preferred was 55.  The amounts the subject of the charges varied, one being as low as $381.50.  The offender was 40 at the time of sentence and had no criminal record.  He was allowed a discount of 25% for his plea and the effective sentence imposed was of 6 years including a non-parole period of 4 years.
28In allowing the Crown appeals in R v Jones; R v Hili in this Court, Rothman J, with whose judgment the other members of the Court agreed had remarked, at [14]: 
""While the analogy is not always appropriate, there is much to be said for the applicability of statements relating to customs duty to offences of this kind. In that regard, I repeat the oft quoted passage from Kitto J in L. Vogel and Son Pty. Ltd. v Anderson, Minister of State for Customs and Excise for the Commonwealth of Australia [1968] HCA 90; (1967) 120 CLR 157 at 164: 
""The duty evaded has now been paid, and I understand that when the evasions were discovered the defendants gave the Customs every assistance in their investigations. But when all the considerations relied upon by the defendants have been given due attention the case still cannot be regarded as other than a serious one. Not only are the defendants guilty of a sustained course of conscious wrongdoing, but the offences are in a field in which punishments for deliberate offences must be severe. The Customs laws represent the judgment of Parliament upon an important aspect of the economic organization of the community, and the object of the penal provisions is to make that judgment as effective as possible. It is important to remember that Customs officers have of practical necessity to rely extensively upon the information supplied to them by importers, for the flow of commerce could not be maintained if every importation had to be fully investigated. Moreover, detection of frauds is not always easy. No doubt ordinary conceptions of honesty and of civic responsibility suffice to ensure a great deal of fair dealing with the Customs, but for some people little seems to matter but fear of the consequences of discovery. The Customs Act makes those consequences potentially drastic. It is for the courts to make them, in suitable cases, drastic in fact, for otherwise traders who are not saved by qualms of conscience from willingness to defraud their fellow citizens may weight the profits they hope for against the penalties they have cause to fear and find the gamble worthwhile.""""
29I would, with respect, echo these sentiments.  See also the citation of authority in R v Boughen; R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17. 
30Even without the guidance of the decision in Hili and Jones, I would take the view that the sentence imposed on the Respondent was manifestly inadequate.   The Respondent's offending answered most of the description contained in [63] from the judgment in Hili and Jones quoted above.  Furthermore, both the head sentence of 3 years 4 months and the non-parole period of 1 year 8 months strike me as utterly disproportionate to a fraud yielding a benefit of over $600,000.  
31Save and except for the maximum penalty provided by the statutory provisions against which the Respondent offended there are no objective standards against which his offending is to be measured.  And even the statutory provision provides limited guidance in that there is no upper limit on the extent of the offending that comes within it.  However, in judging the seriousness of what the Respondent did, it seems to me that it is not inapposite to reflect on the fact that a vast number of taxpayers would need to work for at least 10 years - of course paying their living expenses meanwhile - to earn the $600,000 in after-tax or tax free money that the Respondent's offending yielded.
32The decision in Hili and Jones provides much support for this initial view.  The Respondent's offending involved substantially more money than had either Hili's or Jones' and he was not entitled to any discount for a plea or assistance.  But for that discount, the sentences imposed on Hili and Jones would have been imprisonment for 6 years including non-parole periods of 3 years.
33I return to the decision in R v Agius; R v Zerafa [2012] NSWSC 978.  The first point to be made is that Agius and Zerafa were not, within the principles of parity, co-offenders.  Although they and the Respondent were involved in the same broad scheme to which reference has been made, the activities of Agius and Zerafa involved much wider criminality than did that of the Respondent and Agius' involvement in the Respondent's offending seems to have been almost minimal.  Whether Zerafa was involved in the Respondent's offending is not apparent.
34That said, the nature of the offending of Agius, Zerafa and the Respondent had a sufficient degree of common factors that concepts of proportionality have some relevance. 
35Agius and Zerafa were sentenced by Simpson J.  Agius was charged with 2 counts of conspiracy, in effect as her Honour said, to defraud the Commonwealth over a period from 1 January 1997 to 23 October 2006, 2 charges being necessary to reflect a restructuring of Commonwealth criminal legislation that occurred in 2001.  Although the first conspiracy had carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment her Honour concluded that she should approach the matter on the basis of the reduced maximum penalty of 10 years that applied to the second conspiracy and that in the case of Mr Agius, the overriding question was one of totality.
36Her Honour concluded that Mr Agius actively presented and promoted the scheme, which was in fact that in which the Respondent participated, and implementation of it was under the direct control and supervision of Agius who received financial benefit albeit so far as the evidence before her Honour went, that benefit was relatively modest.  Her Honour also observed, at [63]:
""In respect of the eight companies (participating in the scheme) of which evidence was given, the financial loss was said to be in excess of $5 million.  But there is also an intangible loss.  The Australian taxation system, based as it is on self-assessment, depends for its integrity on the honesty of citizens. ... when it is known that the system can be, and is, cheated, the very structures of society are damaged.""    
37Her Honour accepted a Crown submission that Agius' situation was very close to a ""worst case"", calling for a penalty close to the maximum provided by law.  The effective sentence imposed was of imprisonment for 8 years and 11 months, including a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months, both of these periods having been reduced by one month on account of pre-trial custody.
38At the time of sentence Agius was approaching 63 years old, having been arrested some 4 years earlier.  Simpson J found, in the way that the trial had been conducted, some willingness to facilitate the course of justice.  
39Zerafa was engaged in the scheme for some 7 years from about mid 1999, having commenced employment with Mr Daniel in 1997 when Zerafa was 21 or 22.  He became aware of its fraudulent nature, and was involved in the maintenance of the companies' accounts and preparation of the fraudulent tax returns.  He also took an active role in organising some fabricated responses to a tax audit and other enquiries made by the Australian Taxation Office.  He was however found to have acted initially on the instructions of Mr Daniel and to have been led into his involvement ""by an unscrupulous, immoral and overpowering employer, Mr Daniel"".  Eventually he expressed his concerns to Mr Daniel and urged that no new clients be initiated into the scheme.  It would seem that his urging was followed.  
40In a comparison of the offending of Mr Agius and the Respondent it is apparent that the duration of the Respondent's offending was much shorter than that of Mr Agius and the loss to the revenue much less than that due to Mr Agius' conduct.  It may well be that the latter's own reward was appreciably less than the Respondent's.  Similar remarks could be made in connection with any comparison between Mr Agius and Hili and Jones.
41To the suggestion that there is some disparity between the sentences imposed on Mr Agius on the one hand - effectively 9 years including a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months - and the undiscounted equivalent of that imposed on Hili and Jones - 6 years including non-parole periods of 3 years, it is also to be borne in mind that the severity of a prison term is not simply proportional to its length.  As has been recognised on a number of occasions - see R v Sciberras [2006] NSWCCA 268 at [50] and R v Mahmud [2010] NSWCCA 219 at [69]:
"" ... actual imprisonment for, say 10 years is more than twice as severe as one of imprisonment for 5 years. Having regard to the sorts of terms under consideration for drug dealing a sentence of one of the longer periods is likely to have an impact on an offender's life in terms of wife, children, job prospects and the like from which he may well never recover and these sorts of considerations also have to be borne in mind.""
42In the result, I do not see the disparity for which the Respondent contends between the sentences imposed on Agius and Hili and Jones.  Nor do I see that some increase in the sentence imposed on the Respondent will necessarily create such a disparity.
43As I have indicated, counsel for the Respondent also placed emphasis on the decision made in the case of Zerafa. Clearly there are differences between Zerafa's situation and that of either Hili and Jones, or the Respondent here. However, given that Zerafa's case is the subject of appeal and notwithstanding it is the decision of an experienced member of this Court, it does not seem to me that this Court should approach the matter on the basis of disparity with the decision made in Zerafa. To do so would create its own difficulties. If this Court decided this case by reference to the decision in Zerafa, no doubt the court that heard the appeal in Zerafa would be asked to decide that case by reference to what this court had done here and to do so even if this Court had expressed, but not implemented, the view that the sentence imposed on Mr Hawkins was manifestly inadequate. For obvious reasons I say nothing about what should happen to the appeal in the case of Zerafa.
44It may be accepted as counsel for the Respondent, relying on Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49 at [35] et seq. contended, that mere manifest inadequacy in the sentence the subject of appeal does not require or justify this Court interfering and that if interference would create disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender the Court should only do so if the inadequacy of the sentence appealed from is so marked that it amounts to ""an affront to the administration of justice which risks undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system"".  I have concluded that there will not be disparity but even if that be wrong, in my view the sentence imposed on the Respondent for an offence of the magnitude of his does amount to such an affront and, even if not quite so offensive, is so low by comparison with his criminality and the tax he avoided, and with the need to deter others from defrauding the taxation authorities, and to ensure that proper sentencing standards are established, that this Court should interfere and allow the appeal.
45The sentencing principles that apply to Commonwealth offenders generally were referred to by Woods DCJ and I do not regard it as necessary to detail these.  It was not suggested that his Honour had erred in respects other than I have mentioned.  His Honour also referred to the Respondent's subjective circumstances. I take them into account but it is unnecessary that I repeat them beyond recording that the Respondent was born in 1971, is married with two children, has been a productive member of the community and, at least by persons unacquainted with the subject offending, regarded as a person of good character. His Honour took the view that personal deterrence and rehabilitation were not needed.
46During the hearing of the appeal an affidavit of the Respondent was read. He observed that from 2006 until sentence on 9 November 2012 his life had been completely disrupted. I have no difficulty in accepting that evidence though it must be recognised that to a significant degree the length of the disruption will have been because of the Respondent's decision to plead not guilty. That said it strikes me that there is something fundamentally wrong with the justice system where the return date of the Court Attendance Notice initiating the proceedings against the Respondent was 3 June 2008 while the Respondent's trial was not listed to commence until August 2011. In fact because the Respondent's legal advisers wished to call as a witness someone also facing trial at the same time as Mr Agius, the Respondent's trial did not commence until August 2012.
47In his affidavit the Respondent referred to having been imprisoned in five different locations prior to his current placement where he has been since December 2012 and to the fact that the prison authorities will not classify him until the appeal process is concluded.  He is participating in and assisting others in, various courses in custody. He also gave evidence of family difficulties consequent on his incarceration. However, apart from the fact that the Mannus Correctional Centre, where the respondent presently is, is a long way from his family, the difficulties of which he speaks are a not uncommon incident of a husband, son and parent being in prison, and not of a nature arguing for leniency. 
48One matter to which the Respondent referred which does operate in his favour is a delay of some two months in the hearing of this appeal due to the unavailability of a legal representative of the Crown. 
49For reasons given, the Crown appeal should be allowed.   The total head sentence should not be less than was thought appropriate (pre discount) in the case of Hili and Jones, viz. 6 years.  I am also of the view that the non-parole period should be 3 years 6 months.  As has been said, Woods DCJ found that personal deterrence and rehabilitation were not relevant in this case.  It follows that any consideration of a need to protect the community against the Respondent may also be put aside.  However, the duration and repetition of the Respondent's offending and the amount involved lead me to the view that considerations of general deterrence and retribution - the community's entitlement to feel that justice has been done - require a non-parole period of the length I have indicated.  Comparison with the decision in Hili and Jones where appreciably smaller amounts were involved and the notional non-parole period was 3 years - argues in the same direction.   I am satisfied that the sentence I propose is not such as to offend against considerations of proportionality or parity.
50Given the way the appeal was conducted, to achieve what I regard as the appropriate result, I would propose the following orders:  
(i) Allow the appeal;
(ii) Confirm the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 to 3, viz. imprisonment for 1 year commencing on 9 November 2012 and expiring on 8 November 2013;
(iii) Quash the sentences imposed in respect of counts 4 to 8;
(iv)  In respect of each of counts 4 and 5, sentence the Respondent to imprisonment for 1 year and 8 months commencing on 9 November 2013 and expiring on 8 July 2015; (v) In respect of each of counts 6 and 7, sentence the Respondent to imprisonment for 1 year and 8 months commencing on 9 July 2015 and expiring on 8 March 2017;
(vi)  In respect of count 8, sentence the Respondent to imprisonment for 1 year and 8 months commencing on 9 March 2017 and expiring on 8 November 2018.
(vii) Fix as the non-parole period in respect of the above sentences, 3 years 6 months commencing on 9 November 2012 and expiring on 8 May 2016. 
51HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with the orders proposed by Justice RS Hulme.
52R A HULME J:  I also agree with the orders proposed by R S Hulme AJ and with his Honour's reasons.  I wish to add the following observation.  
53Reference has been made to the learned sentencing judge taking into account hardship to the respondent's family and employees.  The judge said in relation to the respondent's family:
""I take into account that sentencing him will have an impact on his family, but I expect and hope that that impact will not be too severe. But I take it into account as I am bound to do.""
54In relation to employees, his Honour said:
""I take into account that there will be hardship to his employees.  It may be that the business that he started will be able to carry on.  Perhaps not, I do not know, but if you get involved in criminality, bad things happen to other people.""
55His Honour did not make any finding that such hardship amounted to ""exceptional circumstances"".  In my view, no such finding was open to be made on the material before him.  However, authority required such a finding before such matters could have any material significance in the assessment of sentence:  see, for example, the recent discussion of principles on the subject of taking into account hardship to third parties in R v McLeod [2013] NSWCCA 108 at [43]-[52] per Simpson J.  
56The Crown did not take issue with his Honour's treatment of this aspect of the respondent's subjective case and so the matter has not been taken into account by me in agreeing with the disposition of the appeal proposed by R S Hulme AJ.  Nevertheless, in my view this Court should not be seen to be implicitly accepting, let alone endorsing, as correct the sentencing judge's approach to this topic.
57HOEBEN CJ at CL:  The orders of the Court will therefore be those proposed by Justice R S Hulme.

		06 September 2013",2013-06-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2706597,R v Anh Thai PHAM [2013] NSWDC 166,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1I am sentencing Anh Thai Pham. I am sentencing him for a very serious crime which carries life imprisonment. The crime is supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. First I will refer to the crime and the Act of Parliament under which it is made. Then when a judge sentences a person the judge must say something about what happened to bring about the charge. Then the judge says, as I will say, something about the person, the offender, who committed the crime. I will refer to Mr Pham's evidence that he gave and the arguments of the prosecution and the defence and then I will announce the sentence.

2Mr Pham has pleaded guilty to supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. The prohibited drug is methylamphetamine. The offence is created by s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Parliament regards the crime as so serious that it has fixed a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Not only that, it has fixed a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment. 

3When I am sentencing Mr Pham he has asked me to take into account another crime that he committed. That crime was an offence of supplying a prohibited drug which is called methoxymethamphetamine. When I sentence him I will take that into account and I sign the form under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 saying that I have taken that into account. That crime itself is very serious and Parliament has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment to it. 

4Briefly what happened is this. The Australia Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission were involved in a joint operation in July 2012. They had a number of people under surveillance. Those people did not include Mr Pham, but their investigations led them to his house in a street in Hinchinbrook. Mr Pham lived there with his 18 year old son and a friend. Each had their own bedroom. Mr Pham's bedroom had a lock on it. It was the only room with a lock although it was not locked at the time.

5On 25 July 2012 at about 7.00pm in the evening Australian Federal Police arrived with a search warrant. He was asked whether there were any drugs and he said ""Some drugs in my room"". Police searched the house and they found some drugs in his jacket pocket in his wardrobe. There was a snaplock bag which in turn contained five smaller snaplock bags. Each snaplock bag contained a number of capsules. In all there were 37. In the top drawer of the wardrobe they found $4,000 in cash. Under the bed they found a metal chest which was locked with a combination lock. 

6Police opened the lock using bolt cutters and inside they found 16 clear snaplock bags and 4 freezer bags. Each of the freezer bags contained a white crystalline substance. There were 20 bags in all. The substances were analysed later on and found to be methylamphetamine. The overall weight was just over 19 kilograms. The purity was between 76 and 77 per cent. A large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine is 1 kilogram. This was almost 20 times the large commercial quantity. The net weight of the pure methylamphetamine was about 14½ kilograms. 

7The 37 capsules were analysed and found to be a drug called 4-methoxymethamphetamine and the purity there was between 50 and 63 per cent. There were just over 8 grams and the indictable quantity is 5 grams. 

8Police found in the kitchen a box containing a large number of clipseal bags and some scales. They found some more scales in the laundry. 

9The wholesale value of the methylamphetamine is estimated to be between $3 million and $5.8 million. The street value is between $7 million and $29 million. The document I have been reading from is called the statement of facts and is part of exhibit A and it records that the ""evidence in the police brief does not establish that the offender's role was any greater than that of a warehouser"" in respect of the drugs found in the chest of drawers. 

10It is now important to say something personally about Mr Pham. First he is a person who has no criminal record whatsoever. Mr J Peluso of counsel who appeared for Mr Pham called his client to give evidence. He is 41 years old. He was arrested on 25 July 2012 and has been in custody since then on this charge. In custody he has been employed. Before he went into custody he was working in a bakery for 5 days a week. He has a history of using recreational drugs since he was in his thirties. He ceased completely when he was in his late thirties because his son arrived from Vietnam to live with him and to go to school. However, he occasionally still used recreational drugs on special occasions such as birthdays. He said that the capsules in his jacket were given to him by a friend in preparation for his forthcoming birthday for use by him and other friends. It is therefore obvious that he proposed to share those drugs. 

11He was asked by Mr Peluso to explain how the chest came to be under the bed in his room. He said the person whom he bought recreational drugs from needed someone to keep what were described as damaged goods which could not be sold. That person was prepared to pay the keeper $4,000. Mr Pham understood that the damaged goods were something like crystal ice. The man brought the trunk the next day and Mr Pham kept it under his bed. The man said he would come back and despite Mr Pham contacting him a number of times, he did not. The chest or trunk had been under his bed for two months when he was arrested. Mr Pham thought it would be okay keeping the chest for a short time. The trunk was secured by a combination and he himself did not know the combination and never opened it. 

12He kept the lock on his door for privacy he said. He rented the place where they were staying for $350 a week. His only asset was an old car and his only income was from working nights for five days a week in the bakery clearing about $100 a night. In the end he had just enough to cover his expenses.

13His son is the child of a relationship he had with a woman when he, Mr Pham, was on his way to Australia. He arranged to bring his son to Australia to complete his education. The boy was in Year 12 at Busby High School at the time. They still have a close relationship and his son visits him in gaol. He is Mr Pham's only child. His son has had to leave school and is on unemployment benefits looking for work. He cannot remember anything about the scales which were found in the house. He expressed his regret for what he acknowledged he had done and that it was wrong.

14Cross-examined by Mr D I Curran who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Pham acknowledged that he had received the chest some 2 months before the police arrived. He was not prepared to identify the person from whom he had received the chest because of fears for the safety of his son. He said the $4,000 found by the police was the payment made for keeping the chest. He acknowledged that he had kept that $4,000 for two months without spending it. 

15Mr Peluso tendered a report from a psychologist who had examined Mr Pham. Her name is Ann-Marie De Santa Brigida. She noted the history of substance abuse since the age of 30, initially experimenting with ecstasy but also using cocaine and alcohol which she found encouraged an unhealthy gambling habit. Ms De Santa Brigida did not regard Mr Pham as having a substance abuse disorder but concluded that he had high anxiety and depression related mainly to his custody and prospects. She said there was no evidence of any undiagnosed mood disorder or psychosis or personality disorder. She thought that he had a low risk of re-offending. 

16Mr Pham's employment is confirmed in a document tendered by Mr Peluso from the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre.

17In their submissions Mr Curran took me to a series of cases and Mr Peluso took me to a series of cases as well. I should note what they are. There was MacDonnell [2002] NSWCCA 34; (2002) 128 A Crim R 44, R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78; (2005) 152 A Crim R 462, R v El Helou [2010] NSWCCA 111; (2010) 267 ALR 734, R v Mahmud [2010] NSWCCA 219, Robinson v R [2012] NSWCCA 26 and Ayik v R [2013] NSWCCA 119. I will say something more about the cases later.

18Mr Curran observed that the weight, being 19 kilograms, was almost 20 kilograms above the large commercial quantity with a high purity. He argued that the courts regarded warehouser of drugs, which Mr Pham was, as serious offenders. He acknowledged that Mr Pham had pleaded guilty at an early time and indicated that the prosecution would not cavil with an appropriate discount being 25 per cent because of that plea of guilty. He observed that it could well be a case where the standard non-parole period would be appropriate. 

19Mr Peluso on the other hand argued that the case of Ayik was factually similar to this case and reminded me that since the High Court decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 120 CLR 120 the standard non-parole period is just one factor and not the determining factor. He invited me to accept his client as reasonably credible. I at first would have some difficulty in accepting that proposition because of the fact that he had had the chest for 2 months and because of the presence of the plastic bags and the money, I would regard it as unlikely that he would have $4,000 stored for 2 months without spending it. However, Mr Peluso made some significant arguments about there being none of the usual trappings or indicia of a significant involvement in the actual supply of drugs. I think he was right in those submissions. There was no evidence of any telephone intercepts involving Mr Pham dealing in drugs. The only amount of money found was $4,000 which is a relatively small amount compared to some of the amounts which are found in other cases. 

20There were no trappings of wealth. He lived in a rented house paying $350 a week. The house itself was not fitted with any surveillance such as cameras or bars. There were no documents which are sometimes found relating to drugs, keeping records of monies or lists or amounts supplied. There were no firearms to protect the house. There was no suggestion that Mr Pham was involved in the transportation of the drugs. His role was limited. The door itself was unlocked when the police arrived and the chest had to be broken into. There was no evidence of fingerprints or DNA from Mr Pham on any of the packages. 

21Mr Peluso argued that all of these were consistent with his client's evidence, giving his account about how he came by the chest full of drugs. I accept that submission and to my mind he demonstrates on the balance of probabilities that his client's account is true. He pointed out that his client has no criminal record and has had steady employment. His client's prospects of rehabilitation are reasonably good. He did not have a substance abuse issue. His son is waiting for his father to be released. A psychologist assessed him as a low risk.

22Mr Peluso also added that there were special circumstances for adjusting the normal ratio between a full sentence and the non-parole period. Normally a non-parole period is 75 per cent of a full sentence. He said these special circumstances were the lengthy amount of time he would obviously have to spend in gaol - which Mr Peluso frankly and correctly acknowledged - and that it was his client's first custodial sentence and that he would need supervision on parole. 

23I found four of the cases referred to by Mr Peluso and Mr Curran to be helpful. Three of them concerned large commercial quantities, namely, Ayik, Mahmud and El Helou. In Ayik the offender was convicted of supplying 28 kilograms of heroin with a street value of over $30 million. He or she had also pleaded guilty but had stored the drugs for only 3 days. That offender received a sentence of 9 years. In Mahmud the amount involved was relatively small, 1.78 kilograms, but methamphetamine. The Court found that the offender was providing a repository for another to store the drugs. The purity was also very low, just over 2 per cent. That offender also received a sentence of 9 years. In El Helou the drug was pseudoephedrine and was almost 260 kilograms. The offender had been involved as a transporter and warehouser but for only 2 days. El Helou had pleaded guilty as well. Robinson was of less value because it concerned a commercial quantity rather than a large commercial quantity of MDMA, although the offender had prior convictions and for drug supply and had served custody and the conviction was the result of a verdict. 

24I have taken those cases into account. I also take into account Mr Pham's age and the fact that he has no criminal record. I take into account his evidence and what was said by the psychologist. 

25I first have to make some assessment of how serious this offence is compared to other offences. The amount was almost 20 times, specifically 19 times, the large commercial quantity. I regard it as being a very high purity and the storage was not a matter of days or weeks but for 2 months. I regard the case as falling comfortably within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. I should have added on the other hand that there was no evidence of actual supply. Despite that, I regard it as falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 

26In fixing a sentence it is important for me to keep in mind that Parliament has fixed a maximum of life imprisonment to this crime. Not only that, it has fixed a standard non-parole period of 15 years. I also need to take into account the other offence which is an offence of supplying a prohibited drug which Parliament regards as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment. 

27Taking all these matters into account I would regard an appropriate overall starting sentence as one of 18 years imprisonment. However, Mr Pham has pleaded guilty. He has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. I would discount that sentence. A discount of that sentence by 25 per cent would produce a sentence of 13½ years imprisonment. I propose to round down his sentence to 13 years imprisonment which will be his sentence.

28The non-parole period envisaged by the sentencing legislation is usually 75 per cent. In this case it would be just over 10 years imprisonment. Because of the special circumstances referred to by Mr Peluso I propose to reduce his non-parole period to 9 years imprisonment. 

HIS HONOUR: I will sentence you now, Mr Pham.

29First I convict you of the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. I fix a non-parole period of 9 years to commence when you went into custody on 25 July 2012. That will expire on 24 July 2021. The balance of the term is 4 years which will commence on 25 July 2021 and expire on 24 July 2025. The first date on which you will be eligible for parole is 24 July 2021. Once you are released on parole you will be still serving your sentence in the community until 24 July 2025. Have a seat.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Curran and Mr Peluso, any matters that I need to attend to?
CURRAN: I'd seek the standard drug destruction order.

30Yes, I make that order under s 39P of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.

CURRAN: There's also an application by the Crown to confiscate the proceeds of the crime which in this case is the $4,000 fine. I have a notice of motion with attached short minutes of order. If your Honour could sign those orders. I understand it's by consent or certainly not opposed.
PELUSO: It is.
CURRAN: If I could have a signed copy returned to my file.

31I make the order contained in the short minutes of forfeiture order signed and sealed by me and dated today. There is a copy for each party.

CURRAN: I've provided a draft copy to my friend. I only need one signed copy for the Crown's file. The others can stay on the Court.
HIS HONOUR: We'll put that, one on the file. One back to Mr Curran. I don't need the third. I'll give the exhibits back to my associate. Anything else?
CURRAN: No.
HIS HONOUR: Mr Pham can be taken down.

		06 September 2013",2013-06-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2706605,R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 729,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The accused is due to stand trial commencing on 17 June 2013 on an indictment charging that she murdered her daughter Kiesha between 10 and 18 July 2010. She was arraigned on that charge on 2 May 2013 and pleaded guilty to manslaughter but not guilty of murder. The Crown has not accepted that plea in satisfaction of the indictment. On 8 May 2013 the accused filed an application pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 for trial by judge alone. She relies upon affidavits sworn on 8 May and 28 May 2013 by her solicitor. The application is opposed.

2Section132 is in the following relevant terms:

""132 Orders for trial by Judge alone 

(1) An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a 'trial by judge order'). 

(2) The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone. 

(3) If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order. 

(4) If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so. 

(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness. 

(6) The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner.

(7)...""

3It is convenient and efficient to observe that s 132(4) is the principal provision requiring consideration in the circumstances of the present application. Some attention is also given to s 132(5).

Background

4The accused and Christopher Weippeart were in a de facto relationship for a period from approximately 2002 until 2005. The accused gave birth to a son on 6 February 2003. He died from sudden infant death syndrome on 23 March 2003 aged six weeks. The deceased was born on 22 April 2004.

5On 4 July 2005 the deceased was admitted to Mt Druitt Hospital overnight for observation with a bite mark. The accused was subsequently charged with assault upon her and pleaded guilty. She was placed on a bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to be of good behaviour for 12 months. The accused and Christopher Weippeart separated after this offence. The deceased went from hospital into the custody of Mr Weippeart and his mother, and then into the care of the Department of Community Services.

6Following the separation, the accused formed a relationship with Robert Smith in 2006. He was introduced to the deceased during the course of DoCS approved visits. The deceased was returned to the care of the accused on 23 December 2006. Thereafter the accused and Smith lived together with the deceased in a unit at Mt Druitt. Christopher Weippeart had little involvement in raising the deceased. The accused and Smith had two children of their own born respectively on 9 February 2008 and 7 July 2010. The deceased occupied one bedroom of the unit while the accused and Smith shared the other bedroom with their two children.

7On 1 August 2010 the accused called ""000"" to report that the deceased was missing from the home. An extensive police operation was undertaken in an attempt to locate her. On 22 April 2011 the accused and Smith were arrested leaving a site in bushland at Shalvey at which the buried remains of the deceased were subsequently discovered. The disappearance of the deceased had attracted considerable media attention and publicity in the meantime. That attention continued after the accused and Smith were arrested and charged, and has in fact continued right up until the present.

8It is the contention of the accused that the media coverage and publicity, as well as the extensive dissemination of material on the Internet, have been so intense and so pervasive that no prospective juror is likely to have been uninfluenced by it and that any jurors who may be empanelled will be incapable of withstanding the temptation to refer to it. It is inherent in that contention that jury directions from me will not be adequate or sufficient either to prevent impermissible activity by jurors or to eradicate any preconceptions and prejudices that they may already have acquired. The accused is concerned that a fair trial by a jury cannot be achieved in the circumstances.

9In that setting, the accused articulates in summary the following matters in support of her application. They are as follows:

1. It is likely that a member or members of the jury will have seen, and already formed an adverse view of the accused from, the extensive publicity this matter has received in all forms of the media and particularly the discussion sites on the Internet.

2. The circumstances of the alleged offence (including the burning and burial of the deceased's body) are likely to engender prejudicial feelings of revulsion and antipathy in the members of the jury towards the accused.

3. It is anticipated that the pathology evidence might give rise to emotive responses in lay people, so as to prejudice the ability of jury members to consider the weight of the evidence impartially.

4. It has been publicly revealed that the accused's first-born child died from SIDS and that a police investigation into the circumstances of that child's death was conducted after the death of the deceased.

5. Taking all of these matters into account, the accused does not think that she would be able to get a fair trial with a jury and she wishes to be tried by a judge alone.

The legislative framework

10Section 132 commenced on 14 January 2011. It was introduced to remove the former veto power held by the prosecution. Under the new provision, if the prosecutor does not agree to an accused's request for a judge alone order, the Court may make the order ""if it is in the interests of justice to do so"". In his Second Reading Speech, the Attorney-General said this:

""The bill further amends the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to implement a new system for determining when a trial should proceed before a judge sitting alone without a jury. Section 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 allows the accused person in criminal proceedings to be tried by a judge alone if the judge is satisfied that the accused has sought legal advice in relation to the election and the Director of Public Prosecutions consents to the making of the election. The Chief Judge of the District Court proposed in late 2009 that the Director of Public Prosecution's veto power be removed from s 132 by allowing a court to settle the dispute if the prosecution and defence cannot agree on the issue of trial by a judge alone. Judge-alone trials are appropriate in a limited number of circumstances. For example, they may be appropriate where there are concerns that cannot be overcome regarding pre-trial publicity, or where the evidence of the trial is likely to be highly technical.''


11Prior to the introduction of this legislation, if the prosecutor did not agree to the making of a judge alone order, an accused's only recourse was to apply for a permanent stay of the proceedings. This was rarely successful because the courts tended to be of the view that the prosecution's decision not to agree to an order being made was a matter of prosecutorial discretion with which the courts should not interfere. In R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; (2008) 72 NSWLR 258 at [16], Spigelman CJ said: 

""[16] This Court has had occasion to assess adverse pre-trial publicity in a number of cases, being publicity of a character, of a duration and of an intensity which was at least equal, in many cases, to the publicity in the present case. Applications for a permanent stay have failed in the most sensational of cases: Anita Cobby, Ivan Milat, Phillip Bell, the Childers Backpacker Hostel fire, Lucy Dudko, William D'Arcy, Bruce Burrell. (See Murphy v The Queen [1989] HCA 28; (1989) 167 CLR 94; R v Milat (Court of Criminal Appeal, 26 February 1998, unreported); R v Bell (Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 October 1998, unreported); Long v R [2002] QSC 54; (2002) 128 A Crim R 11; affirmed on appeal [2003] QCA 77; (2003) 138 A Crim R 103; R v Dudko [2002] NSWCCA 336; (2002) 132 A Crim R 371; R v D 'Arcy [2003] QCA 124; (2003) 140 A Crim R 303; R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 185.)""


12These authorities are now of limited assistance in the light of the particular terms of the new provisions. 

13The effect of the new provisions was considered at length by McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; (2012) 217 A Crim R 1. In that case, the Crown appealed against the decision of Solomon DCJ to grant a trial by judge order as a result of the possible prejudice flowing to the accused because he was Muslim, he was charged with an assault on a female family member and because the Crown asserted that he acted as he did because he held ""antiquated"" views about women. In allowing the Crown appeal, the Chief Judge considered the effect of the words ""in the interests of justice"" in the context of an application for a trial by judge order. His Honour referred to the decision in Pambula District Hospital v Herriman (1988) 14 NSWLR 387, where the issue had been considered in respect of civil trials. The effect of the decision in Pambula Hospital was that, before a jury should be dispensed with in a civil trial, it was ""necessary to show grounds which are particular to the case in hand."" His Honour was of the opinion that the legislation did not create a presumption in favour of a trial by jury. His Honour said the following at [96]:

""[96] This appeal raises questions of fundamental importance which the divergence of views in previous decisions confirms are not readily resolved. Although s 131 provides for trial by jury 'except as otherwise provided', I do not think that the section has the effect of creating a 'presumption' that the trial should be with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on an accused person. Although the accused person carries an evidentiary onus the court does not determine where the interests of justice lie by requiring the evidence to rise to a level by which a 'presumption' of trial by jury is displaced. Each mode of trial has its particular characteristics and, accordingly, depending on all of the circumstances relating to the particular case, the court may conclude that the interests of justice are best served by a judge-alone trial rather than trial by a jury. Of course, absent an application by an accused person, the default position will be that the trial must take place with a jury. And, no doubt, when considering where the interests of justice lie, it will be relevant that where the trial involves an issue which may be informed by community standards or expectations the interests of justice may be best served by utilising a jury of laypeople. Subsection (5) acknowledges this consideration. However, I see no reason why the legislation otherwise requires particular weight to be given to the fact that, absent an application for a judge-alone trial, the trial will be with a jury as opposed to by a judge alone. The question for the court is whether it considers it is in the interests of justice to make the order.""

14In agreeing with the orders proposed by his Honour, Hidden J in Belghar commented as follows at [118]:

""[118] I think it is unhelpful to speak about a presumption or an onus when an application is made by an accused for trial by judge alone. The statutory scheme created by ss 131 and 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act is that a trial on indictment is normally by jury, and it is for the accused to raise material which might lead to the conclusion that it is in the interests of justice to depart from that mode of trial. It is then a matter for the judge to determine where the interests of justice lie in all the circumstances of the case, and the approach of the parties to the matter should not be adversarial. While the history of trial by jury suggests that the institution has been for the protection of the accused, it is clear that s 132(4) recognises that there is a community interest in trial by jury which in a particular case might override the accused's preference for a judge alone trial. So much is spelt out in subs (5). To adopt the words of Chesterman JA in Fardon, an accused cannot have a trial by judge alone 'for the asking'.""

15There have been several other cases since Belghar both in New South Wales and elsewhere. These are referred to in some detail later in these reasons. It is important in advance of that, however, to consider at least some of the material to which the accused has directed attention and with respect to which she has raised her current concerns. The existence of this material, and its ready accessibility to members of the public both now and in the past, is not in dispute.

The offending material - some examples

16The following material became part of the evidence before me in this application. It forms part of the several annexures to the first affidavit of the accused's solicitor.

17Annexures ""A"", ""B"" and ""C"" to the affidavit contain newspaper articles and photographs from the www.news.com.au website. From this material, it is apparent that many articles about this matter have been published in hard copy in at least The Australian, The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Telegraph, The Advertiser, The Sunday Mail, The Messenger, The Herald-Sun, Perth Now and The Courier Mail. These articles have been published between the time of the deceased's disappearance in August 2010 and May 2013. The same articles have appeared electronically on the www.news.com.au website. There are also 144 photographs posted on the www.news.com.au ""Galleries"" link.

One subscriber, Marion Downing, responded to news that the accused had pleaded guilty to manslaughter on 2 May 2013 by saying, ""She was trying to get herself a reduced sentence by admitting to manslaughter rather than being found guilty of murder. She continues to be self-serving.""

2. A printout of the Facebook ""Help Find Kiesha Abraham [sic] Organisation"" site. As at 2 May 2013, it had 753 ""Likes"" and one person was ""talking about this"" [at that time on the Facebook site].

(The updated figures are contained in the accused's solicitor's second affidavit).

23Annexure ""K"" to the affidavit is a printout from the ""Aussie Criminals and Crooks"" website, containing posts from ""Robbo"". That particular contributor offers various opinions, including:

""The mother and stepfather charged with murdering Kiesha have said they want to leave jail to attend her funeral. How bloody dare they, they would not make it back alive. Do they realise how despised they are? Do they accept the position they are in? The evidence is overwhelming. These maggots need to die in jail, not leave it. For nothing, anytime, anywhere anyhow unless it is in a coffin!"" 


24Annexure ""L"" to the affidavit is a printout from the ""Child Abuse Pages - Kiesha Weippeart (Abrahams)"" pages of the ""ANGELIZD's Place"" website. The pages contain multiple images of angels and love hearts, and photographs of the deceased, the bush site where her remains were found, memorials to her, her funeral and a photograph of her brother's headstone.

25Annexure ""M"" is a printout from the ""Bad Breeders"" website. There is a photograph of the accused with the caption, ""Kristi Abrahams is a foul cock-gobbler and a murderer"". On the same page is a photograph of Robert Smith with the caption, ""Robert Smith is a piece of shit child-killer"". On the following page is a photograph of both the accused and Smith, with the caption, ""Maggots crawling through dog shit. Both should be infected with choler""'. The website contains the following statement:

""The cunt-plug [Smith] was arrested that same month and charged with manslaughter and gross negligence in December 2011. His dickwarmer and Kiesha's incubator [the accused] was arrested and charged with manslaughter and being an accessory after the fact, as she knew her dildo had neglected Kiesha and knew damn well what had happened to her and where she was, but lied to the authorities to protect her toy penis. During her trial she chatted happily with her bedwarmer and had her neck tattoos clearly visible. This isn't a woman mourning the death of her child, this is a trampy bitch who couldn't give two shits about her child dying and who cares more about her pet penis! Both of them should be eaten by dingoes!"" 


26Annexure ""N"" to the affidavit contains a printout from the annamaria.com.blog.spot website. It is a brief and basically accurate summary of newspaper reports.

27Annexure ""O"" to the affidavit contains a 42 page printout from ""The McCann Files"" website (so named for the missing British child Madeleine McCann). It contains a collection of newspaper articles from 1 August 2010 to 24 April 2011, shortly after the arrests of the accused and Smith. The last article stated:

""Grim details of little Kiesha Abrahams' life in the care of her mother and stepfather have emerged following the discovery of her remains in bushland. Detectives are expected to include in their brief of evidence witness statements alleging that Kiesha was the subject of harsh, brutal discipline and was sometimes 'flogged'.
At other times, she was allegedly forced to put her hands on her head and stand in the comer of a room for hours. Police records show the Abrahams family had 36 complaints lodged with the police. No charges were laid.""


28Annexure ""P"" to the affidavit contains a 20-page printout from the ""Psychic Tarot Insights: Kiesha Abrahams"" page of the empathysinsights.blog.spot. It includes posts of tarot readings of the deceased's disappearance and possible whereabouts, including comments as to psychic ""sightings"" of her.

29Annexure ""Q"" to the affidavit contains a 48-page printout from the blog.eyesforlies.com website. On the website, posts have been made by ""Eyes"". One such post is as follows:

""News outlets are reporting that police in Sydney are looking to find the source of six cash payments of $500 and $600 made to Kristi Abrahams and Robert Smith in the weeks leading up to Kiesha's disappearance. This is an interesting twist in the case. If the news stories are true, everyone will be questioning if Kiesha's mum and step-dad sold their daughter in exchange for money. Could she have been sold into the sex trade? It's horrible to think about."" 


30Contributors have posted over 170 comments in response to posts by ""Eyes"", including comments such as the following:

CarlyQ - ""Apparently it's been reported that before Kiesha there was a brother, Aiden, who died when he was six weeks old. The police are looking into that death again. This does not bode well for little Kiesha at all."" 

cate - ""so sad this whole story.who many more stories of abused kids do we have to read? off topic- the number of abuse/neglect incidents towards young children has skyrocketed in oz since the baby bonus 'free money for babies' benefits were introduced.the government should not give bonuses to women/girls on welfare, their on welfare for a reason-duh!cos they cant look after themselves responsibly, also it has bn documented that unstable women have been pressured into getting pregnant by their bogan boyfriends to the $5000+ bonuses.its easier than getting a loan from a bank for them.the resulting kids often end up in foster care.shame on our p.c government for not limiting the bonus to non-welfare women, it's a social disaster...""

""Kiesha also had a brother Ayden born in 2003 but who died a few weeks after his birth. Mr Weippeart wanted the files from Ayden's death reopened but a coroner ruled the child died of SIDS so the file will not be reopened...

As for the sad excuse for a mother and her live-in penis, neither Abrahams nor Smith chose to appear in court or via a video link....
On April 24th Kristi Abrahams appeared in Penrith District court via video link claiming to be distressed by the situation which attracted an outraged crowd in support of the innocent little girl who was robbed of a future. I hope she enjoys prison; then again the outrage in the community the bitch is probably safer behind bars... This case left a mark on me.

I remember when Kiesha first went missing, seeing an innocent beautiful little girl missing from a suburb not far from mine, watching her mother plead for information.

Now we know that she knew where her little girl was and that she wasn't coming back. The fact that this vile creature took part in stuffing her own daughter into a suitcase and burying her in a shallow grave, even though the little girl was her own flesh and blood, makes me furious.

HOW DARE SHE? WHY SHOW ANY REMORSE OR GUILT AFTER SO LONG? Was that bitch so damn stupid it took 9 months for her to feel some kind of guilt or remorse? Seriously... WTF was through that bitches mind? IT'S TOO LITTLE TOO DAMN LATE!!!

I really wish the two sad excuses for humans decide to open up and admit to what they did so Kiesha's family can get some closure. Luckily our legal system here in NSW Australia is pretty good, we don't have the death penalty but they will probably get life in prison with a chance of parole in 25 years... hopefully they get a nice little note on their file saying never to be released.

But I'd personally prefer if they were both be stuffed in suitcases and buried alive to burn in hell for all eternity.

RIP little Kiesha, I hope you know how many people love you.

In response to a post from Rubadubadoobag, who expressed the opinion that Kiesha's death might have been ""a tragic accident rather than a sadistic or wilful murder"" (at p.796), aus57 wrote - ""I disagree with what your saying Rubadubadoobag. When someone murders a child they automatically get a free pass to hell. With this situation it might have been an 'accident' [i highly doubt it] but they decided to lie and pretend like they were really distressed to the police, media and the public when all along they knew what had happened. I don't believe this is manslaughter. They lied and lied when they had so many chances to come clean, they hid her body in a suitcase and then set that alight to cover their tracks. They should go to prison for a really long time even just for the fact that they didn't give Kiesha the proper burial she deserved. A fist should never be raised to anyone let alone a child. They are the most defensless people in the world. They deserve love and attention."" 

Derek Prudence- ""... Note, they are *both* charged with murder. We do not have the concept of 'counts' over here, so it is just one 'count', and it attracts life imprisonment. They were both party to (a) several beatings (b) ongoing maltreatment (c) severe punishment... which culminated in her death. Then there is the mother biting her so badly that she was hospitalised. All evidenced. So they should have no problem establishing intent (same as the link above). Now whether the specific event was *intended* to kill her, or the death unintended and a result of a bad beating, does not matter in the context of all the evidence provide. There are also issues with neglect, failing to provide protection for a child, which we will see added as the case progresses, but it doesn't matter right now. One way or the other, they are both responsible for dealing with a child criminally over a long period. Even it is proved that one did the killing, and the other stood by, and assisted with the disposition of the corpse, that other will end up getting 20 years instead of 25..."" 

Derek Prudence- ""The police (not Weippeart) opened a new investigation into the death of the second child. It is not the coroners business, it is the polices (that SIDS death was not suspicious at the time so there was no inquest or autopsy). Our police are worthy of our trust. It does look like she murdered both of them, so that the 'new' family is exclusively Smith's. Kiesha was hospitalised for a very severe bite when she was little, and her mother was charged with assault. As I understand it, that was before the live-in bed-warmer came into the picture. This biting of children seems to be a thing that is very common with child murderers, at least from the stories on PYSIH. Infantile narcissists, all of them.

During the nine months, their were several opportunities for the mother to show she cared, in interviews and the like, and she came across as a narcissistic bitch every time. It was always about her, not the 'missing' child. Which of course galvanised the community and the police."" 

citysoup - ""Kiesha's bio dad is dead... police wouldn't say much about his cause of death other than it was not suspicious.

Submissions

32The accused has expressed a desire to be tried by judge alone. She is of the opinion that her trial would be prejudiced if she were to be tried by a jury. Her opinion is one of the considerations to be taken into account in determining whether a ""trial by judge"" order should be made: R v Belghar at [99], [105] - [106]); Arthurs v The State of Western Australia [2007] WASC 182 at [79] - [80].

33The accused has also submitted that it is likely that a member or members of the jury will have seen, and already formed an adverse view of the accused from, the extensive publicity this matter has received in all forms of the media and particularly the discussion sites on the Internet. The evidence relating to the number and nature of the Internet hits in respect of the accused and the death of the deceased is too voluminous to summarise. However, it is apparent from the samples of this material that the discussions on the Internet have a number of different (but all prejudicial) themes relating to the accused. They appear to be, or at least to include, the following:

1. The accused is guilty of murder.
2. The accused pleaded guilty to manslaughter only to get a reduced sentence.
3. Any distress the accused showed in response to the deceased's disappearance and death was self-serving.
4. The accused's character is evil.
5. The accused should receive the death penalty or she should be killed in gaol.
6. The accused subjected the deceased to a lifetime of abuse.
7. The accused sold the deceased for sexual services and in return received a number of payments of $500 and $600.
8. There were at least 40 complaints to the police about the accused's treatment of her children.
9. The police now think the accused's son did not die from SIDS and that the accused had most likely killed him as well.
10. The accused killed both of her children born of her relationship with Chris Weippeart because she only wanted the children born of Robert Smith.
11. The accused indirectly caused the death of Chris Weippeart.

34Many of the discussion sites describe the accused in highly derogatory language. They also include vile and obscene references to her that are potentially if not actually inflammatory.

35A perusal of the Internet and the websites establishes that there have been hundreds of thousands of items published about the deceased, the accused and Robert Smith. There have also been many thousands of hits on this material and comments made. It is apparent that these hits are not of purely historical interest, in the sense that they were confined to milestones such as the days after the deceased's so-called disappearance, the finding of her body or the charging of the accused and Robert Smith. The number of hits on the search criteria ""kristi Abrahams"", ""kiesha Abrahams"" and ""kiesha weippeart"" has increased very significantly in the 24 days from 2 May 2013 to 26 May 2013. The number of hits on the search criteria ""kiesha weippeart"" has increased by about 700 percent in just 24 days. The accused contends that one possible explanation for this is that the deceased, who was previously known publicly as Kiesha Abrahams, was named on the accused's indictment as Kiesha Weippeart. This is in the context of media reports of the accused being re-arraigned on 2 May 2013 and Smith being sentenced on 3 May 2013.

36The greatly increased number of hits suggests that there is a very sizeable part of the community that is currently following the publicity surrounding the accused's trial, and that many thousands of people are following this publicity on the Internet. This material is still readily accessible to any potential juror with access to the Internet. Given the volume of the material, and the number of different websites involved, the accused contends that it is not reasonably possible for this Court to order that the material be removed. In any event, potential jurors are likely to have already seen or to have heard about some of it at least.

37Although any jury would be given a direction as to improper use of the Internet in the context of this trial, the accused submitted that with the very considerable publicity the matter has already received, it is entirely foreseeable that at least one member of the jury might search the Internet looking for references to the accused and the offence contrary to that direction or in spite of it.

38It therefore becomes correspondingly impossible for the accused properly to exercise her right to challenge potential jurors when there is no mechanism to ascertain whether they might actually have accessed any of the websites containing derogatory material about her, or whether they really do hold an adverse opinion about her. Although the panel of potential jurors will be asked to consider whether there is any reason why they might not bring an impartial mind to their deliberations, it is not difficult to see that a person on the panel might have his or her own reasons for not disclosing a prejudice against the accused.

39Many of the comments posted on the Internet are based on nothing more than unfounded rumour or innuendo. It is anticipated that in the course of its deliberations, the jury would be asked to draw inferences as to the accused's behaviour towards the deceased. The jury should fairly draw those inferences only from the evidence at the trial. In light of the sheer volume of adverse public comment in this case, it is likely to be exceedingly difficult for a lay juror completely to ignore his or her own preconceptions of the accused's guilt and/or the nature of Internet comments they might have seen when considering the inferences that could fairly be drawn.

40The accused submitted that the circumstances of the alleged offence, including evidence as to the burning and burial of the deceased's body, are likely to engender prejudicial feelings of revulsion and antipathy towards her in the members of a jury. The comments posted on the Internet about the circumstances of the alleged offence attest to the very intense and resoundingly negative reaction to the accused that has already been engendered in the community. These comments are found in the evidence. The number, nature and consistent tone of these comments demonstrate the extent to which a large part of the community already harbours and is prepared to express hateful and prejudicial feelings of revulsion and antipathy towards the accused.

41It is also anticipated that the pathology evidence might give rise to emotive responses in laypeople, so as to prejudice the ability of jury members impartially to consider the weight of the evidence. It is anticipated that pathology evidence relating to the deceased's remains will be explored at the trial. It is the Crown's case that one or more of the deceased's teeth were probably broken during the course of the act that caused her death, so at the hands of the accused, and that she probably inflicted previous bone fractures on the deceased, which were at various stages of healing at the time of her death.

42Examination and cross-examination in respect of these alleged injuries would necessarily involve the examination of post-mortem photographs of the deceased's skeletal remains. The Crown concedes so much. Some of the photographs of the bones show evidence of burning. These photographs are likely to induce a strong emotional reaction in the viewer, particularly in a layperson not accustomed to seeing depictions of what occurs during an autopsy, and particularly in the context of the other Crown evidence of the deceased's appearance prior to her death.

43It has been publicly revealed that the accused's first-born child died from SIDS and that a police investigation into the circumstances of that child's death was conducted after the death of the deceased. Publicity concerning SIDS deaths has been abroad in the media for some considerable time. The accused contends that they are sometimes regarded with suspicion, perhaps because it is not possible by definition to identify an organic cause of death in such cases.

44After the deceased was reported missing and before her body was found, articles were published in the main daily newspapers to the effect that the accused and Christopher Weippeart had a son, who died from SIDS at the age of six weeks. It was reported that the police had learned of his death during their investigation into the deceased's disappearance and had asked the Coroner to reopen the investigation into that child's death. The clear inference was that the police suspected the accused of also killing her son.

45The way in which this death has been discussed on Internet discussion sites and linked to the deceased's death is referred to in the evidence. Evidence as to his death would be inadmissible at the trial. There is no evidence that he died from anything other than SIDS. There is no evidence whatsoever of any causal link between his death and that of the deceased. The Crown quite obviously does not rely on tendency evidence in this regard. 

46There have been reports in the mainstream media of the recent police investigation into this boy's death. Any knowledge held by a juror concerning that investigation would be likely to prejudice the accused's right to a fair trial. The unfair inference is likely to be drawn that the accused killed both of her children. There is no effective means for the accused or the Court to determine whether potential jurors are aware of this death or, if they are, what effect that might have on their ability to consider all of the evidence at the trial with an open mind.

47There is also a reference in s 132(5) of the Act to ""objective community standards"". The accused has entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter on the dual bases that she committed an unlawful and dangerous act and that she failed to provide proper medical care to the deceased. Although the Crown rejected her guilty plea, it has served substantially to narrow the contested issues. It is anticipated that the accused's subjective intention at the time she committed the act of violence against the deceased and her failure to provide proper medical care will be the central issues at trial. The accused's subjective intention is not ""a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards"". She has admitted by her manslaughter plea that what she did was wrong in the terms of ""objective community standards"". Essentially, the only question remaining for determination is, ""What was the accused thinking when she did these things?""

48The accused finally sought to place considerable emphasis upon the decision in Arthurs. The Crown has indicated that it will rely on the decision in R v Sean Lee King [2013] NSWSC 448. In that matter, one of the accused's grounds for his application of a trial by judge order was that pre-trial media coverage and online discussion that was widely available contained information that would be inadmissible at trial and/or might prejudice the trial. In support of this ground, King's solicitor produced links to a total of ten articles published on the Internet, of which five related to the charge against the accused. The accused in this case contended that the evidentiary basis of her application is quite unlike that in R v King.

49Conceding that each application for a trial by judge order must be considered on its own facts, the accused sought to draw upon the similarity between her application and that considered in Arthurs. That case was considered and adopted by McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar. The Western Australian provisions relating to applications for judge alone trials are relevantly similar to those in this State.

50Arthurs involved the sexual assault and killing of an 8-year-old girl in a shopping centre toilet on 26 June 2006. The accused was a 21-year-old male. He made an application for a trial by judge alone because of the extensive publicity and negative Internet activity the matter attracted pre-trial. The prosecution did not agree to the making of the order. In granting King's application, Martin CJ said:

""[38] As I have mentioned, the solicitor's affidavit refers in very general terms to the proposition that the circumstances of the offence are likely to engender feelings of revulsion and antipathy towards Mr Arthurs. I have reviewed the details of the alleged offence in the prosecution brief and of the evidence that might be led at trial. It is neither necessary nor appropriate for me to detail the circumstances which would be revealed by the evidence at this point in the proceedings, except to note that some of the material is likely to have a profoundly disturbing effect, testing the emotional strength of anybody required to review it, whether juror or Judge.
...

[85]... There are, however, a number of factors which appear to me to support the proposition that a trial by Judge without jury is, in the circumstances of this case, in the interests of justice.

[86] Turning first to the pre-trial publicity, as I have mentioned, it is fair to categorise that publicity as extensive, continuous and in some respects extraordinary. Those extraordinary aspects include, perhaps most significantly, the continuing assertions of an extraordinary character made against Mr Arthurs from a variety of sources on the Internet and the television broadcast which has arguably prejudiced Mr Arthurs' ability to obtain a fair trial by jury.

[87] There are of course many cases dealing with the extent to which prejudice that might be occasioned by pre-trial publicity can be ameliorated by an appropriate warning and direction to the jury, and it is standard practice in Western Australia to direct juries that they should not make any access to the Internet to conduct any of their own inquiries in relation to any aspect of the case before them. However, there is, I think, room for doubt as to the efficacy of these processes, particularly in cases which have achieved the notoriety of this case. So in my opinion there is some weight in the proposition that there is a prospect that the fairness of Mr Arthurs' trial might be prejudiced by the extensive publicity to which I have referred if he is tried by a jury.

[88] The second factor which I take into account is the possible effect which the evidence as to the circumstances of the offence might have upon a jury. As I mentioned earlier, it is, I think, neither necessary nor appropriate for me to detail those circumstances other than to observe that the evidence is likely to test the emotional strength and fortitude of any person required to consider it in detail, whether juror or Judge.

[89] Despite their training and experience, it would, I think, be unwise to assume that Judges are any less vulnerable to human emotions and frailty than any other member of the community. However, it is in this context that an obligation to provide reasons appears to me to be of particular significance. Through the performance of that obligation, the accused person, the community and where necessary an appeal court can evaluate whether, and if so the extent to which emotion may have influenced the decision, at least to a greater extent than in the case of a jury verdict. That consideration seems to me to lend weighty support in this case to the proposition that trial by Judge without jury is in the interests of justice.

[90] A third factor which I take into account is allied to the second in that it draws upon the significance of the obligation to provide reasons in the event of a trial by Judge without jury. While it could not be said that the complexity and length of this trial is such that it would be burdensome on a jury, there are more than 70 prosecution witnesses named on the indictment, although we do not yet know how many of those witnesses are to be called. The latest estimate as to the length of trial I have received is one of ten days.

[91] I am, however, told by defence counsel that there are likely to be issues requiring the detailed evaluation of expert evidence, including expert pathological and psychiatric evidence. I accept though that it is difficult to be certain as to precisely the extent of that evidence at this stage.

[92] I do not for one moment suggest that those are issues which are beyond the capacity of a jury and although this is not a factor upon which I would place considerable weight, from my review of the prosecution brief there do appear to be aspects of this case in respect of which the delivery of reasoned decisions for judgment would be in the interests of justice.

[93] Bringing all these considerations together, starting from a position of neutrality as to the mode of trial to be adopted, it does not seem to me that in the particular circumstances of this case there are any particular factors which would support trial by jury. On the other hand, there are in my opinion three factors which support the conclusion that it is in the interests of justice for Mr Arthurs to be tried by a Judge without a jury, and I so direct.""

51The accused submitted that in all of these circumstances it was in the interests of justice for a trial by judge order to be made. She submitted in summary that her concerns about pre-trial publicity could not otherwise appropriately be overcome.

Consideration

Pre-trial publicity

52The uncontested evidence in this case shows that the events giving rise to the charges against the accused and Robert Smith have attracted considerable publicity. That has not been limited to the traditional news media outlets but has also extended to electronic publicity in the form of Internet posts and on-line exchanges. These questionable sources of (so-called) information thrive in circumstances and at a time in our development in which everybody must be taken to have unlimited access to them. They survive beyond the range of any appropriate regulation or monitoring capable of ensuring either their accuracy or their reliability. Their authors remain anonymous and unaccountable: their motives are unknown and often manifestly mischievous or malevolent. Regrettably in very many instances the ability of the authors of these questionable publications to express rational views about anything at all cannot be known or assessed and certainly cannot ever be assumed. The material referred to already in this case only serves to confirm and reinforce these concerns.

53Mainstream media outlets have traditionally taken an interest in criminal trials. They attract publicity and they receive it. It is often difficult to determine whether or not it is only sensational cases that are reported or whether it is only the reported cases that become sensational. I make that observation in the context that very little, if anything, that falls for consideration by courts and juries in the criminal justice system is novel, surprising or unique. Each case may be different in detail but few cases ever break entirely new ground.

54An appreciation of these matters is of importance in the present case. The accused is concerned that so much uncensored and inaccurate material has escaped into the public domain that she cannot be guaranteed a fair trial unless at least a trial by judge order is made. It is inherent in this proposition that it will not be possible to craft directions for jurors that will be adequate to eradicate or neutralise the possible but unknown consequences that might flow for the accused if any of this extraneous material is factored consciously or even unconsciously into their final decisions.

55McHugh J referred to this in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at 425 as follows:

""The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the common law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one - accused, trial judge or member of the public - could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves a jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state. Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials. It is of course true that, if a jury persists in returning a verdict that is contrary to law, the trial judge must accept it. But that only means in Lord Mansfield's words that, although '[i]t is the duty of the Judge ... to tell the jury how to do right ... they have it in their power to do wrong'.""

56Ms Manuell SC for the accused cautions against placing any reliance upon these or similar remarks as they were made in a different factual and legislative context. Although I accept the accuracy of that submission, it seems to me that the applicability of his Honour's remarks is not accordingly constrained. The theory and practice must be that for as long as juries remain as part of the criminal justice system, their utility and reliability in general terms must be taken as given. Although some overseas jurisdictions take a somewhat different approach, there is no way of ever knowing whether or not a judge's directions have been followed by any or all jurors in a particular case, or even whether they have been understood. It follows as a matter of policy if not logic that, subject to rights of appeal, directions to juries by judges are taken to be adequate and sufficient to guide jurors to determine issues of fact in accordance with their oaths and according to law.

57The Crown has submitted that any prejudice arising from the existence of the material referred to by the accused can and would be cured by judicial warning. It is inherent in that submission that some prejudice will or may flow from the existence of this material at large in the community in the ways that the accused has emphasised. Indeed, the Crown accepted in terms that some of the material was both damaging and unjustified. However, the Crown relies upon a line of authority, all predating s 132 of the Act, in support of its contention that any consequent prejudice can and should be cured by judicial direction: see, for example, Gilbert at 425; R v Milat (NSWCCA 26 February 1998, unreported); R v Bell (NSWCCA 8 October1998, unreported); Long v R [2002] QSC 054; (2002) 128 A Crim R 11; R v Richards [1999] NSWCCA 114; (1999) 107 A Crim R 318; R v Dudko [2002] NSWCCA 336; (2002) 132 A Crim R 371; R v D'Arcy [2003] QCA 124; (2003) 140 A Crim R 303; R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 185; R v Jamal.

58These issues and the need constantly to monitor and refine directions that have traditionally been given to juries in such circumstances were helpfully referred to by Bellew J in R v King at [56] - [61] as follows:

""[56] The potential impact, upon a criminal trial, of articles published on the Internet has been the subject of judicial observation. In R v K (2003) 59 NSWLR 431 Wood CJ at CL said (at 448; [80]-[82]):

'The case is one of potential ongoing importance, having regard to the extent of the information which is now available on the internet, concerning criminal investigations and trials, not only via online media reports and services, but also via legal databases and the judgment systems of the Courts. The problem is compounded by the greater familiarity which the current generation has with the use of information technology, and the ever reducing cost of acquiring and using that technology.

It may well become the case, as a matter of habit arising out of the way that ordinary affairs are conducted, that the inevitable reaction of any person who is summonsed as a juror, will be to undertake an online search in relation to the case, to ascertain what it may involve.

It is not possible to place any practicable limit on the content or the extent of the material available in this way, and the powers of the Courts to place effective restrictions on the publication of their own proceedings is severely limited...'

[57] Subsequently, in a paper entitled 'The Internet and the right to a fair trial' (2005) 29 Crim LJ 331 Spigelman CJ observed:

'The right to a fair trial is protected by numerous specific practices and rules that have developed over the course of centuries of practical experience involving adaptation to changing circumstances in accordance with the classic common law process. The internet is only the most recent technological challenge requiring a new course of pragmatic adaptation of our procedures.'

[58] Although, as Wood CJ at CL observed, the powers of the court to limit the availability of material published on the internet are minimal, some practices have been adopted which form part of the 'course of pragmatic adaptation' of the court's procedures to which Spigelman CJ referred. One is the practice of trial judges, at the commencement of any trial, to direct the jury that they are prohibited from undertaking any research, or making any enquiry, through the internet, in relation to any aspect of the trial, be it the identity of the accused, the identity of any person named in the course of the evidence, or a variety of other matters. In this regard Spigelman CJ said (at 334):

'Model instructions for the jury have long contained references to the jury not to conduct their own research. Many of them now contain express references to searching the internet as well as refraining from using other reference material such as dictionaries.'

[59] Needless to say, directions in these terms will be given to the jury at the commencement of the accused's trial. 

[60] Further, and in light of the submission as to the publication, on the internet, of the fact that the accused was on bail for offences of violence at the material time, it is also relevant to note that in K (supra) Wood CJ at CL observed (at 446) that there have been instances in the past in which the fact that a jury member had knowledge of past convictions, or of alleged criminal behaviour on the part of an accused person, had not been regarded as being sufficient to establish bias (see R v Booth; R v Box [1964] 1 QB 430; R v Hood [1968] 1 WLR 773; [1968] 2 All ER 56).

[61] Moreover, the Parliament has seen fit to enact s 68C of the Jury Act 1977 which renders it an offence for any juror to make an enquiry for the purpose of obtaining any information about the accused, or any matters relevant to the trial, except in the proper exercise of his or her functions. A reference to the provisions of 68C will necessarily be incorporated in the directions to which I have referred which will be given to the jury at the commencement of the accused's trial. Such directions will also include a direction concerning the obligation of all members of the jury to decide the case solely on the evidence. All of these directions will be repeated at appropriate stages in the course of the trial, as well as in the summing up.""

59Perhaps one of the clearest statements of support for the integrity of juries that have been assailed by a barrage of offensive material leading up to the trial is to be found in observations made by Mason CJ and Toohey J in R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 603:

""The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial. The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. As Toohey J. observed in Hinch (1987) 164 CLR, at p 74, in the past too little weight may have been given to the capacity of jurors to assess critically what they see and hear and their ability to reach their decisions by reference to the evidence before them. In Murphy v The Queen, we stated (16) [1989] HCA 28; (1989) 167 CLR 94, at p 99; see also Reg v Von Einem (1990) 55 SASR 199, at p 211:

'But it is misleading to think that, because a juror has
heard something of the circumstances giving rise to the
trial, the accused has lost the opportunity of an
indifferent jury. The matter was put this way by the
Ontario Court of Appeal in Reg v Hubbert (1975) 29 CCC (2d) 279, at p 291: 'In this era of rapid dissemination of news by the various media, it would be naive to think that in the case of a crime involving considerable notoriety, it would be possible to select 12 jurors who had not heard anything about the case. Prior information about a case, and even the holding of a tentative opinion about it, does not make partial a juror sworn to render a true verdict according to the evidence.''

To conclude otherwise is to underrate the integrity of the system of trial by jury and the effect on the jury of the instructions given by the trial judge.""

60Statements such as these are both authoritative and persuasive. 

61A further matter of relevance in this case appears to me to flow from the particular nature of the material to which the accused understandably takes objection. It will be apparent that much of what appears on the Internet is so extreme and so vile that on one available view it says more about those who are responsible for the material than it does about the accused. The system within which we operate places great store in the intelligence and the common sense of jurors and in the importance of their individual and collective wisdom. No proper direction to a jury could ever be expected to draw attention to the particular articles and opinions that have been disseminated about the accused. However, general directions to juries that they must disregard anything and everything that they might have read or heard could permissibly be cast in terms that unequivocally and unambiguously denounced such material as dangerous and inflammatory. In the circumstances of this particular case, there is considerable scope for the parties' assistance and input into the width and content of any such directions. That is important because too much emphasis upon the nature of the material could create a curiosity that the direction is intended to discourage. I consider that appropriate directions can be crafted to accommodate the accused's concerns, appealing directly to the jury's assumed common sense and experience of life.

62It will be apparent that I do not consider that it is in the interests of justice to make an order for a judge alone trial upon the basis of the potential for prejudice that exists as the result of pre-trial publicity or the potential for intra-trial access by jurors to such material. The interests of justice are not limited to alleviating the concerns of the accused. The interests of justice in the wider sense encompass, particularly in this case, the need to recognise the robustness of the system of trial by jury and its ability to withstand even the most irrational and suspect musings of faceless people intent on mischief. 

63The Crown contended that the interests of justice permitted me to examine whether or not the accused contributed to the nature and the extent of media coverage that developed. I need to make it clear that for my part I do not accept that the extent to which the accused may herself have contributed to the publicity and attention that her case has attracted is a relevant factor to be taken into account in assessing whether pre-trial publicity has diminished or eliminated the prospect of her receiving a fair trial. That argument was developed by the Crown in the following way.

64The accused initially claimed that the deceased had disappeared from her home. That became a news story all of its own and attracted considerable media attention. Much has been written about the accused's distraught and emotional presentation in front of television cameras when this story broke. Her public appeals for the return of her daughter were given wide coverage in electronic and print media. The accused's initial false report to the police resulted in an extensive police investigation that included the involvement of volunteer members of the public in search of the deceased. There was an understandable public backlash when this presentation was eventually found to be false and the accused has endured the product of public disaffirmation of her duplicity ever since.

65Whatever may be said about this conduct on the part of the accused, which the Crown wishes to characterise as false and misleading, it does not in my view reliably inform the question of whether or not it is in the interests of justice to proceed to a trial by judge alone. If it were otherwise the current inquiry would invite an examination of the truthfulness and reliability of everything that has been published or shown concerning the accused that she is fearful will poison any potential jury. That cannot have been intended. The preferable and only manageable approach is to treat all extra-curial publicity in the same way, whether true or false, and whatever may have been its cause or its source. It is inherent in the accused's application that she is harmed as much by lies as she is by truth. There is no benefit to be achieved in seeking out the difference. There is correspondingly no benefit to be achieved by ascribing blame for the publicity that is now a sad and irremediable fact of life in this case.

The potentially distressing nature of particular evidence

66In my opinion the matters raised by the accused can be easily dealt with in ways that do not produce an injustice to the accused and without the risk of an unfair trial. These days perhaps more than at any time in the past, members of the public are subjected to distressing images and depictions of death and injury to all manner of individuals in domestic settings and as the result of military conflicts. The Internet is, quite apart from the subject matter of this case, replete with troubling and disturbing material. Although it is important not to burden or overburden jurors with distressing material, including photographs of autopsies or mistreated corpses, especially of children, I think it is a mistake to underestimate the capacity of modern adults to deal with such images. It has to be borne in mind that courts have always had to take account of the line between substantial probative value and potential prejudicial effect. That includes the need to filter all but the most salient and relevant aspects of otherwise troubling evidence.

67As blunt as it may sound, the accused faces serious charges. The events that give rise to the charges involve a series of disturbing allegations. The accused has admitted that she caused the death of the deceased and that she was concerned in the disposal of her body. On one view that series of admissions may, and probably will, foreclose the need to examine material that might otherwise have been important. I specifically enquired of the Crown whether potentially disturbing material could be excluded altogether. His indication, which I do not criticise, was that it could not.

68There will be a need in this case for the jury panel in waiting to be warned that the case may involve disturbing material that ultimately selected jurors will inevitably have to examine. Once again, the traditional methods of offering potential jurors the opportunity to raise any particular concerns that they may have at an early stage, in aid of a request to be excused from duty, will be adopted in this case. There have been many disturbing murder trials in this jurisdiction and elsewhere but that is unfortunately the nature of the process. If an objection is ultimately to be taken to the tender of specific evidence at the trial, upon the basis that its potential effect upon the jury adverse to the interests of the accused is disproportionate to its value as evidence proving or tending to prove a fact in issue, it can be dealt with on a case by case basis at the time. 

69I note that in forming my views about this aspect of the application I have not been asked to view any of the material that arguably falls into the category about which the accused complains.

The SIDS material

70This material is no more or less than a sub-category of the wider set of publicised material. It is in a slightly different category to the extent that evidence concerning the death of the accused's son is specifically inadmissible. In my view any concerns about publicity attending the death of the accused's son, and the suggestion that his death was examined as potentially suspicious despite earlier conclusions that it was not, can and should where necessary be dealt with by an appropriate direction from me.

The potential for the application of objective community standards

71Present indications are that, having regard to the fact that the accused has pleaded guilty to manslaughter, the central issue at the trial will be whether or not the accused performed the act that killed the deceased with either an intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm or with a reckless indifference to human life. According to the Crown, it will be central to this determination that the act committed by the accused that caused the death was different to and more damaging than the act to which the Crown anticipates the accused will admit. There is likely to be competing medical evidence in support of these different versions.

72The Crown submits that if its evidence is to be considered properly by the tribunal of fact, it will involve an assessment of whether or not what the accused did evidences an intention or state of mind beyond that required for the crime of manslaughter. The tribunal of fact will necessarily be asked to consider the physical consequences for the deceased and to assess what was the relevant intent of the person who performed them. The Crown contends that such an exercise is very much an application of community standards and the ordinary experiences of life. The Crown submits, with particular reference to s 132(5) of the Act, that they are matters that are appropriate to be determined by a jury.

73In AK v The State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438, Heydon J considered that the question of whether or not an accused person had a particular intent was an example of an issue requiring for its determination the application of community standards. His Honour said this at [95]:

""...Thus Lord Devlin saw the jury as being for some purposes 'the best judicial instrument'. A clear illustration of this role of the jury is seen when the jury decides whether the facts it finds answer certain legal criteria. That phenomenon is recognised by s 118(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act, for the court may refuse to order trial by judge alone 'if it considers the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards such as an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness'. Other examples of factual issues requiring the application of 'objective community standards' include whether behaviour was 'threatening, abusive or insulting'; whether conduct was 'dishonest', a matter to be decided by the jury 'according to the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people'; whether an assault is 'indecent'; and whether an accused person had a particular intention.""

74The link between decisions concerning the existence or formation of a particular intent and the application of community standards was also discussed by Barr AJ in R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at [56] - [59] with a conclusion as follows:

""[59] I accept that the fact alone that community standards must be applied in the resolution of factual issues does not mandate trial by jury but, as subs (5) makes clear, it is a circumstance in which the jury may be considered to be the superior tribunal of fact.""

75For my part I find it difficult immediately to accept that cases concerned with the assessment of whether or not a particular individual had formed or retained a particular intent allegedly relating to the commission of some charged act necessarily or even arguably ""involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards"". The question, for example, of whether or not an act was committed with such force that it bespeaks or evinces a particular intention is undoubtedly a question of fact. The force of the suggestion that there is a corresponding and simultaneous requirement to apply some objective community standard in undertaking the assessment of that factual issue is not obvious to me. I note with some interest that the only citation provided by Heydon J for the proposition that ""whether an accused person had a particular intention"" was an example of a factual issue requiring the application of objective community standards was at note [86] to his Honour's judgment in these terms:

""[86] Buxton, 'Some Simple Thoughts on Intention', [1988] Criminal Law Review 484 at 495: '[R]ecourse to shared values and assumptions about the implications of actions and the circumstances in which those actions occur may be a safer guide to culpability than analytical deductions from a generalised verbal definition'.""

76In Belghar, McClellan CJ at CL expressed the view that the determination of intention in the particular circumstances of that case did not involve the application of community standards. Latham J referred to the competing views about it in R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661 at [58] as follows:

""[58] The Crown in King relied upon this aspect of Heydon J's judgment and the Crown relies upon it here. It is right to acknowledge that Justice Heydon's observation in this respect was not endorsed by any other member of that bench and that McClellan CJ at CL accepted that the issue of intention did not involve the application of community standards in the circumstances applying in Belghar. Like Bellew J, I am not persuaded that the issue of intention can never involve the application of objective community standards. I also note that the basis of the decision in Belghar was that the trial judge determined the application in the absence of appropriate evidence and without considering whether such prejudice as was found to exist could be neutralised by directions.""

77Having regard to the view I have otherwise formed, it is strictly unnecessary to decide the point. I accept cautiously that it could not be said that the issue of intention could never involve the application of objective community standards. It does not, however, appear to me that this is such a case. 

Conclusions

78In my opinion it is not in the interests of justice to make the order sought by the accused. Accordingly the application for a trial by judge order should be dismissed.

2706610,R v Sutcliffe & Ors [2013] NSWSC 715,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1Following trial, Sean Sutcliffe, Darren Hoskins and Darrin Moulds were found guilty of the murder of Jamie Lafoe and Michael Brown was found guilty of his manslaughter. Accordingly, they appear for sentence.

2The killing arose out of a joint criminal enterprise and therefore many facts and circumstances are of common applicability to all offenders. It is also necessary to recount some background which can provide an indication, if not an understanding, as to how some events came to take place.

3To varying degrees a number of people, including some of the offenders, were interested in motorcars. Over the night of 2-3 December 2010 a Holden Walkinshaw was stolen and stored at a property in Ambarvale. Such a vehicle, I gather, is embroidered with modifications so as to become an object of admiration by motor enthusiasts. Sutcliffe is said to possess a ""replica"", its modifications presumably having been applied independently of the Walkinshaw factory. On 16 January 2011 the stolen Walkinshaw was itself taken from its storage in Ambarvale.

4On the next day, three vehicles were set on fire in Ambarvale. One belonged to the mother of Jamie Lafoe and the other two belonged to an associate of his. The evidence does not demonstrate, nor was it an issue at trial, that at least Hoskins was in some way responsible for these burnings but I am satisfied that Jamie Lafoe came to believe that this was the case. It is not necessary to explore the basis for such belief. In a statement to police, Hoskins related that he heard him complain about his cars being burned. 

5Inspired by this belief, on 18 January Jamie Lafoe and two companions attended Sutcliffe's house at Ruse and spoke to his partner Ms Blinman. One of his enquiries concerned the location of Darren Hoskins. Ms Blinman called Sutcliffe and handed the phone to Jamie Lafoe who had identified himself to her as ""Sam"". After the conversation the three men left, one, as a result of seeing a child go to a house across the street, remarked ""they are probably calling the cops"". 

6The visit was followed by a number of telephone calls between individuals, after which Moulds arrived at Sutcliffe's house in his Commodore vehicle carrying his brother Jason, Eli Bestwick and the offender Brown as passengers. On the journey they had called at Brown's residence where he acquired a machete. Hoskins also arrived at Sutcliffe's house in his Pajero four-wheel drive carrying Mark Reid, Taulima Krauss and Richard Foster as passengers. 

7At the time of these arrivals, Jamie Lafoe and his companions had departed and, after some interchange with Ms Blinman, Moulds and Hoskins and their passengers also left. They did not quit the area and remained with their cars parked nearby.

8In the meantime Sutcliffe arrived home, not in Ms Blinman's car which he had taken to work but as a passenger of his friend Mark Watson. Ms Blinman informed ""Sam"" by telephone that Sutcliffe had come home. She told him to come down by himself and ""sort it out"". 

9Later, ""Sam"" (Jamie Lafoe) arrived. Ms Blinman said she saw a ""little gun"" tucked into the front of his pants and she noticed that his two companions had also arrived. The three men were on foot.

10Next, relevantly, the Commodore and the Pajero came from opposite directions to where she was with Sutcliffe. She described cars screeching and gunfire. Jamie Lafoe was discharging his weapon which was in fact a small .22 calibre pistol.

11Unsurprisingly, given the multiple sources, there are different descriptions of where the pistol appeared to have been aimed but I am satisfied that Jamie Lafoe was principally targeting the two vehicles which had arrived with eight presumably hostile (to him) occupants. At the time he was little more than arms length from those with whom he had been in conversation and they were unaffected by gunshot. However Moulds, who had arrived in his Commodore, was grazed by a projectile, although how this occurred and whether this was a consequence of deliberate aim, I cannot determine.

12The production of the pistol and its discharge were, on any view, provocative acts on the part of Jamie Lafoe. In so saying I am not suggesting that the requirements of s 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 could be fulfilled. Whether provocation operates to reduce the objective seriousness of the subsequently committed offence or whether it is simply a fact of mitigation upon which an offender is entitled to draw may be a matter of some legal debate but there is a clear legislative edict that a mitigating factor to be taken into account in determining the ""appropriate"" sentence was that the offender was provoked by the victim.

13It matters little whether there is some philosophical difference in approach and I find that the commission of provocative behaviour by Jamie Lafoe is a mitigating factor operating to reduce the sentence which otherwise would be assessed.

14I will apply that mitigation in respect of all four offenders.

15I return to the events of 18 January 2011. The occupants of the Commodore and the Pajero alighted. Brown struck Jamie Lafoe with his machete. I am satisfied that at that point, it was apparent to Brown that Jamie Lafoe was armed and had been discharging his weapon and that this blow by Brown was independent of his later participation in the chase which concluded in the fatality.

16At about the time that Brown struck the blow with the machete, Jamie Lafoe's companions fled. Although they had arrived on foot at the house, a Hyundai Excel vehicle was used to facilitate their flight but this was frustrated by Jason Moulds who commandeered Hoskin's Pajero and rammed the Excel, which was then abandoned. 

17Jamie Lafoe fled up the street from Sutcliffe's house on foot. He was pursued by the four offenders. I do not accept assertions that he was continuing to fire the pistol as he fled. By this time it was empty of live ammunition. Of course, the pursuers could not know this but I infer that Jamie Lafoe must have been aware that he was not any longer in a position to use it realistically to threaten anyone and hence I conclude that he was mainly bent on fleeing. In this he was unsuccessful and he either tripped or was tackled or both, whereupon he was set upon by the offenders.

18Among other injuries Jamie Lafoe suffered two stab wounds in the area of his lower back. The significant wound was very deep, measured at post mortem at over 16 cm, and it penetrated a major vein leading to blood loss and thereby to death.

19I interpolate that there was evidence that, as the deceased was fleeing, he was heard to call something along the lines of ""get the 9 mil"". I agree with counsel that this expression is likely to refer to a weapon. There is, however, no satisfactory evidence that Jamie Lafoe's companions were within earshot nor that such a weapon actually existed and was located in the vicinity. I do not accept assertions that a second weapon was actually seen by anyone. A possibility exists that the call may have been an attempt to bluff the pursuers and I recognise that Hoskins told police that he heard something to this effect when the victim was on the ground. The call amounts to an aspect of provocative behaviour but obviously of lesser consequence when compared to the earlier actual firing of the pistol.

20Before turning to the individual offenders, I should record some further matters of general application. I take into account statutory guideposts to sentence assessment. The prescribed maximum penalties for murder and manslaughter are imprisonment for life and for 25 years respectively. A standard non-parole period of 20 years has been declared for murder except in cases where the victim is in a prescribed category. The exceptions are not pertinent here.

21At the sentencing proceedings, a victim impact statement was read to the court by the deceased's mother on her own behalf and on behalf of the deceased's immediate and extended family. As required by statute I acknowledge receipt of that statement. It requires no comment from me to recognise the sense of anguish and loss that must be felt by her and the family but I record that I find no basis for making it appropriate that that statement's content be injected into assessment of the punishment of the offenders.

Sean Sutcliffe

22Sutcliffe was one of the offenders who participated in the physical attack on the deceased in the driveway of the premises in which his body was eventually located. I reject his assertions to police that he did not come within relevant proximity of the victim. The initial questions are what part did he play in the attack and what was his intention at the time.

23As earlier recounted, the fatal wound to Jamie Lafoe was a deep stab wound. I am satisfied, to the necessary standard, that it was Sutcliffe who inflicted it. Obviously one of the attackers did so and Jason Moulds gave evidence at trial of Sutcliffe's admission to that affect. I am conscious of criticism about the credit of that witness however the admission was not made privately, as it were, to Jason Moulds but to all those present when Sutcliffe returned down the street from the scene. There is now fortification for the truth of the content of the admission in the evidence of Brown, the only offender who elected to give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. His testimony included incorporating the truth of what he had told police in his interview where he had related seeing Sutcliffe performing the act of stabbing. Of course, the content of Brown's interview was not available evidence against Sutcliffe at trial but it was not sought to challenge him at the sentencing hearing. The absence of challenge is more surprising in the light of Sutcliffe's accusation that Brown was the perpetrator of the actual act of stabbing as recorded by the psychologist Mr Borenstein in his report of 16 May 2013. It was reported in the context of the somewhat curious inquiry by Mr Borenstein as to whether Sutcliffe felt that he had been adequately heard in relation to his version of events. It does not appear whether Mr Borenstein was informed that Sutcliffe had elected to remain mute at trial and gave no version of events. The version, in effect that he was always at a distance from the attack, which he gave to police was simply not credible. 

24The depth of the fatal wound is highly suggestive that it was made with an intent to kill however in the whole of the circumstances I am unable to be satisfied that Sutcliffe had that intention beyond reasonable doubt but I am satisfied that at the time of striking Sutcliffe certainly intended to cause grievous bodily harm.

25Motive is not an essential ingredient of the crime but the Crown argued that the offenders, including Sutcliffe, acted out of revenge or a desire to take the law into their own hands and punish Jamie Lafoe. There is much force in the argument and particularly in the absence of any credible contradiction I find this to have been the case. In particular, I am not satisfied of a probability that Sutcliffe attacked the victim for the purpose of containing any perceived threat to himself, his family or others which existed at the time of the attack. 

26Sutcliffe is now 40 years of age and was 37 at the time of the offence. His relationships and family responsibilities are detailed in Mr Borenstein's first report and need not be recited. His relationship with Ms Blinman and the children appears to have been stable and his care for them appears to have been suitably responsible. I have noted the difficulties reported in relation to an eight year old child. The stability has been achieved despite a matter of some concern in his prior record. For present purposes other matters in that record can be ignored but that one cannot.

27On 18 August 2000 Sutcliffe was sentenced in this Court to imprisonment for five years three months with a non-parole period of three years for manslaughter. The remarks on sentence of the presiding judge have been tendered. With others, the boot of his car was loaded with rocks and the group proceeded to an overbridge from which they cast the rocks onto traffic passing below on a four-lane highway. The targets were said to be trailers hauled by large prime movers, however two rocks crashed through the windscreen of a driver's cabin and at least one of them killed the driver by its impact. A finding by the sentencing judge was that Sutcliffe took a leading role and that, of four offenders, his culpability was the greatest. Two of those four offenders were aged 16 and 17 at the time and Sutcliffe was about 25. 

28Apart from the obvious seriousness constituting that offence, the credibility of Sutcliffe when he is reported to have made various assertions is not assisted by his explanation to Mr Borenstein that this offence arose out of ""hanging around with the wrong people"". That explanation is scarcely compatible with the finding of greatest culpability. Mr Borenstein recorded that he had read the remarks on sentence but made no comment on this apparent discrepancy. This prior conviction operates to inhibit the grant of leniency to which Sutcliffe might otherwise appeal. That is not to say however that he has no entitlement to some mitigatory weight being applied to sentence assessment. Submission by senior counsel acknowledged the provocative behaviour of the victim above described was the sole matter to which he could make appeal. This concession is understood to be qualified by a submission about the onerousness of the circumstances of his custody.

29I note that Sutcliffe does not accept the verdict however that is not a matter which intrudes into sentence assessment. Recognising that the offence must attract a lengthy period of custody, it was submitted that the statutory proportion of potential parole should be extended but I am unpersuaded that special circumstances exist so as to trigger variation and the period of potential parole will be in any event ample for rehabilitative purposes.

30The circumstances of Sutcliffe's custody and associated events are set out in his and Ms Havryliv's affidavits of 24 May 2013. Therefore I do conclude that Sutcliffe is unusually burdened and likely to be so affected in future and an element of mitigation will be applied to assessment.

31I have already mentioned the statutory guideposts. Absent the matters of mitigation arising out of the provocation of the victim I would assess a head sentence of imprisonment for 24 years. Against that assessment there needs to be given account to the provocation emanating from the victim. In this instance that was no minor matter. Jamie Lafoe came armed with a lethal weapon, used it in a threatening fashion and enhanced the threats by discharging shots in and around the area in which persons were present. That provocation was, of course, no excuse for chasing him down with the intent of causing him grievous bodily harm, and in the event death, as he was fleeing from the scene. Nevertheless I have assessed that the high level of provocation in the circumstances of this case should be reflected by a mitigation of one third against what otherwise would be an appropriate head term of imprisonment for this crime. 



Darren Hoskins

32I accept the submission that the evidence does not establish that Hoskins was aware, as I have found, that Sutcliffe was armed with the knife which he used to inflict the fatal wound. Hoskins was, I find, a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to inflict grievous bodily harm by some means on the victim and he is liable for the murder which was committed accordingly.

33On his own version to police, Hoskins entered the fray with a baseball bat which, although he dropped it at one point, was retrieved and used, although he claimed that he may or may not have made contact. Certainly no major injury to the victim could be associated with a heavy blow by the bat but I reject the contention that Hoskins' purpose was to disarm Jamie Lafoe. As I have said his intention was to cause grievous bodily harm and punish him.

34It is not insignificant that Hoskins came to the scene after collecting passengers in circumstances where it was obvious that there was potential for trouble of some sort and the numbers of men would give an advantage in a physical sense to any confrontation. The departure after first arrival, the waiting nearby and the return are all indicative of Hoskins preparedness to become engaged in whatever trouble might erupt. Added to his knowledge of the additional four men in the Moulds vehicle, the Crown description that they were preparing for ambush was quite accurate. Hoskins was aged 36 at the time of the offence and is now aged 39. He is in poor health as a result of an injury to his back and deterioration of his spinal stability. Treatment in gaol was inadequate which led to a grant of bail the reasons for which were expressed in a lengthy judgment by the judge who made the order. I have no reason to think that the situation is likely to be markedly different in the future during Hoskins' incarceration. 

35Counsel has also pointed to his status in protective custody. These two aspects, health and protection, are likely to make his service of sentence more onerous than the usual and some allowance will be made in assessment.

36Hoskins' prior record contains some matters, the more concerning of which relate to bonds granted on two occasions for common assault. These assaults were obviously in connection with matters far removed from the present but they do show that he has on occasions resorted to violence.

37Material was tendered concerning his back condition and I have no need to comment beyond what I have already said. I also note the letter from an employer which is favourable to Hoskins. Finally I have read the psychologist's report. Much of the opinion therein lies outside what I would consider the expertise of a psychologist. The report does not record application of specific psychological tests and their results. A number of documents were listed as having been examined. I do not doubt the sincerity of the reporter but I can only conclude that her favourable predictions may or may not come to pass and I make no finding as to probability.

38To the date of the sentencing hearing Hoskins had been in custody for one year eight months and 20 days. He was on bail for a total of 229 days.

39A specific amelioration of sentence assessment was sought on account of the notion that strict conditions of bail amounted to a quasi-custody in the presentence period. Such a notion has been recognised by authority. Exactly what were the strict conditions leading to the result were not specified but I take them to be the conditions of daily reporting to police and curfew. It has been calculated, allowing for actual custody, the sentence would be dated to commence on 20 September 2011. I make a further allowance of 60 days, approximately a quarter of the time of bail, in response to this submission and will date the sentence from 4 July 2011. Application is made to vary the formula for division of head sentence from that specified in the applicable statute by reason of special circumstances. I accept that health can operate as such but I am unpersuaded to make a special circumstances finding in this instance.

40Hoskins was a participant in an enterprise which led to death and there is no need for me to stress the seriousness of the criminality involved. Taking into account and balancing the mitigating matters to which I have referred, with the exception of the issue of provocation by the victim I would assess an appropriate head sentence of 18 years imprisonment. In so doing I have of course, paid heed to the statutory guideposts above mentioned.

41I repeat that in this case there was provocative behaviour by the victim of no minor scale. I do not repeat what I have said when dealing with the issue concerning Sutcliffe save to reiterate that it was Jamie Lafoe that brought a firearm to the confrontation and discharged shot in the vicinity of people present.

42As I have said, the statute expressly provides that provocation by a victim is a matter to be given allowance and on the facts of this case I would assess that allowance as one third of the penalty otherwise assessed.

Darrin Moulds

43In his first interview with police Moulds said that he had hit the victim on the head with a crowbar although he prefaced the admission by asserting that ""all my mates came running up and they're started laying into him with weapons"" which was a seeming attempt to minimise his own involvement. Of course, no blow other than the stabbing was causative of the death.

44I consider that Moulds' statement on that occasion that he acted as he did in retaliation for the gun being fired was truthful and I find that this was the case. His state of mind at the time was confirmed in revealing text messages which he later sent from hospital on that night. These included statements that he hoped ""the other guy"" was dead and that ""he had it coming"". 

45I do not ignore that a bullet fired by Jamie Lafoe impacted Moulds who told police that they (that is attending personnel at Campbelltown Hospital) ""said the bullets just grazed my head. There was no fragment bullets or no bullets in my actual skull"". The impact must have happened as one of the discharges when the two cars arrived at Sutcliffe's premises. In answer to specific questions Moulds told police that the victim did not aim the firearm at him as he was running away nor did he do so when Moulds tackled him.

46On 9 February 2011 Moulds was reinterviewed by police as a consequence of his own request communicated through his mother. Although information was forthcoming on this occasion, to the extent that Moulds made self-serving statements either to the contrary of or embroidering what he had previously said, I do not regard the later statements as dependable. 

47I find that Moulds, inspired by a desire for revenge or retaliation for the discharge of the firearm by Jamie Lafoe, joined in chasing him down as he fled and then participated in the attack on him with the intention of causing him grievous bodily harm. I accept the evidence does not show he had advance knowledge of Sutcliffe's possession of a knife but it is obvious particularly from the statements in the text messages, including that he hoped that ""the other guy"" was dead, that he was aware that the attack had inflicted a high level of damage.

48Similar to the situation concerning Hoskins, Moulds came to the scene in circumstances where trouble of some sort was anticipated. The occupants of the two vehicles constituted eight men who were available, in the vernacular, to provide muscle if required. Again like Hoskins, when there was no one relevantly there on first arrival, he did not depart the area but stayed nearby and returned after being informed that Jamie Lafoe and his companions had come back.

49Moulds was aged 28 at the time of the offence and is now aged 30. He has a minor prior record which may be ignored for present purposes. Tests by a psychologist place Moulds in the mild to borderline range of functioning and this is consistent with his history of special education and diagnosed developmental disability.

50His conduct since being in custody, and I incorporate the material from Superintendent Benson, leads me to a finding that his prospects of rehabilitation are favourable. I note that he is presently kept in protection and I anticipate that this is likely to continue.

51A submission was made concerning a pre-trial offer to plead guilty to a lesser offence than the murder of which he stands convicted. I do not conclude that such offer was a demonstration of willingness to facilitate the course of justice and I infer that the offer was conditional upon acceptance of the plea to the lesser offence. As, in the events of trial, Moulds elected not to give evidence at all, an offer while he sought to negotiate conviction for a lesser offence, does not create an allowance for mitigation.

52A disturbing aspect of Moulds' situation is the callousness revealed in the text messages to which I have made earlier reference. Overall, an objective assessment of Moulds' culpability including striking the victim, non fatally, with an iron bar, would tend to make his culpability higher in scale than that of Hoskins but of course less than Sutcliffe who performed the stabbing.

53However, taken altogether I consider Moulds' favourable subjective factors exceed those available to Hoskins with a result that I would consider a similar head sentence.

54A submission was made seeking a finding of special circumstances but I am unpersuaded to make such a finding. The potential parole period will be ample to provide supervision and assistance for reintegration into the community.

55There remains the issue mitigation by reason of the provocative conduct by the victim which I have, in each case, dealt with separately, from other mitigatory factors where they existed. I do not repeat what I have already said about the major quality of that provocation. 

56Accordingly I would assess the head sentence of 18 years imprisonment to be reduced by one third on account of provocation by the victim. Calculation produces a term of 12 years and there remains a claim for allowance on account of assistance to authority. For obvious reasons, I do not publish detail of this. In any event, the information which I have is not elaborate but I note the assessment of accuracy and scale of assistance. Although I have no testimony as to intention, I also note what was said to officers in that regard. For past and anticipated future assistance I will reduce the term previously stated by two years.

Michael Brown

57Brown was found by the jury to be not guilty of the murder of Jamie Lafoe but guilty of manslaughter. The availability of that verdict was left on alternative bases of what I might shortly call excessive self defence or unlawful and dangerous act. After several days of deliberation the jury advised that they were unanimously agreed upon verdicts in respect of three accused but not the fourth. This advice was communicated just before a luncheon adjournment. A standard direction was given including the possibility of 11 of 12 jurors being in agreement. However, after the adjournment the jury advised that they were unanimous in respect of all accused and returned the verdicts which I have set out at the beginning of these remarks.

58Brown is considerably younger than all the other offenders. It would be less than candid of me not to record that I consider it highly likely that the verdict on the fourth accused related to Brown and was reached as a merciful verdict for this young offender. I raised this consideration with counsel and both the Crown Prosecutor and senior counsel appearing for Brown submitted that I should not make such a determination and they both invited me to approach sentence on the basis that Brown was responsible for an unlawful and dangerous act. The Crown Prosecutor recognised that on such basis, at the time of his participation Brown must have acted without an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. 

59I have concluded that I should find in accordance with the urging advanced by both counsel. Inevitably this will operate to reduce considerably the level of Brown's culpability even for the lesser offence. I have already recounted that the blow to the victim's leg struck by Brown preceded the joint attack on him as he fled. That striking by Brown was at a time when Jamie Lafoe was at least flourishing, if not in fact firing, the pistol.

60Brown was 20 years of age at the time of the offence and is now 23. I am told that there was what was described as an informal offer to plead guilty to manslaughter when the charge of murder was before the Local Court but nothing came of it.

61This offender's background is one of deprivation, the incidents of which cannot but cause sympathy for his plight. He is an Aboriginal person who was born when his mother was 17. He never met his father. A relationship between his mother and another man provided seven siblings. At one stage he was made a state ward and placed in the care of grandparents. He did not complete school and left without learning to read or write to any substantial degree. In custody he is seeking to rectify this. He is on protection and is likely to remain there.

62Brown is diagnosed as having mild intellectual disability. Despite his handicaps he has, since leaving school, been in fairly continuous employment mainly in labouring jobs. 

63He has been in a de facto relationship since a very young age and has a small daughter. His expressions of sorrow when interviewed soon after the event convey sincerity.

64His prior record is not lengthy and indeed, given his background deprivation and handicaps, it could be regarded as admirable although there is a disturbing entry of an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm about which I have no detail but I can observe that he kept the terms of a suspended sentence which was expired before the current offence was committed.

65As with the other offenders Brown is entitled to an allowance for the mitigating element arising out of the provocation by the victim. I will make a similar allowance of one third as against term of sentence otherwise assessed. 

66A critical matter in assessment of sentence for Brown is the absence of intent to cause grievous bodily harm for his offence of manslaughter. Nevertheless, Brown was a participant to a lesser degree than the others in an attack which resulted in the loss of human life. Absent the issue of provocation by the victim I would assess a head sentence of seven years six months. A submission was made that I should extend the potential parole element of the sentence because Brown would benefit from an extended period of supervision within the community. In his case, I consider that that is so, particularly in the context of his handicaps and disabilities. Therefore I make a finding of special circumstances which will be reflected in the ancillary orders accompanying the imposition of sentence.

2706612,R v Aaron Tran; R v Peter Tran; R v Hoang Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 136,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Fullerton J.

2FULLERTON J: On 19 October 2012 the respondents were sentenced by Walmsley DCJ for offences relating to the importation of a commercial quantity of 6.25 kilograms of pure heroin, contrary to s 307 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (""the Criminal Code""). In accordance with the schedule contained in s 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code, the commercial quantity of heroin is 1.5 kilograms. The estimated wholesale value of the heroin was $2.5 million with the street value estimated to be between $6.25 million and $7.21 million. 

3After applying a discount of 25 per cent for the early pleas of guilty the following sentences were imposed against a statutory maximum of life imprisonment:

(1)For the offence of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawful imported border controlled drug, namely heroin, the first respondent, Aaron Tran was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 6 months and to be released after serving 2 years and 9 months pursuant to a recognisance release order in the amount of $100 to be of good behaviour for 1 year and 9 months. 

(2)For the offence of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin, the second respondent, Peter Tran was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. 

(3)For the offence of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin, the third respondent, Hoang Nguyen was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months. 

4Each sentence was ordered to date from 28 February 2012, being the date the respondents were refused bail following their arrest. 

5The Crown appeals the sentences imposed on each of the respondents as manifestly inadequate pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 

6The Crown did not submit that his Honour failed to have appropriate regard to the principles applicable to sentencing for offences relating to the importation of drugs (as to which see R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R 106 per Johnson J at [70]-[72] with whom Macfarlan JA and RA Hulme J agreed). Neither did the Crown submit that his Honour had made any factual errors, whether in respect of the roles attributed to the respondents or their descending order of seniority (with Nguyen appointed the most senior and Aaron Tran the most junior), or the weight his Honour afforded their subjective circumstances. Rather, the Crown submitted that each of the sentences is so markedly outside the range of an available sentence for the offending for which the individual respondent stood to be sentenced as to reveal latent error productive of a sentence that was in each case ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"". 

7It was also submitted by the Crown that the marked inadequacy of each of the three sentences was a likely consequence of Peter Tran being sentenced first, and to have derived from his Honour's acceptance of counsel's submission that Peter Tran should be treated as falling within the fourth category of offenders described by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1; 205 A Crim R 1 at [215] when, on a proper assessment of his role, he was within the third category of offenders described at [213]. The Crown submitted that categorising Peter Tran's offending in this way led to his Honour setting an unjustly low benchmark and, since he calibrated the other two sentences against that benchmark with the objective of achieving parity, the sentences for Aaron Tran and Nguyen were infected with error. 

8On the appeal, counsel for the Crown accepted that if the Court is not persuaded that the sentence imposed upon Peter Tran is manifestly inadequate (in the sense that it was unjustly or unreasonably low, whether because of a wrong application of principle or when compared with other sentences relied upon by the Crown) then the Crown appeal against the sentences imposed on his co-offenders should also fail. 

9I regard that concession as properly made given the way the Crown chose to argue the appeal. However, it does not necessarily follow that were the Crown to make good its challenge to the sentence imposed on Peter Tran that the appeal against the sentences imposed on Aaron Tran or Nguyen (or either of them) should succeed. Each of the respondents is entitled to have the Crown appeal against their sentence considered in accordance with the principled approach most recently affirmed in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462; 214 A Crim R 152, where the majority (French CJ, Crennan and Keifel JJ) at [1] restated that the primary purpose of Crown appeals is to ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"", with the Court retaining its residual discretion (qualified by s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001) to decline to intervene despite the sentence under consideration being found to be erroneously lenient. 

The evidence on sentence

10An agreed statement of facts was tendered in the joint sentencing hearing. Each of the respondents tendered a report from either a forensic psychiatrist or a forensic psychologist. Peter Tran called evidence from his family members. Various testimonials were also tendered. Of the respondents, only Aaron Tran gave evidence. 

11The offences related to the importation of heroin concealed in a consignment of four wooden crates airfreighted from Vietnam, the contents of which were declared to be ""statue, vase and bathroom accessories"". 

12On 22 February 2012 the consignment arrived in Australia. On 24 February 2012, following the detection by customs of drugs in three of the four crates, the consignment was the subject of a controlled delivery authority issued to the Australian Federal Police. 

13On 27 February 2012 the consignment was delivered to Peter Tran's home in Campsie where each of the three respondents removed the crates from the delivery truck and placed them in the carport. 

14The following day the crates were transported to Nguyen's house by Peter Tran and Aaron Tran on the instructions of an unidentified female. Peter Tran telephoned Nguyen and said, ""I think your mum wants us to clean it tonight"". When police executed a search warrant at Nguyen's home later that night the internal wooden partitioning used to conceal the heroin in the crates had been removed and the substituted inert powder had been separated from the partitions of wood. A heat-sealing device and two sets of electronic scales were found inside the premises. 

15Various conversations passing between each of the respondents were surreptitiously recorded by listening devices during the unpacking process where the weight of the drug, the composition of the inert substance and the anticipated financial benefit the respondents expected to receive from the importation was discussed.

16Following their arrest each of the respondents participated in an ERISP and made full admissions.

17Nguyen told police that he became involved in the importation when he was asked by a man who he met at a Kings Cross night club six months earlier, who he knew only as ""Anh"", if he wanted to make some easy money. Nguyen agreed that he thought the job would involve narcotics and that he was offered a large sum of money. (There was no evidence as to what amount of money was offered.) He took delivery of some mobile phones from the man and was told to get rid of them after he had used them. He arranged for the consignment from Vietnam to be delivered to Peter Tran (and sought and obtained his details for that purpose) because he did not want to use his own address. He asked Peter Tran to bring the consignment to his place as he had a van. He said that both Peter Tran and Aaron Tran assisted in unpacking the consignment. He said he removed one of the packages and, when white powder leaked out, he placed the package in a heat-sealed bag awaiting further instructions from the man at the nightclub. 

18In summary, Peter Tran admitted to receiving the consignment as consignee, conveying it to Nguyen's house and being present when it was opened. Other evidence established that he arranged for the payment of the freight and customs duties and that he spoke on two occasions to a person in Vietnam about the consignment. He kept in touch with Nguyen concerning the payment of freight and import duties. He signed the delivery docket as the nominated consignee when the crates were delivered. 

19Aaron Tran admitted to assisting Peter Tran to move the crates into Tran's garage on 27 February 2012 and to transport them to Nguyen's home the following day. He also admitted to assisting Tran and Nguyen to open the crates and remove the items but claimed that he then went into a different room. He said that when he saw the internal partitioning in the crates he suspected illegality.

The assessment of objective seriousness

20For the purposes of sentence, and without demur from the legal representatives for each of the respondents, his Honour accepted the Crown's submissions as to the roles each of them played in the importation. He considered the roles played by each of Peter Tran and Nguyen as essential and important, with Nguyen performing the major role and Peter Tran a lesser but significant role. He found that Aaron Tran had played the least important role of the three, a role of considerably less importance than the roles performed by his co-offenders and one that was not crucial to the success of the enterprise.

21In addition to the roles the respondents performed in the importation (and in Aaron Tran's case in attempting to obtain possession of the drugs), for the purposes of assessing the objective seriousness of the offending under s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), the sentencing judge also took into account the following features, affording them each relative weight in that exercise: 

(a) The quantity of the drug, described as ""relatively large""; 

(b) Each of the respondents was motivated by financial gain, with Nguyen telling police he had been offered a large sum of money and Peter Tran reporting to a psychologist that he expected to receive $10,000. (His Honour apparently rejected the account given by Aaron Tran to a psychiatrist that he was not offered any money for his part in the enterprise.) His Honour was not satisfied that anticipated returns revealed anything further about the relative roles of the respondents;

(c) The need for general and specific deterrence to sound in the imposition of significant sentences commensurate with the offences involving the importation of a commercial quantity of heroin and the personal circumstances of the respondents;

(d) The respondents' early pleas of guilty; and

(e) That neither of the respondents had a criminal history. Since there was no evidence that their clear earlier record had led to their recruitment for involvement in the enterprise, each was entitled to some leniency on account of their good character (see R v Leroy [1984] 2 NSWLR 441 at 446-7; Pang v R [1999] NSWCCA 4; 105 A Crim R 474; R v Klein [2001] NSWCCA 120; 121 A Crim R 90).

The subjective circumstances of the respondents in summary

Hoang Duy Nguyen

22The following subjective features were take into account in Nguyen's favour on sentence:
(a) His youth - 20 years of age at the time of offending;
(b) His remorse;
(c) His dependency on cocaine and cannabis at the time of the offending; and 
(d) His good prospects of rehabilitation.

23His Honour noted that Nguyen had not given evidence at the sentence hearing. For that reason he treated with caution statements Nguyen made to Tim Watson-Munro, psychologist, whose report was tendered, concerning his insight into the harmful effect of narcotics; his own pre-incarceration drug use; and his acceptance of culpability without the attribution of blame to others. Nevertheless his Honour accepted, with some hesitation, that Nguyen was remorseful and that his offending was out of character.

Peter Tran

24In the case of Peter Tran the following circumstances were taken into account as established by the evidence:
(a) His youth - 20 years of age at the time of offending;
(b) His cocaine use in the months leading up to the offending;
(c) His lack of knowledge of the actual quantity of heroin in the crates;
(d) His history of employment as a courier driver after leaving school at Year 10;
(e) His family support;
(f) His statement to the psychologist that he regretted his involvement and expressed shame at the impact on his family; and
(g) His good prospects of rehabilitation.

25His Honour noted that Peter Tran had not given evidence at the sentence hearing. He therefore also treated with caution statements he made to Bradley Jones, psychologist, whose report was tendered. His Honour was satisfied, however, that the history given to the psychologist was consistent with the evidence of Peter Tran's sister and brother-in-law. His Honour found these witnesses to be impressive and credible. 

Aaron Tran

26In Aaron Tran's case the sentencing judge took into account the following subjective features as established by the evidence:
(a) His youth - 20 years of age at the time of offending;
(b) His remorse;
(c) His good school and work record;
(d) His impressive references;
(e) His close family ties;
(f) His dependence on cocaine at the time of the offending in the context of the death of his father and the termination of a long-standing relationship with his girlfriend; and
g) His good prospects of rehabilitation given his level of education, his history of employment and his family support.

27His Honour noted that Aaron Tran gave evidence at the sentence hearing and that it was not suggested to him in cross-examination that his statements to Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, were untrue. These statements related to his being recruited by Peter Tran on the day the crates were taken to Nguyen's house, and that he had known Peter Tran from high school but at the time of the offence had only recently resumed a friendship with him through their shared use of cocaine. 

The sentences imposed (in the order in which they were imposed)

Peter Tran

28In sentencing Peter Tran his Honour said:
[30] I accept Mr Hanley's submission on [Peter Tran's] behalf that the quantity of drug ought be seen as a factor to take account of but not such as should determine the sentence. I am satisfied too that though he knew he was involved in a drug enterprise, he was not aware of the quantity of the drug he was involved with, as shown by some of the exclamations by him to fellow offenders as recorded by the police.

[31] I accept Mr Hanley's submission that the evidence shows his part in the matter was not to exercise any decision making functions. Rather he took instructions. I accept that his position was lower than that of Mr Nguyen. I have made findings about that, and I accept that he appeared to get instructions from Mr Nguyen to an extent. I do not forget that he had some contact with others in Vietnam, but that does not detract from that finding. I find also that the fact he appeared to have some trouble raising the $3,000 needed for freight and like expenses, does suggest he was not at a high level and that his part was somewhat lacking in sophistication. As he allowed his name to be used, and handed over a copy of his driving licence, I am satisfied he had a lower level of involvement. Mr Hanley conceded that his role was however important, and more so than that of Mr Aaron Tran.

[32] Mr Hanley submitted that though I should see De La Rosa as not binding, it is a decision which can be used as guidance and he drew my attention to McClellan CJ at CL's categories and suggested that I might put this in group four, with a plea of guilty and a drug range of one to thirty kilograms, with a lesser role and good antecedents. He put to me that an appropriate range for head sentences would be in the region of 6.25 to 8 years, with a non-parole period of 3 to 4½ years. He put to me that the non-parole period should be less than three quarters of the head sentence given that this is his first time in custody, given his youth, and given his health.

[33] In general terms I accept his submissions. [His Honour then referred to Peter Tran's subjective circumstances summarised at [24] of this judgment.]

[34] I propose to begin with a sentence of 10 years. I would deduct 25 per cent to arrive at 7 years and 6 months. By reason of what I regard as strong subjective matters, such as youth, rehabilitation prospects, and this being his first offence, I would propose a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.

Hoang Duy Nguyen

29In sentencing Nguyen, his Honour accepted that he had played an essential, important and trusted role in the importation by arranging for Peter Tran to provide his name and address as consignee; arranging for the drugs to be delivered to Peter Tran's address after the consignment cleared customs and thereafter arranging for them to be delivered to his premises for unpacking and for ultimate supply those who would disseminate the drugs.

30After considering a submission from Nguyen's counsel that his client was not in a managerial or decision-making position but answerable to others, and after considering and accepting the views of Simpson J in Tyler v R; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247; 173 A Crim R 458 at [75] that the higher the position a person holds in the hierarchy of participants in a drug importation the greater the distance they are able to maintain from physical contact with the drugs themselves (and that those in managerial roles are usually able to achieve that distance - an observation which his Honour considered had application to all three respondents), he found that Nguyen recruited Peter Tran to distance himself from potential exposure at the point of receipt of drugs and, for that reason alone, he had a role greater than Peter Tran, but that thereafter his role in unpacking the drugs was shared with the other two respondents. 

31In sentencing Nguyen, his Honour commenced with a sentence of 12 years which, after application of the discount for the plea of guilty, resulted in a head sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months.

Aaron Tran

32As to the role played by Aaron Tran (and after rejecting the Crown's characterisation of his role as important or crucial) his Honour said:
...It is clear ... that [Aaron Tran's] part was minor compared with that of the other two. His offending also was over a short period. No skill or knowledge was required of him. He has strong subjective factors. He has close family ties. 

The Crown conceded [that he] had come late into the picture, although she emphasised that his was still a significant role. That is a submission which, as I have noted, I do not accept entirely. 

33His Honour accepted Aaron Tran's evidence that he was shocked when the crates were opened and otherwise found him to be an impressive witness. 

34In sentencing Aaron Tran, his Honour commenced with a sentence of 6 years which, after application of the discount for the plea of guilty, resulted in a sentence of 4 years and 6 months and a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months.

Was the sentencing judge's reference to the fourth category of offenders identified in De La Rosa at [215] when sentencing Peter Tran productive of error?

35In a number of cases since De La Rosa was decided, this Court has held that limited assistance is to be gained by an applicant for leave to appeal against sentence endeavouring to position themselves in one or other of the categories of drug offender described by McClellan CJ at CL at respectively [207]-[215] in the case of commercial quantities of border controlled drugs and [216]-[223] for marketable quantities (see the cases referred to by Davies J in Thoung Nguyen v R [2012] 184 at [38]). What has been repeatedly emphasised in those cases is that the grouping of offenders into categories in De La Rosa by reference to common characteristics (so far as McClellan CJ at CL was able to identify them) was for general guidance and assistance to sentencing judges and not for use as a guideline judgment. 

36In R v Holland [2011] NSWCCA 65; 205 A Crim R 429 (a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of a sentence imposed for the importation of a commercial quantity of cocaine about which I will have something to say later in this judgment), McClellan CJ at CL at [3] said of his judgment in De la Rosa that it would be wrong to sentence an offender by attempting to discern the ""category"" into which they might fit and then imposing a sentence appropriate for an offence which happens to share the characteristics common to that category. In Holland Schmidt J at [52] (Buddin J agreeing) warned against a Crown appeal being mounted on the basis that the sentence under challenge fell outside the range applicable to offenders in one or other of the categories identified in De La Rosa. 

37In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge in the present case made express reference to De la Rosa and Holland in such a way as to leave no room for doubt that he was well appraised of the restricted use of the categories identified by McClellan CJ at CL in De La Rosa at [207]-[215] specific to the importation of commercial quantities of drugs in the imposition of sentence. (I note that both De La Rosa and Holland were referred to in the Crown's written submissions on sentence.) 

38It would appear from what his Honour said at [32] and [33] of his remarks on sentence (set out in [28] of this judgment) that counsel for Peter Tran urged his Honour to treat his client as within the fourth category of offenders identified in De La Rosa. In his oral submissions, however, counsel accepted that the point of distinction between the third and fourth categories in De La Rosa is not fixed. 

39Characteristics of an offender in the fourth category in De La Rosa at [217] of the judgment include performing a role variously described by McClellan CJ at CL as an instigator, overseer, collector and courier; where the quantity of drugs imported ranged from 1 kilogram to 30 kilograms; and where many offenders had good antecedents and no prior convictions. Head sentences ranged from 6 years 3 months through to 8 years, and non-parole periods from around 3 years to 4 years 6 months (with cases roughly split between those in which the offenders pleaded guilty and those in which they were convicted after trial). The third category of offender is described at [216] of the judgment as having a mid range role between that of principal and courier; where the pure quantity of the imported drug is below 7 kilograms and where head sentences ranged from 8 years to 15 years and non-parole periods between 4 years and 11 years (with a number of sentences involving pleas of guilty). The second category of offender described at [211] of the judgment played roles described as ""essential;"" and ""vital"" with high levels of responsibility but not principals, anticipating rewards in the realm of tens of thousands of dollars for their participation. Head sentences range from 18 years to 24 years and 6 months and non-parole periods between 10 and 16 years, most of which were imposed after a plea of guilty. The difference between the sentences in the third category (noticeably less than those in the second category) being explained by a combination of the pure quantity of the drug being less than 7 kilograms and discounts for assistance.

40The Crown submitted that the guidance given in De La Rosa would place Aaron Tran in the fourth group, Peter Tran in approximately the middle of the third group and Nguyen closer to the top of the third group, or in the second group. The Crown submitted that categorised in this way, each of the sentences were plainly inadequate. I have already referred to Schmidt J's criticism (at [52] in Holland) where error in the exercise of a judge's sentencing discretion, said to be productive of either an inadequate or an excessive sentence, is sought to be established on the basis that the sentence imposed fell outside the range identified as applying to the categories in De La Rosa, even in those cases where an offender might be seen as falling squarely within one category and not another. Her Honour went on to note at [61] in Holland that the difficulty the Crown was confronted with in that case in their reliance on the De La Rosa categories was the failure to identify any particular case within either the second or third categories that were relevantly comparable. The Crown in the present case did not undertake that exercise.

41Mr Hamill SC, who appeared for Peter Tran on the appeal but not on sentence, advanced the well founded submission that there is a broad spectrum of roles performed by offenders in both the third and fourth categories in De La Rosa, reflecting a continuum of criminal activity which does not stop at some notional point specific to the roles sentencing courts have come to use descriptively to differentiate between offenders in the one criminal enterprise. As the High Court emphasised in R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270 what is important in the assessment of the criminality of an offender is not the way an offender's role is described but what an offender actually did in effecting the importation or, in the case of an attempt to possess a border controlled drug, the steps taken by an offender in exercising control over the drug after it has been imported. 

42On a fair reading of the remarks on sentence as they relate to Peter Tran, I am not persuaded that when the sentencing judge indicated his acceptance of counsel's submissions, that he was intending to indicate anything more than that he accepted, in ""general terms"", that the role Peter Tran played in the enterprise (that is, providing his details as consignee at Nguyen's request, facilitating receipt of the crates and their delivery to Nguyen and ""recruiting Aaron Tran""), whilst important, was secondary to that of Nguyen who recruited him and that, when coupled with other features of the offending, including the amount of heroin involved, a role which should be given proper account in the assessment of objective seriousness under s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act (Cth). Moreover, to the extent that De La Rosa was utilised by his Honour in the way mandated by this Court in Holland and other cases (as I am satisfied it was), it would appear that Peter Tran received an effective sentence which was at the top of the wide range of sentences in the fourth category of offenders and at the bottom of an equally broad range in the third category. I am not persuaded that there is any discernible error in his Honour's approach to the sentencing of Peter Tran or that error infected the sentences of the other respondents in the way contended for by the Crown.

Are the sentences otherwise manifestly excessive?

43To the extent that one of the tasks confronting this Court when the Crown brings an appeal against sentence based on the ground of manifest inadequacy is to consider whether there is a relevant range of sentences for the particular type of offending or offence under challenge (as to which see R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66 at [38] per Basten JA), the Crown did not refer the Court to any case where a range of sentences was identified for offending of the kind encompassed by the offences for which the respondents were sentenced, or any case where an appropriate range of sentences was able to be clearly discerned such as might inform the question whether the sentences imposed on the respondents were demonstrably or markedly inadequate. 

44The Crown's written submissions did, however, include reference to a number of decisions of this Court which, it was submitted, demonstrate that the sentence imposed on Peter Tran was within the range of sentences applicable to a courier of a low level commercial or a marketable quantity of heroin in contrast to his offending which involved in excess of four times the commercial quantity and where the role he performed was well above that of a courier. 

45Of the cases relied upon by the Crown only three were referred to by McClellan CJ at CL in De la Rosa (namely Otto, Speer and Riddell), each of which was in the third category, with the exception of Speer which his Honour noted may have been placed within the fourth category had the offender pleaded guilty at an early stage. The balance of the cases were decided by this Court after De La Rosa. They concerned, almost exclusively, sentences imposed after a plea of guilty had been entered and where the offender was found to be a courier. Those cases are as follows:

In R v Otto [2005] NSWCCA 333; 157 A Crim R 525 the applicant pleaded guilty to importing 2.136 kilograms of cocaine contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). He acknowledged that he had been offered money to fly to Brazil, where he was fitted with a corset containing drugs and provided with a false passport before travelling to Australia, where he was apprehended. Hall J (with whom Hidden J agreed) found that the applicant was at a low level in the hierarchy well below that of a principal, but not a naïve courier who played no part at all in organising the importation. His sentence was reduced from 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years 6 months, to 10 years 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, reflecting, in part, an acceptance by the Court of his entitlement to a larger discount for the plea of guilty.

In Speer v R [2004] NSWCCA 118 the applicant was a courier who imported 2.54 kilograms of heroin. He had a gambling addiction and had agreed to import the drugs in order to clear his gambling debts. The sentencing judge found that he was unlikely to reoffend. After allowing a 10 per cent discount for a late plea, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 16 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. On appeal the sentence was reduced to 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. 

In R v Riddell [2009] NSWCCA 96; 194 A Crim R 524, which concerned the importation of 3.8 kilograms of cocaine, the respondent was a storeman who agreed to participate in the importation, having been threatened if he refused. Apart from a minor assault on his criminal record, he was a person of good character. After allowing a 25 per cent discount for an early plea, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years, with a non-parole period of 5 years. Following a successful Crown appeal, he was re-sentenced to an effective sentence of 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years. 

In Ng, Chin Swee v R [2010] NSWCCA 232 the Court dismissed an appeal against sentence for a courier of a commercial quantity of heroin on the grounds of manifest excess. The pure quantity of the heroin was 2.445 kilograms. The estimated street value of the heroin was between $293,400 and $1,711,500. The estimated wholesale value was between $857,500 and $960,400. After a discount for an early plea, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 11 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 7 years 3 months. 

In Youssef v R [2011] NSWCCA 104 a sentence of 7 years 8 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 8 months was held not to be manifestly excessive. The applicant in that case was a courier who pleaded guilty to importing 573.6 grams of heroin in his shoes from Thailand.

In Thuong Nguyen v R [2012] NSWCCA 184 the Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 2 months for the importation of a marketable quantity of heroin as manifestly excessive. He was a courier who imported a marketable quantity of 274.7 grams of pure heroin and who pleaded guilty in the Local Court. 


In Seah v R [2011] NSWCCA 269 the Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years imposed on a courier who pleaded guilty in the Local Court to importing a marketable quantity of 423.6 grams of heroin.

In Kuti v R [2012] NSWCCA 43 the Court dismissed an appeal against a sentence of 7 years 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months imposed on a courier who pleaded guilty in the Local Court to importing a marketable quantity of 452.6 grams of heroin.

46The Crown also relied upon the following cases as exemplifying the range of sentences for couriers or low level participants and the manifest inadequacy of the sentence imposed on Peter Tran: R v SC [2008] NSWCCA 29; Govindaraju v R [2011] NSWCCA 255; R v Mirzaee [2004] NSWCCA 315; Le v R [2006] NSWCCA 136; R v Bezan [2004] NSWCCA 342, 147 A Crim R 430.

47The Crown did not refer to Holland as bearing relevantly on the disposition of the Crown appeal. Whilst it is only one amongst a number of cases that might be used for comparative purposes, in my view it does provide some guidance. In that case the offender pleaded guilty in the NSW District Court to one count of aiding and abetting the importation of a commercial quantity of cocaine, namely 9.984kg, contrary to s 11.2 and s 307.1 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 6 years and 8 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years. His involvement was assessed by the sentencing judge as being integral to the operation involving a level of participation beyond that of a person who transports the drugs. He had supplied a warehouse for the receipt of the consignment, had inspected the forklift in which the consignment was concealed and informed a contact that he was mailing the key to the warehouse having acquitted himself of his role in the enterprise on receipt of the consignment. The sentencing judge allowed a combined reduction of 45 per cent for his plea and assistance to the authorities. He was aged 57 and a Canadian national who had taken up residence in Australia for the express purpose of facilitating the importation. He had no prior criminal record and had committed the offences to discharge his substantial indebtedness. A Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence was dismissed. The Court rejected the Crown's submission that the sentence failed to reflect the objective criminality in his offending having regard to the maximum penalty or that it resulted in an unjustified disparity with sentences imposed in comparable cases, in particular by reference to the categories in De La Rosa.

48On the appeal the Crown also referred the Court (albeit in passing) to a schedule of comparative cases that had been relied upon by the Crown on sentence. The schedule was limited to cases decided at first instance in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland involving importations of a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug. On close analysis, the schedule was wrong in some respects and lacked precision in others. After the Crown was invited to correct the errors in the schedule and ensure its accuracy, I have summarised the cases in a form which renders them sensible for comparative purposes and for inclusion in this judgment:

In R v Kreimerman (District Court of NSW, Wells DCJ, 13 December 2011, unreported) the offender pleaded not guilty to one count of attempt to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, namely 8.4 kilograms, contrary to s 11.1(1) and s 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code. After trial he was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months. He was assessed as being an intermediate in a large scale, sophisticated and well resourced importation, holding a position of trust and responsibility. The total weight of the cocaine under the control of a co-offender was 33 kilograms with a purity of 68.2 per cent. The offender was to extract from that amount almost 13 kilograms (with a pure weight of 8.4 kilograms). He showed considerable remorse. The sentencing judge was satisfied he was unlikely to reoffend. 

In R v Dede (District Court of NSW, Finnane DCJ, 17 February 2012, unreported) the offender pleaded not guilty to one count of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of methamphetamine, namely 2.973 kilograms, contrary to s 11.1(1) and s 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code and one charge of dealing in the proceeds of crime contrary to s 400.6(1) of the Criminal Code. On count 1 the offender was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years. On count 2 he was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment to be served concurrently with the drug offence. The offender was assessed as being an intermediate in the importation having collected the consignment from a co-offender (Pinero Asencio) who imported it into Australia intending to sell the drug for profit. When arrested he directed police to $40,000 in cash obtained from other drug dealing operations. 

In R v Pinero Asencio (District Court of NSW, Finnane DCJ, 17 February 2012, unreported) the offender pleaded not guilty to one count of attempt to import a commercial quantity of methamphetamine, namely 2.973 kilograms, contrary to s 11.1(1) and s 307.1(1) of the Criminal Code. The offender was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years. She was assessed as being an intermediate in the importation, being more than a mere courier and taking part in an operation that involved her going to South Africa to ensure safe transit of the drugs. She expected to obtain a significant reward. She was 38 years old, had no previous convictions, a poor upbringing and limited education. 

In R v Alasti-Faridani (District Court of NSW, McLoughlin DCJ, 10 February 2012, unreported) the offender pleaded guilty to one count of attempt to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, namely 3.173 kilograms, contrary to s 11.1(1) and s 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 7 years and 4 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 10 months. He was assessed as having a significant mid level organisational role, coordinating receipt of the consignment from customs by others, arranging for their payment, and communicating with Canadian contacts. He was 27 years old. A 25 per cent discount was applied for an early plea which, together with assistance given to police, resulted in a discount of 40 per cent. 

In R v Karan (District Court of NSW, McLoughlin DCJ, 12 October 2012, unreported) the offender (a co-offender with Alasti-Faridani) pleaded guilty to aid and abet an attempt to possess the same commercial quantity of cocaine. He was sentenced to 3 years and 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months. He was assessed as having a lesser organisational role than that of Alasti-Faridani in the importation. He had been recruited by Alasti-Faridani but subsequently recruited two other people to be named as consignees on the arrival of the consignment. He maintained communication with Alasti-Faridani throughout the operation and attended to the collection of the consignment. He was 27 years old. A 25 per cent discount was applied for the plea of guilty and his cooperation with the authorities. A Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence was upheld. Adamson J (with whom Johnson and Harrison JJ agreed) held that before application of the discount of 15 per cent for assistance (reduced from 25 per cent), the objective criminality of the offender was not adequately reflected in a sentence with a starting point any less than 7 years (R v Karan [2013] NSWCCA 53). He was re-sentenced to 6 years imprisonment with a 4 year non-parole period. (Her Honour also noted there was no challenge by the Crown to the sentence imposed on Alasti-Faridani.)

In R v Wong; R v Cheung (District Court of NSW, Williams DCJ, 20 April 2012, unreported) the offenders pleaded guilty to one count of importing a commercial quantity of methamphetamine, namely 3.121 kilograms, contrary to s 307.1(1) of the Criminal Code. Wong was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years. Cheung was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 8 months. Both were assessed as being couriers, customs officials at Sydney having detected the drugs concealed in hard-sided suitcases. Wong was a 24 year old male. Cheung was a 23 year old female. Cheung was said to have been naïve and vulnerable to the manipulation of others. Both offenders were found to be contrite and unlikely to reoffend.

In DPP (Vic) v Christos (County Court of Victoria, Taft J, 16 September 2011, unreported) the offender pleaded not guilty to one count of attempt to possess a commercial quantity of heroin, namely 7.016 kilograms, contrary to s 11.1(1) and s 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code which was embedded in carpets. He was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months. He was assessed as being an intermediate in the importation, having facilitated customs clearance and storage of the consignment. He was 58 years old and suffering from ill health. The sentencing judge was satisfied that he was unlikely to reoffend. 

In DPP (Vic) v Azizi (County Court of Victoria, Taft J, 16 September 2011, unreported) the offender (a co-offender with Christos) pleaded guilty to one count of attempt to possess the same commercial quantity of heroin, namely 7.016 kilograms, contrary to s 11.1(1) and s 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 8 years and 9 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months. The offender was assessed to occupy a position above that of Christos. He was recorded on telephone intercepts discussing the collection, payment and storage of the consignment with Christos and another co-offender and monitored the movement of the drug and was present when it was unpacked. He had discussions with unidentified people overseas about missing heroin. He was 33 years old. His plea attracted a discount of 1 year and 6 months [15 per cent]. Some degree of remorse was shown. 

In DPP (Vic) v Quy Hung Truong (County Court of Victoria, Montgomery J, 2 April 2012, unreported) the offender pleaded guilty to one count of importing a marketable quantity of heroin, namely 337.1 grams, one count of importing a commercial quantity of heroin, namely 4.788 kilograms and one count of attempt to possess a marketable quantity of methamphetamine, namely 7 grams, contrary to s 307.2(1), s 307.1(1) and s 11.1(1) and s 307.6(1) of the Criminal Code respectively. The offender was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment on count 1; 8 years imprisonment on count 2; and 12 months imprisonment on count 3. The effective overall sentence imposed was 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years. The offender was assessed as playing an integral or significant role in the importations. He and a co-accused arranged for a third party to import the heroin secreted within that person's legitimate consignment of seafood. The offender was 41 years old and pleaded guilty at the earliest reasonable opportunity. Some remorse was shown. He had good prospects of rehabilitation. 

In R v Firmin (Supreme Court of Queensland, Lyons J, 16 May 2012, unreported) the offender pleaded not guilty to one count of importing a commercial quantity of cocaine, namely 5.939 kilograms, contrary to s 11.1(1) and s 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. The offender was assessed as being an intermediate in the importation. He was arrested receiving the consignment in a controlled delivery. The offender was 39 years old and had no previous criminal history. Although he had played a significant role, there was no evidence of his wider involvement.

Consideration

49The principles applicable to a determination of a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentence are well settled. It bears restating, however, that before this Court intervenes and increases a sentence it is necessary to infer a failure to properly exercise the sentencing discretion reposing in the sentencing judge. This Court cannot merely substitute its opinion as to the appropriate sentence even where it would, or might, have imposed a heavier sentence (see Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321; 115 A Crim R 558 at [22]). 

50Having rejected the Crown submission that his Honour's approach to the sentence of Peter Tran was productive of error whether as a result of wrongly categorising his role referable to De La Rosa or for any other reason, and after giving close consideration to the range of sentences imposed in other cases as a measure or standard against which to review the sentences imposed in this case, I am compelled to the conclusion that the starting point of each of the sentences (respectively 12, 10 and 6 years), whilst lenient, perhaps even very lenient, was nonetheless within the range of sentences involving the importation of commercial quantities of border controlled drugs.

51In Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520; 204 A Crim R 434 (decided after De La Rosa) where at [48] the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) observed that consistency in sentencing ""is not demonstrated by, and does not require, numerical equivalence"". At [49] they went on to say that ""[t]he consistency that is sought is consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles"" and at [54] endorsed the use to be made of sentences that have been passed in other cases in accordance with the views of Simpson J in De La Rosa at [302]-[305] as follows:
[54] ... in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: ""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"". Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"" (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned"". 

52Simpson J also observed in De La Rosa at [305] that the sentencing discretion is individual and must be exercised by the individual judge in respect of the individual offender. The sentence his Honour imposed on each of the respondents would appear to reflect the considerable weight given to their age, character and antecedents bearing, in turn, upon their prospects of rehabilitation. It cannot, however, be said that he failed to afford the roles they played in the importation appropriate consideration in the sentencing exercise (none of which equated to a level of responsibility and organisational skill commensurate with a principal or even a delegate of a principal, and in Aaron Tran's case an involvement at the very lowest level) or that the weight of the heroin was not a feature of the offending adding to its objective seriousness and justifying the imposition of a significant sentence of imprisonment. 

53In short, I am not satisfied that the Crown has made good its challenge to the sentences imposed on any of the respondents as manifestly inadequate and, for that reason, the orders I propose are as follows: 

1. Crown appeal against sentence for Aaron Geoffrey Tran is dismissed.

2. Crown appeal against sentence for Peter Nguyen Tran is dismissed.

3. Crown appeal against sentence for Hoang Duy Nguyen is dismissed.

54ADAMSON J: I agree with Fullerton J.

2706613,R v Jacobson FITZSIMMONS [2013] NSWDC 169,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1I am sentencing a young man who became involved in a robbery on a train. The young man had become an adult merely weeks before the crime was committed. He has pleaded guilty and it is my job to sentence him or reach a conclusion about the appropriate sentence today. 

2His name is Jacobson Fitzsimmons. He was born on 23 April 1994 so he is still only 19. 

3What a judge has to do in sentencing is to say briefly what happened in the crime and then to say something about the offender and consider the arguments by the prosecution and the defence and then to reach a conclusion about the appropriate penalty.

4First I should say something about the crime. As it happened I sentenced one of the other persons involved in the offence last year so I will make reference to those remarks as well. Mr Fitzsimmons pleaded guilty to an offence known as robbery in company. That is an offence against s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to that offence. I formally convict Jacobson Fitzsimmons of that crime.

5The events happened at about 8.00pm on a Wednesday night, 6 June 2012. Mr Fitzsimmons went to Kogarah Railway Station with two other young men. One like himself had just turned 18 and the other was under 18 and therefore regarded at law as a child rather than an adult. The three got onto a train and found a man called Yi Zhang sitting on the train. He was near the guard's compartment. The three young men stood in the middle of the vestibule area. There were no other passengers around. One of the other young men, whose name was Raven Edwards and who was the other adult, sat down next to Mr Zhang. Mr Zhang was reading articles on his mobile phone. The articles were in Chinese. The other two sat nearby. 

6After some unsuccessful attempts at conversation Raven Edwards said, ""Give me your phone"". Mr Zhang said that he would not. Raven Edwards grabbed Mr Zhang's arm and tried to pull the phone away. Mr Zhang resisted so Raven Edwards stood up and punched him in the head at least twice. Mr Zhang tried to get away but Mr Edwards grabbed him. Mr Zhang fell onto the floor. Raven Edwards kicked him in the stomach. One of the others kicked him in the head and the neck. I heard evidence from Mr Zhang who was cross-examined by Mr Baxter of counsel who appeared for Mr Fitzsimmons. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Fitzsimmons was one of the ones kicking Mr Zhang in the head and the neck.

7One of them grabbed the phone and Mr Zhang's bag and they ran out of the train at Hurstville. Mr Fitzsimmons pushed through a ticket barrier without a ticket and he was stopped by the police. He was identified by some witnesses as one of the robbers. He was arrested and charged with this offence. 

8Mr Zhang sustained grazing to his face and neck. He sought compensation and I have ordered that.

9Mr Fitzsimmons comes before the court as a young man with no criminal record whatsoever. There is a pre-sentence report which has been prepared. It summarises his case as follows -

""Mr Fitzsimmon presented as an open and likeable young man who appears to have the ongoing support of his family. He has commenced an apprenticeship and is gainfully employed. Whilst he has a history of alcohol abuse and illicit drug use he has stated, and his mother has supported, that he is no longer using illicit drugs. To his credit he has undertaken the Positive Lifestyle Program and the facilitator has made positive comments about his engagement and participation."" 

The author of the pre-sentence report thought that he would be unlikely to need supervision. 

10Mr Baxter tendered some material on behalf of his client. There was a psychological assessment by the experienced forensic psychologist Anita Duffy. She noted that he expressed remorse and concern over his involvement in the offence. It noted that when he committed the offence he had lost his employment the day before and was angry and disappointed. He had been drinking and smoking cannabis. It noted that he had reduced his alcohol intake and is more cautious in his dealings with other people.

11Ms Duffy noted that research indicated ""that youth appear to benefit more from treatment than adults for offending behaviour."" She was of the view that ""community based sanctions...seem to be more effective for rehabilitating youth than more restrictive alternatives"". She thought an intensive correction order would be a suitable outcome. 

12There is a report from the chaplain about Mr Fitzsimmons' participation in the Positive Lifestyle Program for Youth conducted by the Salvation Army. The author, Major Susan Reese, concludes as follows:

""In summary, Jacobson has impressed me as a young man with significant potential and a genuine desire to live a good life. He has consistently shown regret that he has disappointed himself and his family and failed to provide a positive role model for his youngest brother. I have seen him demonstrate a genuine desire to change and a commendable level of insight. He has been open and honest in disclosing his feelings and discussing his actions. As a result he has shown significant growth and development over the time that we have been meeting, and I believe that this will continue as he matures, particularly given further learning opportunities and encouragement.""

13He has employment which includes an apprenticeship and is undergoing studies at TAFE. There is a reference from the head teacher of the metal fabrication and welding section of the Sydney Institute which is part of TAFE pointing out that Mr Fitzsimmons ""has been a consistent and reliable student, fore filling all the requirements for the units of competencies in stage one of his studies."" He has attended all classes. The author says that Mr Jacobson ""interacts extremely well with the teaching staff and peers alike"" and ""demonstrated all the very best qualities expected from a first year apprentice"". He has done voluntary work at the PCYC and there are references from people pointing out that his actions were out of character.

14Ms D M Weston who appeared for the prosecution pointed out that Mr Fitzsimmons' case fitted into the guideline judgment of R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R 149. There was limited planning and limited actual violence. He had no criminal record and the victim was vulnerable, sitting alone on a train. A small amount was taken and he had pleaded guilty. As Ms Weston said, the case fitted squarely into the guidelines set out by the Court of Criminal Appeal for judges who are sentencing robbers and the guideline was one of 4 - 5 years imprisonment.

15I asked why the case had taken so long to come on. Apparently it was not reached when first listed and then Mr Fitzsimmons had difficulty with his legal representation and then there were further adjournments and a pre-sentence report. 

16Mr Baxter assisted me with very comprehensive written submissions. Mr Baxter pointed out that there was no weapon involved in this case and that his client had played no part in the violence. His client had demonstrated some remorse expressed through the psychologist and the author of the pre-sentence report and the injuries and loss to the victim were not substantial. He had entered an early plea of guilty. Mr Baxter pointed out the references and positive steps taken by his client in undertaking the Salvation Army Positive Lifestyle Program. He pointed out how his client had kept his employment and was undertaking an apprenticeship and was making steps to put the incident behind him. He was doing voluntary work and finished the course. His case was that his client could avoid a sentence of full time custody. As a young man he would be vulnerable to other inmates and would be susceptible to their influence. 

17This is a case as Ms Weston says and Mr Baxter acknowledges, which in my opinion must be dealt with by a prison sentence. I reach that view because no other option is available and in my opinion the offence is too serious to be dealt with otherwise than by a prison sentence. However the question is how that prison sentence should be served.

18A factor which is an important part of this case is the sentence which I imposed on one of the co-offenders. I sentenced Mr Raven Edwards on 30 November last year. I imposed upon him a sentence of 2½ years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months. I regarded an appropriate overall sentence as being one of 4 years imprisonment but I reduced that to 3 years imprisonment because of his plea of guilty. I would undertake the same process in this case but I would adjust the figures so that the appropriate commencing sentence is one of 3½ years. I fix that sentence because I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this offender participated in the physical violence. I would reduce that sentence to 33 months because of his plea of guilty. Sorry that is wrong.

19In Mr Edwards' case I discounted his 4 year sentence to a 3 year sentence and then reduced it to a 2½ year sentence because of his age. I propose to undertake a similar process here. I propose to reduce Mr Fitzsimmons' sentence to one of 2½ years before taking into account the discount for the plea of guilty. I reduce it to 2½ years because there are three important distinguishing factors between Mr Edwards' case and Mr Fitzsimmons' case. They are all pointed out and relied upon by Mr Baxter. 

20The first is that in Mr Edwards' case he had a criminal record and it was a relevant criminal record. The second is that in Mr Edwards' case he was on conditional liberty at the time that he committed this offence. The third is that in sentencing Mr Edwards I took into account another offence under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. All of those factors were absent in Mr Fitzsimmons' case. Hence I would reduce his sentence to 2½ years imprisonment but reduce that further by 25 per cent because of his plea of guilty and fix an overall sentence of 22 months or 1 year and 10 months imprisonment.

21Because of his employment and his efforts to rehabilitate himself and the recommendations of Ms Duffy I propose to make an order for Mr Fitzsimmons to be assessed for suitability for an intensive correction order. Under s 69(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I refer Mr Fitzsimmons for assessment as to his suitability for intensive correction in the community. For that purpose Mr Fitzsimmons is to report to the office of the Probation and Parole Service at Hurstville on or before next Monday at 5.00pm, 17 June 2013. 

HIS HONOUR: Now in a moment I will re-list it but are there any other formal matters Mr Baxter, Ms Lockery which - so I have referred him for an assessment.
BAXTER: Just that bail conditions would remain the same.
HIS HONOUR: Yes. Ms Lockery bail the same?
LOCKERY: Yes your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Okay. 

22Bail is continued on the same conditions as presently fixed. 

HIS HONOUR: I think we have to allow 8 weeks don't we these days, is it 8 weeks?
LOCKERY: Yes your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: So we are presently Tuesday the 11th. I will have to list it on a day I am in Sydney civil. I have in mind Friday 9 August. Mr Baxter, Ms Lockery?
LOCKERY: Suitable to the Crown your Honour.
BAXTER: Your Honour it's unlikely I will be appearing at that time. 
HIS HONOUR: But somebody will be here?
BAXTER: They will and I understand that date is suitable.

23I list the matter for Friday 9 August 2013 at 10.00am. I continue bail until that date on the same conditions as presently fixed. I direct that a transcript of my remarks be taken out and made available to me for revision on or before Monday 5 August 2013. 

HIS HONOUR: I will explain this to Mr Fitzsimmons in a moment. Is there anything else, any other formal matters I need to attend to? I don't think so.
LOCKERY: No your Honour.
BAXTER: No your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Mr Fitzsimmons I have given you one of the options that Mr Baxter was arguing for. His best option was a community service order but your offence was too serious for that. The other young man, Mr Edwards, got a gaol sentence and I have given you a prison sentence as well. It is a 22 month prison sentence, 1 year and 10 months. But I am having you assessed for serving that in the community and Mr Baxter will explain to you and so will I if the assessment comes back positive what that means. It will be pretty restricted and restrictive on your freedom. That is to remind you of the trouble that you got into and to make it a form of punishment for you. But on the other hand it will enable you to carry on with your job, your apprenticeship and to keep the positive changes that you have made in your life. Keep those up. So it is a balance, and to keep you out of gaol which would be very bad for you. You had those 2 nights did you not, in gaol? Did you have 2 days?
OFFENDER: A night and a day.

HIS HONOUR: A night and a day, that is what I thought. And you had a cell mate who was friendly but it was still pretty scary was it not?
OFFENDER: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: Yes, that is what I thought. So you have got to turn up at Hurstville Probation and Parole this week but make sure you have done it by Monday at 5.00pm. Do you understand?
OFFENDER: I understand.
HIS HONOUR: And they will either assess you there or get things under way or send you to another office and then you will come back before me on 9 August and if the assessment is positive I will impose the sentence of 22 months and direct that you serve it by way of ICO which also involves voluntary work as well.
OFFENDER: Thank you your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Okay Mr Fitzsimmons. It looks as though you are on the right track which is a very good thing.

ADJOURNED TO FRIDAY 9 AUGUST 2013
