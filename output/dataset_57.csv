C A V J u d g m e n t
The plaintiff company, incorporated in 1976 but now in liquidation, was engaged in the business of making garments. It carried on its business and production activities at its factory in Lipo Building in Aljunied Road. Mr Lee Ah Kow, who is also known as James Lee, is described in the pleadings as the company's manager, although his exact position is the subject of some quibble. The directors of the company were shown in the companies register as Mr Lee Chong Ming, who is Lee Ah Kow's brother, and Nonya Yeep, who is Lee Ah Kow's wife. I shall for convenience refer to Mr Lee Ah Kow as Mr Lee, and I shall refer to his brother, when the occasion arises, by his full name.
On the evening of 4 December 1979, there was a fire in the company's factory in Lipo Building. There is no suggestion that the fire was caused by any deliberate act of anyone.
Broadly speaking, the entire production area, which covered the major part of the premises, was practically burned out. The store room was partially affected, and fairly complete rolls of textiles can be seen in photographs. The office was not affected by the fire, although like everywhere else it had been affected by water from the firemen's hoses.
There was in force a fire insurance policy issued by the defendants on 21 November 1979 whereby the company was insured against loss and damage by fire as follows:-
(a) Machinery and equipment: $300,000 
(b) Furniture fixtures and fittings: $80,000; 
(c) Stock in trade consisting of textiles and ready-made garments: $1,500,000. 
On 11 December, the company through its solicitors made a claim for the entire sum of $1.88 million. The solicitors' letter did not set out any details of the loss. On 25 December, the details of the loss, amounting to $2.5 million were set out in a claim form and sent to the defendants. They were as follows:
(a) Machinery (details given): $300,000 
(b) Office equipment: $100,000 
(c) Cloths: $1,300,000 
(d) Ready-made garments: $800,000
The company maintained their claim to the $1.88 million limit of the policy.
By letter dated 25 January 1980, the defendants repudiated liability on the ground that when applying for insurance, the company had given untrue answers to questions concerning other insurances in force and previous fire loss.
On 10 April 1980, the company commenced action in this suit, claiming the sum of $1,880,000. The defendants raised the following defences. Firstly, they repeat the ground stated in their letter of repudiation of 25 January 1980. They say that the proposal was declared to be the basis of the contract between the company and the defendants, and the truth and accuracy of the statements in the proposal was a condition precedent to the defendants' liability under the policy. Secondly, the defendants say that the company when applying for the insurance failed to disclose the unsatisfactory financial position of the company and the fact that Mr Lee was an undischarged bankrupt. They say that these were material facts, and failure to disclose them was a breach of the conditions of the policy entitling the defendants to avoid liability.
Thirdly, the defendants say the company was in breach of a condition of the policy against fraudulent claims in that it had supported its claim by producing falsely written account books and the claim was so exaggerated as to amount to a fraudulent claim.
Fourthly, the defendants say that the company failed to produce the purchases book and this was in breach of the documentary evidence warranty clause requiring them to produce documentary evidence of the value of stocks held.
I shall deal with the fraudulent claim defence first.
The fraudulent claim defence This defence revolves mainly around the quantity of stock in trade present on the premises, and the manner in which the company, through Mr Lee, went about trying to substantiate its claim in respect of the stock in trade, i.e. $1.3m for materials and $800,000 for finished garments.
The very day after the fire, Mr Leong, the adjuster for the defendants, asked Mr Lee for the account books of the company. On 7 December, some books and documents were received, including the creditors ledger and the debtors ledger. On 12 December, some more documents were received.
Mr Leong was particularly interested in the Purchases Book. The reason is not hard to understand. The book would show the amount of stock purchased by the company and would substantiate any claim made for loss of stock in trade, which forms the bulk of the coverage of the policy; for the company, the purchases book was also an important supporting document for the claim.
Mr Leong asked for the purchases book, among other documents, in a letter to the company on 7 December. He asked for it again in his letter to the company on 12 December. He knew there was such a book because the general ledger made references to entries in it. It was not until 3 January, that a book represented as the purchases book was received from the company's solicitors.
What was provided was in fact not the original purchase book. It was the original book re-written to include some 25 invoices for purported purchases from three suppliers, i.e. Joo Fatt Textiles Co, Kong Joo & Co, and Singatrend Pte Ltd. The new entries had been inserted in accordance with the dates of the supposed invoices, and there was nothing to distinguish the original entries and the new ones.
All the invoices were of various dates in 1979 up to the end of November. There were four new entries in respect of Joo Fatt totalling some $308,000, fifteen new entries in respect of Kong Joo totalling some $962,000 and four new entries in respect of Singatrend totalling some $145,000.
The re-written purchases book was provided to Mr Leong without any indication that it was a re-written work. The original purchases book was never produced to him or to the defendants. Neither was he or the defendants told of its existence. It did not surface until 12 September 1985 when it was handed over to the police for the purpose of criminal proceedings on a cheating charge against Mr Lee for making a false insurance claim on the defendants. I would add here that the criminal proceedings resulted in Mr Lee being acquitted of the charge.
Lee's reason for re-writing the book Mr Lee knew Ricky Loh, a clerk in a law firm. It was Ricky Loh who had persuaded Mr Lee to buy the insurance from the defendants. It was also Ricky Loh who advised Mr Lee after the fire that the purchases book should be re-written to include the invoices, as otherwise there would be difficulty in claiming from the defendants. Both Mr Lee and Ricky Loh also said that the original purchases book had been damaged by water and the entries were difficult to read.
Unfortunately for Mr Lee and the company, Mr Leong, an adjuster with 30 years of experience with insurance claims, noticed that there was something wrong with the purchases book that had been given to him. None of the entries had a folio number referring to other account books where a corresponding entry would normally be made. In the case of the invoices for purchases, there would normally be corresponding entries in the creditors ledger and against each entry there would be a folio number in the purchases book referring to the appropriate folio in the creditors ledger. There would normally be similar folio number references to the purchases book in the creditors ledger. This is in accordance with the familiar double entry practice of book-keeping.
Mr Leong also noticed that there were indeed entries in the creditors ledger in the respective accounts of the three firms. However, they were all against the date 3 December 1979, although the invoices, as we now know, were of different dates from March 1979 onwards. Mr Leong also noticed that there were no folio numbers referring to the relevant folios in the purchases book.
The ""special arrangements"" The reason given by Mr Lee for the omission to enter the invoices as and when they were received was that there were special arrangements with the suppliers in regard to the payment for the materials supplied.
Mr Lee said that from the early part of 1979, the company had become very busy, having to meet increasing orders. The company made an arrangement with these 3 suppliers as follows. The suppliers would supply fabric to the company. The company would use whatever it needed. At the end of the year, account would be taken on the basis of the amount of fabric actually used. The company would pay to account of the cost of the fabric supplied as and when it was able to do so. Until account was taken, Mr Lee thought that it was not necessary to post the invoices in the purchases books. He simply put them aside. He said that was why the invoices had not been included in the purchases book as and when they were received.
It is necessary to examine the arrangement Mr Lee referred to, and form a view about them. Here, it is necessary to point out some inconsistency in Mr Lee's evidence. At first, he said that the arrangement with all 3 suppliers was the same, as described above, but later he said that the arrangement with Singatrend was different from that with Joo Fatt and Kong Joo.
The Singatrend invoices In regard to Singatrend, its director Mr Yip gave evidence that the arrangement was for Singatrend to supply the company with fabric of the colour and specifications needed for making into garments for Singatrend's customers in Europe. The company was to make garments with the fabric supplied by Singatrend. The company would charge Singatrend for the garments at prices agreed. Singatrend would invoice the company for the fabric supplied, and the company would subsequently invoice Singatrend for the cost of the finished garments. If any fabric was not used, it could be returned, or retained by the company for fresh orders of garments from Singatrend. So the arrangement was basically for the two parties to invoice each other for goods supplied, raw material on the one hand and finished garments on the other.
Mr Yip said that the garments to be made from the fabric supplied under the four Singatrend invoices had in fact been completed the day before the fire, and he had arranged for a cargo container to be sent to the Lipo factory to collect them. The container was waiting to load, but the fire put an end to that. Singatrend eventually had the company wound up for failure to settle its debt to Singatrend.
Mr Yip struck me as an honest witness. I accept what he said. I think there is little question about the transactions evidenced in the four Singatrend invoices being arms' length.
The Joo Fatt and Kong Joo invoices The Joo Fatt and Kong Joo invoices, however, appear to raise serious questions. They were for much larger amounts, the two sets together accounting for some $1.27m.
According to Mr Lee, Joo Fatt and Kong Joo were willing to deal with the company on the special arrangement he mentioned because Mr Lee's brother-in-law from Hong Kong, who was a well-to-do entrepreneur, had met the proprietors of Joo Fatt and Kong Joo and had verbally given them a guarantee for what they supplied to the company. In Kong Joo's case, a guarantee of up to $500,000 was given by the brother-in-law.
The proprietor of Kong Joo, Mr Tan, was called. He was a most reluctant and unsatisfactory witness. It was only under some pressure that he came out in support of what Mr Lee had said about the special arrangement.
Mr Tan, then aged 29, was assisting his parents, who were the real owners of Kong Joo. The parents, incidentally, were not called. According to Mr Tan, he decided on his own to extend the credit to the company. It was his own judgment that the company was doing well, the factory was busy, and furthermore he had the verbal guarantee of Mr Lee's brother-in-law to the amount of $500,000. I have to form a view as to how much one could give to the evidence about the special arrangement.
The account between the company and Kong Joo shows that as of 1 March 1979, the company was indebted to Kong Joo to the tune of $124,000. It is not known how long this had been outstanding. Between then and the end of November, various sums totalling some $45,000 were paid, leaving some $79,000 still outstanding at the end of November. The payments were all in small amounts, a few thousand dollars each. There was, however, a payment, or rather an attempted payment, of $20,000 made on 13 September by a cheque drawn on the company's account. Apparently this was dishonoured, and on 1 October, a payment of that amount was made by a cheque drawn on Mr Lee Chong Ming's personal account. Mr O'Dea, an accountant called by the defence, said that a likely explanation for the money to be paid from Mr Lee Chong Ming direct to the creditor instead of into the company's bank account first and then for Kong Joo to be paid from the company's bank account, was to ensure that, in a situation where there were insufficient funds to meet all cheques issued, Kong Joo would be paid. This, according to him, indicated some pressure on the company to pay Kong Joo.
The account clearly suggests difficulty on the part of the company in paying Kong Joo.
Mr Tan said that the materials which he supplied to the company were bought from Kong Joo's suppliers on facilities extended by Kong Joo's bankers. Kong Joo no doubt had to pay interest to the bank, and to shoulder the cost of financing these large purchases.
I ask myself why any business concern would supply the company with nearly $1 million worth of materials on indefinite credit when the company had been so slow in paying for past supplies. Why would any business concern carry on its business in such a self-sacrificing manner? I cannot see anything in this arrangement for Kong Joo.
A major difficulty with Mr Tan's evidence is that apart from the invoices themselves, there is nothing in the documents to support what on the face of it is quite an incredible tale. In normal circumstances, one would give allowance to the unavailability of documents after so many years. However, in this case it is not so much the fact that supporting documents are not available, as the attitude of Mr Tan to the matter. When he was asked to show bank statements of the banks which he said had given Kong Joo credit facilities, he naturally enough said they were no longer available after so many years. But when he was pressed as to whether he would agree to ask the banks to supply copies now, he adamantly refused, and for no apparent reason broke down on the witness stand.
The invoice book from which these particular invoices were purportedly issued was not produced. The reason given by Mr Tan was that they had been damaged by rain, and, then on further probing by counsel, that they had been thrown away. Without the invoice book, of course, one avenue of testing the authenticity of the invoices in question was closed.
It is unfortunate that the boss of Joo Fatt, Mr Chiang has since died and is no longer available as a witness. But there is uncontroverted evidence which raises doubts about the assertion of Joo Fatt having supplied fabric to the amount of the 4 invoices. As of 1 March 1979, the company owed Joo Fatt nearly $45,000. There were some small transactions in the month of March, which brought the balance to the figure of $47,181.03. Without counting the four invoices in question in this suit, that figure remained right through to 24 November, when a sum of $5000 was paid. In other words, no substantial payment had been made by the company towards reduction of the amount outstanding for at least eight months. The details of the 4 invoices in question are as follows:

As in the case of Kong Joo, the question arises why Joo Fatt should supply goods worth over $300,000 to a company which had not made any substantial effort to reduce a relatively small outstanding balance for so long.
In regard to both the Joo Fatt and Kong Joo invoices, I am rather sceptical about the existence of any guarantee worth its name said to have been given by Mr Lee's brother-in-law. I accept that Mr Lee has a brother-in-law in Hong Kong, since he is very firm in his evidence about this and of course he should know. But apart from that, I find it rather strange that both Mr Tan and Mr Chiang as businessmen would place any reliance on the alleged guarantee given by Mr Lee's brother-in-law. Although they might not know that an oral guarantee is worth nothing in law, I am sure as lay businessmen using their native intelligence and common sense they would not put much weight on the verbal assurance of someone living in another country who only visited Singapore occasionally. It must also be noted that Kong Joo made no demands or requests for payment from the alleged guarantor when the company was not able to pay and he took out a writ against the company. There is also no evidence that Joo Fatt took any action to recover the debt either from the company or from the alleged guarantor.
I think the suggestion of a guarantee adds nothing to the company's case in relation to these invoices from Joo Fatt and Kong Joo. It only makes it all the more incredible. I would add that I do not, in the circumstances, attach much weight to the fact that Kong Joo took out a writ for the amount of the invoices, or the fact that they filed a proof for it with the Official Receiver when the company was wound up.
Other missing documents Now, to return to the company and Mr Lee, no proper stock book showing the movements of stock is available. Mr Lee said that such a stock book had been kept, but it was lost in the fire. There is therefore no direct evidence of the amount of the stock on the premises at the time of the fire. This is the company's fault, as by the documentary evidence warranty clause, it was obliged to keep a stock book and safeguard it against fire.
I must mention in this connection that all the account books for the two financial years commencing 1 March 1977 and 1988, according to Mr Lee, had been burnt in the fire. He said that unlike the 1979 books, they were not stored in the office but in the store room. This explanation should not be accepted unquestioningly. Firstly, it would appear that there was not much burning in the store room. Mr Leong said in his first report that the store was only partially affected by the fire. His photographs of the store room also show that the textiles stored there remained largely intact, except for damage by water from the fire fighting.
Secondly, I do not see any reason why being a young company with only a limited amount of account books there should be any need to move the previous years' account books from the fairly sizeable office (see Mr Leong's sketch plan) to a store room for raw materials at the far end of the premises from the office and presumably freely accessible to the company's production workers. I do not think that Mr Lee has told me the truth or the whole truth about the whereabouts of these previous years' account books or what happened to them. I think he chose to produce the 1979 account books as they contain entries which he thought would help his insurance claims. One thing these previous account books would have shown for present purposes was how well or how badly the company had managed its account with Joo Fatt and Kong Joo. As it is, all that we have are the opening balances at the beginning of the financial year, 1 March 1979, but not how long these debit balances had been outstanding. Such information would obviously be of help when considering the assertion that the two suppliers agreed to entrust the company with such large quantities of goods on such favourable terms. Not that the company's conduct of the accounts with these suppliers in 1979 alone is not enough to give one a fair picture.
The accountant's report In support of the company's claim, a report made by a firm of accountants Cheong Khee San & Co was produced.
This report was prepared only in October, 1992. It was based on the audited accounts of the company for the 3 financial years from 1.3.1976 to 28.2.1979, and the account books and documents produced in this suit.
The main object of the exercise was to estimate the amount of the stock as at the date of the fire. Mr Cheong came to a figure of $262,860 for raw materials and $1,357,399 for finished goods.
The value of this report is limited by the fact that not all the books and documents which were required were produced to the accountant. The report was made under what was known as SAP 14 rules. The witness agreed that if the data that were given to him were flawed the result would also be flawed. It was frankly not an audit.
Mr Cheong based his calculations on the amount of purchases which include the purchases subject of the disputed invoices. His estimates therefore stand or fall with those invoices.
Loss of machinery and equipment claim: the Hiap Foh fiasco
The company's creditors ledger shows a balance of $6393.55 due to Hiap Foh Industrial Sewing Machine Co. as of 30 November, 1979. Below the line showing the opening balance of that figure at 1 December, there is a clutch of seven entries of invoices with dates from 24 March to 3 December 1979, totalling $303,626.61. Then after the last invoice entry, there is an adjustment debiting Hiap Foh with the same figure of $303,626.61, thus reducing the outstanding amount due to Hiap Foh to the original $6,393.55.
Asked to explain what the seven invoices were for, Mr Lee said that they were for the supply of sewing machines. He said the machines were not necessarily bought in 1979; some of them might have been bought in 1977 or 1978. Asked for the reason for the adjustment, Mr Lee said that the machines had been paid for but Hiap Foh probably challenged that. The book-keeper must have dug out the old invoices and then made the entries. He said when Hiap Foh was convinced that the invoices had indeed been paid, the book-keeper then made the adjustment entry to reverse the entries so as to show that indeed the company only owed Hiap Foh the small amount of $6,393.55.
This version of how the entries came to be made was given in quite clear terms when Mr Lee was cross-examined on 6 November 1992. However, in re-examination on 19 April, 1993, Mr Lee said that the ""invoices"" were not actually invoices; they were what he called pro forma invoices, they were quotations for machines which Hiap Foh had given the company for approval. In fact, now said Mr Lee, the machines shown in these pro forma invoices had not been bought; the company had merely intended to buy them later in 1980.
The proprietor of Hiap Foh was called, but he could not substantiate even the pro forma invoices story.
The simple truth about these invoices came to light when Mr Leong, the defendants' adjuster, showed to the court that these invoices were none other than seven of the disputed Kong Joo invoices for fabric allegedly supplied by Kong Joo. They had nothing to do with sewing machines. They were simply entered in this part of the creditors ledger as a result of an obvious mistake on the part of whoever had been doing the entries. That was why they had to be adjusted. I have more to say later about Mr Lee's performance in the witness box in regard to this matter.
Fraudulent claims : The burden of proof The relevant condition of the policy on fraudulent claims is condition 13. It provides:
""13. If the claim be in any respect fraudulent or if any false declaration be made or used in support thereof, or if any fraudulent means or devices are used by the Insured or any one acting on his behalf to obtain any benefit under this Policy; ... all benefit under this Policy shall be forfeited.""
The burden is on the defendants to make good their defence that the company had made a fraudulent claim.
The standard of proof is a high one, but I do not think I have to apply the criminal law standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. I am content to rely on what Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal case of Bater v Bater < 1951 > P 35 said:
""A civil court, when considering a charge of fraud, will naturally require for itself a higher degree of probability than that which it would require when asking if negligence is established. It does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court, even when it is considering a charge of a criminal nature; but still it does require a degree of probability which is commensurate with the occasion""
This statement was referred to with approval in the subsequent Court of Appeal case of Hornal v Neuberger Products Ltd < 1957 > 1 Q B 247.
The High Court in this country has also approached the matter in the manner indicated by Lord Denning. See Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij N.V. v Koh Kim Guan < 1959 > 25 M L J 173 (Rose C J). See also Eastern Enterprises Ltd v Ong Choo Kim < 1969 > 1 M L J 236, and the very helpful analysis of the cases there by Winslow J.
Fraudulent claim: my findings
Applying the high standard of proof which should be applied, I am quite satisfied that for the reasons I have already indicated, the Joo Fatt and Kong Joo invoices are not what they purport to be. I am satisfied that neither Joo Fatt nor Kong Joo supplied the goods described in any of these invoices.
Mr Lee's conduct in relation to the production of the purchases book has all the manifestations of a man who knew he was doing something he ought not to do. He could easily have produced the original purchases book straightaway and explained why the invoices had not been entered. He did not do so; he concealed the existence of the book. He had it re-written to include the invoices in such a way as to show that they had been entered in their proper date sequence. He then presented the re-written book without saying a word about the original. The fact that he relied on the dubious advice of a solicitors' clerk does not make the act any the less his own.
I reject his explanation that the book had been damaged by water and the entries were hard to read. I have seen the original book. It is on the whole quite intact. The person who did the re-writing must have been able to read all the entries to produce a re-written book which, it is agreed, was a complete and accurate reproduction of the old (save for the additions of the invoices in question).
It was on any view a clumsy and futile way of going about it. The way the rewriting was done, with the conspicuous omission of the folio numbers, made it easy for any person with any experience of reading account books to see that there was something amiss, all the more so as the creditors ledger and debtors ledger which Mr Lee had given to Mr Leong just after the fire had all the entries of these invoices made, not in date sequence but all in one block at the end of the last page.
One is tempted to ask, but perhaps only to be meticulously fair to Mr Lee: if a claim is made in such a clumsy and transparently false manner, can it be fraudulent? Is it more the work of a fool than that of a knave? I think the circumstances of this case, particularly the surreptitiousness of Mr Lee's conduct, compel one to take the less charitable view.
I think I am also justified in taking into account Mr Lee's attempt to mislead the court in regard to the invoices attributed to Hiap Foh. A mistake is excusable, but in this instance it was more than a mistake. Mr Lee had, tried when giving evidence to rely on these entries in support of his claim for the loss of $300,000 worth of sewing machines and equipment. The figure of $303,626.61 fits almost exactly the amount of the insurance coverage for machinery and equipment and the amount of the company's claim in respect of that item. I think it was only when he found out later that the proprietor of Hiap Foh was not going to support him that he tried to contain the damage by saying something different, in re-examination.
I therefore reach the conclusion that the company as the insured had used fraudulent means in connection with their claim. I also reach the conclusion that the claim was so exaggerated as to amount on that ground a fraudulent claim. Although the company no doubt sustained losses, it is precluded from these facts from recovering any of the losses. This is the result at law, and it is also a result provided in condition 13 of the policy.
Fire expert's report Before I leave the subject, I ought to mention one matter.
On the very last day of the hearing, 26 April, 1993, the defence put Mr Dillon, a fire expert, on the witness stand. He had visited the premises earlier in the year, he was not able to recall when. He had prepared a report dated 9 April 1993, but because of his illness, it was only sent to the defendants' solicitors by courier on 22 April.
It was his opinion, based on an analysis of data from the adjusters' reports, that the company would not have had the amount of stock it claimed to have lost.
Mr Dillon has extensive experience in fire investigations and was an impressive witness. However, because the report was made available so late in the day, I have the distinct impression that the basis of his findings was not as well explored as one would have wished, despite the valiant attempts of the company's counsel.
I simply do not know why expert evidence could not have been obtained earlier. Springing an expert at the last moment is not what one might consider to be the best way of assisting the court. Although Mr Dillon's evidence, so far as it goes, seems to make sense, I am rather wary of accepting it all on face value.
Breach of basis of contract clause: amount of other insurances
The company signed a declaration at the foot of the proposal form warranting that the particulars of the proposal were true and that the proposal should be the basis of the contract between the company and the defendants. In the proposal form, in answer to the question ""Are there any insurances on the same property in force with this or other insurance companies?"", the company had stated ""Yes. QBE $500,000"".
The answer had appeared in a proposal form dated 12 November 1979, but because of a mistake related to the description of the property insured, a revised form was prepared and signed by Mr Lee on 14 November.
The facts about other insurances are as follows. On either date when Mr Lee signed the form, there were in force two fire policies issued by QBE Insurance Ltd., one for $100,000 and another for $73,260, taken out in February and September 1979 respectively, both for a one-year term.
Previous to this, on 5 November, Mr Lee had signed two further proposals for insurance with QBE, one for a fire policy for the sum of $820,000 and another for a consequential loss policy for the sum of $860,000.
The answer of ""QBE $500,000"" did not square with any of the above figures, or any combination of them.
It is not disputed that the answer was filled in by the defendants' agent Mr Wan. Mr Lee explained that what he told Mr Wan the agent was that he was applying to increase the QBE policy by at least another $500,000; it would be between $500,000 and $1 million. He also gave evidence that the two policies which he had applied for on 5 November were not issued to him until 25 or 26 November, so until then he did not know whether the proposals would be approved or how much they would be approved for. It is not disputed that the then existing QBE fire policies and the proposed QBE fire policy all covered or would cover the same property as the policy being applied for from the defendants. It is also clear, without making too fine a point of it, that the consequential loss policy applied for would cover loss consequent on the destruction or damage by fire of largely the same property.
I find Mr Lee's explanations quite difficult to follow, having regard to the very clear terms of the question asked.
Mr Wan, the defendants' agent, told me in effect, and I see no reason not to believe him, that he had got a straight answer to a straight question, and he included it in the proposal form for Mr Lee to sign. Mr Lee admitted that he had read through the completed form, albeit quickly, before signing it.
It seems to be contended by the defendants that the company should have disclosed the two existing policies as well as the two proposed. Counsel did not however address the law on the subject. It seems to me, however, that the principle to be applied is that of strict compliance. Just as the proposed assured has to be exact in his answer to a question, he is not to be faulted if he gives an answer exactly according to the terms of the question asked. The learned authors of MacGillivray and Parkington on Insurance Law, 7th ed, at para. 725, citing authorities, say:
725. General rule. It has always been the law since Lord Mansfield's day that there must be strict and exact compliance with the obligation or statement which is warranted, so that, as he himself said in Pawson v. Watson, ""Nothing tantamount will do or answer the purpose.""
They also say at para. 727 : 727. Exact compliance sufficient. The rule of strict compliance demands only an exact performance of the warranty or condition, and the insurer is not permitted to say that it was in the power of the assured to do more to comply with the warranty than he did, if what he did was an exact compliance.
If I am right, the position is this. The company was not required by the terms of the question to refer to the two proposed policies. However, the company had to answer exactly the question that was put. It should have referred to the two existing fire policies with QBE. The answer that it in fact gave was not the true answer the company by the signed declaration warranted it to be. The defendants are therefore entitled to repudiate on this ground. See Allen v. Universal Automobile Ins. Co < 1933 > 45 Ll. l. R 55 and other cases cited in MacGillivray et al., loc. cit.
I do not have to consider whether, independently of the question posed in the proposal form, there was any duty to disclose the proposed insurances with QBE. In closing submission, counsel made references to condition 3 of the policy requiring notification of insurances subsequently effected on pain of forfeiture of all benefit under the policy. As counsel for the company pointed out, this was never pleaded. I do not see why, particularly in a matter involving such serious consequences, I should allow the defendants to raise the point in such a fashion.
Breach of basis of contract clause : Previous fire
In answer to the question ""Have you ever suffered loss by fire?"" the company had stated ""No"".
In April 1979 there had been a fire at the company's premises at North Bridge Road. It recovered some $20,000 on a fire policy issued by QBE. Mr Lee said that he did mention this to Mr Wan but Mr Wan told him that he was only interested in any previous fires at the Lipo factory. I do not think this is likely. Mr Lee had just days before signed the proposal for the $820,000 fire policy to QBE in which a similar question (though slightly differently worded) was asked and the answer filled in for him by the QBE agent was ""Yes, please refer to claim department"". He must have known that this referred to the North Bridge Road fire. When answering the question in the defendants' proposal form it is highly unlikely that he would have thought that the insurers were only interested in previous fires at the Lipo factory, rather than any previous fire experience of the company as a whole.
Mr Wan said that he simply asked Mr Lee whether the company had had a fire previously and Mr Lee said no. I accept Mr Wan's evidence.
The untrue answer given to the question entitles the defendants to repudiate for the same reasons which apply to the question about other insurances dealt with above.
Breach of the documentary evidence warranty The relevant part of the documentary evidence warranty endorsed on the policy reads as follows:
""It is warranted during the currency of this Policy and is a condition precedent to any liability of the Company hereunder:-
(a) That in the event of a claim for loss arising under this Policy it is warranted by the Assured that they will produce Documentary Evidence in English of the amount of value of the stocks held immediately prior to the happening of the loss.""
The defendants plead in their re-amended defence that the failure to produce the original purchases book when requested constitutes a breach of this warranty. There has been no answer to this plea. Although the matter was not fully argued as to the law, I am prepared to uphold the defendants' plea. When the warranty speaks of evidence, it must, I am sure, be implied that it is evidence that has come into existence in regular course or any secondary compilation based on such evidence. As I have found that the Joo Fatt and Kong Joo invoices are not genuine invoices, it follows that the re-written purchases book cannot constitute evidence contemplated by this warranty.
Material non-disclosures: Lee's bankruptcy It is of course no crime to be a bankrupt. Plenty of perfectly honest people end up in the bankruptcy courts. However, the fact that the person having management responsibilities of a company is an undischarged bankrupt is something which an insurer is entitled to be told, so that they can assess the moral hazard involved and their risk under any insurance proposed. Although there has been a great deal of argument about the exact position of Mr Lee in the company, it seems clear that he held at least some management responsibility. He was also in charge of all insurance matters for the company. The company's reply to defence in fact describes him as the manager of the company. In evidence, Mr Lee sometimes described himself as the manager of the company and sometimes he insisted that he was only the manager of the Lipo factory.
I am of the view that the failure to disclose the fact of Mr Lee's status as an undischarged bankrupt was a material non-disclosure entitling the insurers to avoid.
As for the financial position of the company, I do not think it was such that it was incumbent on the company to disclose it. True it is that the company's financial position was not very healthy, being a young company, but it did manage to carry on as a going concern. It is nothing like the position of the assured in, for instance, Teh Say Cheng v North British Mercantile Ltd < 1921 > F M S L R 248, where there was an unsatisfied judgment..
Conclusion I therefore dismiss the company's claim with costs. I order that the amounts deposited as security for costs be released to the defendants' solicitors to be held to account of the defendants' costs.",1993-05-05 00:00:00,SG High Court
