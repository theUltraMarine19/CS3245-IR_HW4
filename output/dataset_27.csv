The appellant was tried in the district court on one charge of trafficking in 12.14g of heroin by having the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. He was found guilty and convicted. In addition, he pleaded guilty to one count of consumption of controlled drugs without authorisation and three counts of failure to attend for urine tests.
A confiscation order under the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 84A, 1993 Ed) (DTA) was made for $142,184.59. The terms of the confiscation order below were that the appellant had to pay a balance sum of $64,307.96 in addition to having all his realisable assets amounting to $77,876.63 forfeited, in default of which he would have to serve four years` imprisonment.
The appellant was then sentenced to 20 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, three years` imprisonment and two months` imprisonment for drug trafficking, unauthorised consumption of drugs and each of the offences of failing to attend for urine tests respectively. The first two sentences were ordered to run consecutively, the rest concurrently.
By the first appeal, the appellant appealed against his conviction for drug trafficking and the confiscation order. By his second appeal, he appealed against the sentences pronounced. However, the appeal against sentence was abandoned. There was no appeal against conviction for the other four offences.
It was agreed that on 7 August 1995 at about 5.30pm, the appellant was arrested by a group of CNB officers on the ground floor of Block 22 Old Airport Road. The appellant was searched and 18 sachets of heroin were seized from him. Eight sachets were in a sealed plastic bag, five were in a Marlboro cigarette packet, and another five were in another Marlboro cigarette packet. One of the sachets in the last group was open. Also seized from the appellant was an empty straw, a rolled paper pipe, a pager and a Rolex Oyster wrist watch. At CNB headquarters, $18,550 was seized from the appellant. It was admitted that all these items belonged to the appellant.
The flat which the appellant said he slept in was searched, but nothing was found. Neither was anything found at the appellant`s registered address, which was another flat. The appellant gave two urine samples, both of which tested positive for heroin consumption. There was no dispute that the appellant had a long history of drug abuse starting from 1975.
The appellant was sent for a pre-statement medical examination at Alexandra Hospital at around 10.45pm. At about 12.25am, he was sent for his post-statement medical examination. The appellant did not complain to the doctors who examined him that he was suffering from drug withdrawal. There was no allegation that the appellant had been assaulted. The appellant was never seen by any medical officer for any complaint of drug withdrawal during the entire period he was in Queenstown Remand Prison. It was common ground that he made no complaint of withdrawal.
The appellant`s defence was that the drugs were for his own consumption. The appellant was last released from DRC on 16 December 1992. He stopped going for his urine tests because he started to consume heroin again. Apart from a brief period of a month, he did not have any regular employment. According to him, he initially assisted a bookmaker friend of his at the Turf Club. He was paid $200 to $250 for a weekend of work if his friend lost. If his friend won, the appellant was paid $800 to $1000. Subsequently, in June 1993, the appellant became a bookmaker himself. He remained one until he was arrested.
The appellant testified that he suffered from withdrawal after he was brought back from the hospital. However, he did not inform the officer at the CID lock-up of his withdrawal, even though he was rolling about in pain. Nobody noticed him. He did not ask to see a doctor because a DRC inmate had once told him that if he complained he had withdrawal symptoms, he would be taken to Changi Prison Hospital. There he would not be given medication, but would be handcuffed to a bed. The appellant was transferred to Queenstown Remand Prison on 15 August 1995. He never complained that he suffered from drug withdrawal there either.
The appellant`s evidence-in-chief of his drug consumption was that he had already started consuming again in January 1993. At that time, one sachet would last three days. He stopped consuming heroin from June to November 1994. Instead, he switched to L4A tablets. After November 1994, he went back to heroin. A sachet would last him three days then. At the time of his arrest, he was consuming more than one sachet a day, but less than two.
During cross-examination, however, the appellant said that between December 1992 and February 1993, he consumed about one to two straws of heroin a day. He then absconded from drug supervision. From February to April 1994, he consumed about one sachet in two to three days. From April to June 1994, he consumed one sachet a day. He started consuming L4A from June to September. In September, he resumed consuming heroin, but also took L4A. At that time, he took one straw of heroin in about two days. After November, the appellant stopped taking L4A. His rate of heroin consumption increased to one sachet in two to three days. In January 1995, he was consuming a sachet in one to two days. Around April to June 1995, his rate of consumption had increased to one sachet a day. Since June 1995, he consumed more than one but less than two sachets a day.
Initially, the appellant bought his heroin one sachet at a time. He had various suppliers. The price was $120 a sachet. Around April 1995, he started buying five at a time at $100 a sachet. From June onwards, he purchased ten sachets each time. The price then was $70 a sachet. Sometimes, he bought 20 sachets when his supplier had to go to Malaysia. He kept the drugs on his person. His evidence was that he was able to support his habit from his bookmaking income, which he claimed to be about $6,000 a month.
The appellant testified that he had just bought 20 sachets at the Turf Club on 6 August 1995. His supplier had said that he was going to Malaysia. Before dinner that day, he had finished a sachet. He consumed the second sachet by about 3pm on 7 August. He then opened another sachet. According to him, that explained why he was found with 171/2 sachets when he was arrested.
Dr Lim Yun Chin (Dr Lim) was called as the defence`s expert witness. His evidence was that the assessment of the severity of withdrawal is subjective, depending on each doctor`s evaluation. There is no linear or direct correlation between severity of withdrawal and severity of addiction. There is a host of other variable factors, such as the personality of the addict, his age, physical health, tolerance and underlying motivation. A severe addict can at times exhibit mild withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can fluctuate at different times and it is not possible to predict an individual`s withdrawal symptoms.
It is also possible for an addict to downplay his withdrawal symptoms. There is a perception among addicts at DRCs that playing down withdrawal symptoms would be to their advantage. However, objective symptoms cannot be downplayed. The symptoms given by the appellant on 8 August 1995 are suggestive of mild withdrawal. There is no reported study of any addict in Singapore who could consume 1g of heroin a day without suffering from side effects. However, he had seen addicts in the United Kingdom injecting more than 1g a day without side effects.
Dr Leow Kee Fong (Dr Leow) gave evidence for the the prosecution in rebuttal. His evidence was that, in mild cases, symptoms start after eight to 12 hours, and would peak after 24 to 48 hours. These symptoms, if untreated, do not go beyond five days. Symptoms for severe cases also start after 8 to 12 hours, but peak after 24 to 72 hours. Left untreated, they can last up to two weeks. In moderate cases, they peak after 24 to 48 hours, but can last for seven to ten days.
In Dr Leow`s opinion, there is a direct correlation between the rate of consumption and withdrawal symptoms. Other factors such as health and personality could shift the grading either way. If two persons are compared, the amount of consumption and withdrawal are not the same. In the case of an individual, the more he consumes the worse his withdrawal is.
In his view, it is not possible for someone to consume one and a half sachets a day without suffering from severe withdrawal. It is unlikely that such a person would display only mild or moderate withdrawal symptoms. He has come across addicts taking 1g of heroin a day, but they suffered from serious effects. However, he could not exclude the possibility that there could be no side effect.
Dr Leow also testified that if a person consumes one straw of heroin in two days in September 1994, it would be exceptional for him to be able to increase his consumption to one sachet in two days in October 1994. Tolerance develops over a few months. Furthermore, once consumption is interrupted, tolerance goes down. He would not expect an addict taking L4A and heroin together to increase his consumption of heroin by a large amount when he gives up L4A. The level of increase would depend on the individual.
The district judge preferred Dr Leow`s evidence over that of Dr Lim`s. Dr Lim practised primarily as a psychiatrist and he mainly treated addicts who had post withdrawal behavioral problems. Dr Leow, on the other hand, had treated hundreds of drug addicts who were referred to him for medical examination for purposes of admission in DRC. He therefore had actual experience and knowledge of the linear and direct relationship between addiction and withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, Dr Lim`s opinion was based totally on what the appellant said.
The district judge thought that there appeared to be two lines of evidence in the defence`s case. Firstly, the accused was a severe addict with mild withdrawal symptoms. Alternatively, the appellant manifested severe withdrawal symptoms at the CID lock-up but chose to suffer in silence. However, Dr Leow was of the opinion that the appellant was not a severe addict because of his absence of severe withdrawal symptoms. While subjective symptoms can be suppressed, objective signs cannot. These objective signs were not present. It was unlikely that the lock-up personnel did not notice it if he had shown severe withdrawal.
"">He was of the view that there was no credible evidence of the appellant`s rate of consumption. The appellant was prepared to downplay his symptoms to avoid admission to DRC or being transferred to Changi Prison Hospital. It was unlikely that he was telling the truth about his consumption pattern at his trial for trafficking. Furthermore, by his own evidence, he had consumed two and a half sachets between noon on 6 August and 4pm on 7 August 1995. This differed from his evidence that he consumed one and a half sachets a day.
The district judge therefore concluded that the appellant was not a severe addict, but a mild one. It was probable that the open sachet was meant for consumption, but there was no point in apportionment because the weight would still be about 11.44g. The minimum sentence would still be 20 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. There was also no reliable evidence as to the appellant`s rate of consumption. He was satisfied that the presumption of trafficking had not been rebutted.
In the appeal, it was argued that the district judge erred in his understanding of the expert evidence. However, counsel`s argument before me was not that the district judge ought to have accepted Dr Lim`s opinion. Counsel made it clear that he no longer had any quarrel with the evidence given by Dr Leow. His argument was that, accepting Dr Leow`s argument, there was sufficient basis to make an apportionment. Counsel suggested that, accepting that the appellant was a mild addict, apportionment could be made on the basis that he consumed two straws of heroin a day. Fourteen days` supply would amount to about 2.45g, which would then reduce the trafficking charge to one of trafficking in an amount which was less than 10g. The DPP, on the other hand, submitted that there was no credible evidence upon which apportionment could be made.
In my view, there was some credible evidence in the present case. The appellant was no doubt a heroin addict. The prosecution did not dispute that he was anything less than a mild addict. A mild addict could consume one to two straws of heroin a day. The appellant`s evidence ranged from one straw in about two days to one and a half sachet a day, which was, of course, not credible. Despite this, it could credibly be said that his rate of consumption would be in the region of one to two straws a day.
However, I was of the view that any apportionment in this case would not have been material. This is because I could not accept the suggestion that the supply could be for a period of 14 days. Invariably, an accused would say that he had a larger amount of drugs on him than usual because he had just purchased it from his supplier, who inevitably was going `up country`. In the present case, the evidence of the appellant suggested that he had a regular source of supply. In my view, a generous estimation would have allowed apportionment on the basis that he consumed heroin at a rate of one to two straws a day and that, at most, about a week`s supply was meant for his own consumption. This would not have reduced the amount of heroin meant for trafficking to less than 10g.
Next, as a subsidiary argument, counsel urged that the district judge erred when he refused counsel`s application for the appellant`s long statement to be admitted. The long statement was admissible evidence to show consistency.
In 
 Kulwant v PP 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 10
; 
[1986] SLR 239
, it was held that the proper time to determine whether an application to direct the prosecution to produce witness`s statements would be during the trial when there will be material on which the court can decide on relevancy and the desirability of compelling production. In 
 Tay Kok Poh Ronnie v PP 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 185
, I held that it is wrong to withhold the accused`s own statements after he has given evidence, because such statements are admissible evidence. However, it was recognised that there could be the danger of an accused tailoring his evidence.
In this case, the defence required the long statement only for the purpose of showing consistency. The application was made when a prosecution witness, CNB Inspector Gopalakrishnan was being cross-examined. In my view, the district judge was perfectly entitled to refuse the application at this stage. As no fresh application was made again after the appellant had given evidence, the appellant had no cause for complaint. However, I must reiterate that I am here only dealing with the accused`s own statements. Different considerations may well apply to statements made by other witnesses. I can imagine situations where cross-examination may be hampered without sight of the witness`s statement.
In the circumstances, I did not think that there was any sufficient ground for me to disturb the appellant`s conviction for trafficking. I accordingly dismissed that part of the appeal.
In relation to the confiscation order, the district judge was of the view that apart from the appellant`s oral evidence that his income was from illegal bookmaking activities, there was no other evidence offered to support the appellant`s claim as to his sources of income. However, before coming to this conclusion, the district judge was mindful that, although bookmaking activities are illegal, it would nevertheless be a valid explanation to confiscation, if the evidence is accepted. Similarly, though the appellant`s evidence amounted merely to a bare denial, it would still be an answer if it was likely to be true. Unfortunately for the appellant, the district judge did not think that the appellant`s evidence was likely to be true.
Counsel argued that the district judge erred when he held that there was no other evidence offered to support the appellant`s claim apart from his oral evidence. Counsel appeared to be referring to the fact that the appellant won the quartet twice in 1993 and was paid some $16,000 and $7,000 respectively. The district judge commented that the appellant did not even produce the cheques for these. I do not think that this error was material. These sums had already been taken into account as legitimate income. There was no other evidence on the record. The appellant`s evidence was that he did not even keep written records of bets placed by punters with him. As such, I could not see what basis I had to disagree with the district judge on this matter.
Secondly, counsel did not agree with the quantum of the benefit. As regards the amount of benefits derived from trafficking, the statement pursuant to s 6 of the DTA showed that, in assessing the appellant`s concealed income, his drug consumption expenses were taken into account. In calculating this, the figures were based on the appellant`s claims in relation to his rate of consumption, ie one straw of heroin a day in January 1993, one sachet every three days from February 1993 till May 1994, an L4A tablet every day from June to October 1994, one straw of heroin a day from November to December 1994, and one sachet of heroin a day from January 1995 onwards.
Counsel`s argument was that these figures had already been rejected by the district judge when he convicted the appellant of the offence of trafficking. It would be incongruous and contradictory, therefore, that they should be relied on when computing the appellant`s hidden income. I agreed with counsel on this point. In fact, I had been troubled by it even though it was not mentioned in the petition of appeal.
It is noteworthy that s 6 of the DTA provides that, where a statement is tendered by the prosecution and the defendant accepts to any extent any allegation in the statement, the court 
 may 
, for the purpose of the assessment, treat his acceptance as conclusive of the matters to which it relates. The court is not obliged to do so. In my view, having found that these alleged rates of consumption were untrue on a balance of probabilities, the court should not rely on them when computing the appellant`s hidden income.
In the circumstances, accepting that the appellant was a mild addict, an acceptable figure (and on this, the burden of proof was on the prosecution) would be one straw of heroin a day. This meant that a fairer estimation of the appellant`s expenses for drug consumption for February to December 1993 should be $12 x 11 months x 30 days = $3,960 instead of $13,200. For January to May 1994, it should be $12 x 5 months x 30 days = $1,800 instead of $6,000. For 1995, the figure should be $12 x 218 days = $3,360 instead of $15,260. Hence, the amount of benefits derived from trafficking should not exceed $116,844.59, as opposed to $142,184.59.
There was, however, yet another difficulty that neither side appeared to be aware of. The prosecution`s case, as accepted by the district judge, was that the amount of benefits derived from trafficking was $142,184.59 and the realisable amount was $77,876.63. The district judge ordered that the realisable amount be recovered under s 7(3) of the DTA. He also ordered that a certificate under s 7(2) be issued stating that the amount to be recovered and the total amount confiscated was not to exceed $142,184.59. He then ordered a default sentence of four years` imprisonment for the balance of $64,307.96 under s 10(1)(b)(iii) of the DTA.
This order was made in April 1996. The district judge did not then have the benefit of my judgment in 
 PP v Hamid Sultan 
 
[1997] 1 SLR 230
. In that case, I held that in view of s 7(3), the amount recoverable under the confiscation order cannot be more than the realisable amount as defined in s 8 of the DTA.
In the present case, there was no issue of any gift having been made by the appellant. The realisable amount as stated by the prosecution was $77,876.63. The proper order should have been that the amount recoverable under the confiscation order was $77,876.63.
Furthermore, the default sentence under s 10 should not be for the balance of $64,307.96, but should be for the amount recoverable. There should be no default sentence for any balance sum, which the appellant obviously cannot pay. The balance amount is not recoverable, and the court cannot order him to pay any part of it unless an application under s 7(6) by the prosecution is successful. Since the court cannot order the appellant to pay the balance, it follows that it cannot order a default sentence for failure to pay it. Taking into consideration the fact that the amount recoverable was a larger sum than the balance which the district judge based his order for default sentence on, the appropriate default sentence was five years` imprisonment.
I therefore varied the order under the DTA. The order I made was that the amount of benefits derived from trafficking was $116,844.59, but the amount recoverable, which includes any amount confiscated, was $77,876.63. If the amount recoverable is not paid, the default sentence was five years` imprisonment, pro-rated for any sum actually paid or recovered.
For these reasons, I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against conviction. The appellant`s appeal against the confiscation order was allowed to the extent I have stated.
