King Respondent.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Automatic slot
machine—Amusement only provided—Results determined by skill of operator—No
element of chance or mixed elements of chance and skill—Whether service-vending
machine—Common gaming house—Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, sections 226,
229 and section 986, par. 4, as amended by 2 Geo. VI, 1938, c. 44, s. 46.

The appellant had in his premises an
automatic slot-machine for the amusement of the public known under the name of
""Evans Ten-Strike Miniature Bowling"". Section 986 (4)  of the Criminal
Code  enacts that, ""if any house, room or place is found fitted or provided
with * * * any automatic or slot machine used or intended to be used for any
purpose other than for vending merchandise or services, * * * there shall be an
irrebuttable presumption that such house, room or place is a common gaming
house"". The appellant was convicted of having kept a common gaming house,
and the appellate court affirmed the conviction, holding that, under that
section, all slot machines, including those vending amusement, were illegal.

Held, reversing
the judgment appealed from (Q.R. [1942] 1 KB. 1), that the machine found in the
appellant's premises was providing a harmless amusement to the operator and
that, for the purpose of determining this appeal, the word ""services""
should be construed as including ""amusement."" If a narrower
interpretation of the word ""services"" was given, it would then be a criminal act, for instance, to
keep in a hotel a music-recording slot machine, and this is not the letter nor
the spirit of the law. Therefore, the conviction of the appellant should be
quashed.

APPEAL, upon leave to appeal to this Court[1], from the judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[2], affirming the conviction of the appellant for the offence of
having illegally kept a common gaming house. By the judgment now reported, the
appeal was allowed, the conviction quashed and the slot machine seized was
ordered to be returned to the appellant.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now
reported.

J. Crankshaw K.C. for the appellant.

G. Fauteux K.C., A. Pagé and A.
Macnaughton for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Taschereau J.—The appellant was convicted by the Recorder of the city of
Montreal, of having on the 28th day of March, 1941, illegally kept a common
gaming house at number 2060 Bleury street, Montreal.

The judgment was upheld by the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, and the appellant on application to a
judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, under the provisions of section 1025  of
the Criminal Code , was granted leave to appeal to this Court, the judgment of
the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, being in conflict
with a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario (Rex v. Levine[3]).

The record reveals that the accused had in his
premises an automatic slot machine for the amusement of the public, known under
the name of ""Evans Ten-Strike Miniature Bowling "". It is put in
motion by placing a large five cent piece in a slide, which, under the pressure
of the operator,

[Page 86]

establishes an electrical current in the
machine. A ball is then released, and a mechanical player receives it coming
from a wooden chute and automatically holds it in its hand. The operator places
the player in the desired position, and then pushes a button which releases the
ball that strikes the pins at the other end of the alley. The number of pins
knocked down by the ball is registered after every two plays, and automatically
the pins are placed in front of the player who repeats the same operation five
times, playing with two balls each time. The machine adds the total number of
the pins knocked down during the game and indicates the final score.

The skill of the operator in aiming at the pins
is the determining factor of the success of the operation; and it is clear from
the evidence and the examination of the machine itself produced as an exhibit
in the case, that in the playing of the game there is no element of chance, or
mixed elements of chance and skill. A skilful operator will obtain far better
results.

The relevant sections of the Criminal Code  are
the following:—

226. A common gaming house is—

(a) a house, room or place kept by
any person for gain, to which persons resort to for the purpose of playing at
any game of chance, or at any mixed game of chance and skill.

***

229. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who keeps any disorderly house,
that is to say, any common bawdy-house, common gaming-house, or common
betting-house, as hereinbefore defined.

There can be no doubt that under these two
sections, the appellant operating or keeping in his premises this innocent
machine for the amusement of the public could not be convicted, (Roberts v.
The King[4]).
But the respondent relies on section 986 , paragraph 4  of the Criminal Code  as
amended in 1938, chap. 44, section 46, and which reads as follows:—

4. Slot machines.—In any prosecution under
section two hundred and twenty-nine any automatic or slot machine used or
intended to be used for any purpose other than for vending merchandise or
services shall, and any such machine used or intended to be used for vending
merchandise shall, if the result of one of any number of operations of it is,
as regards the operator, a matter of chance or uncertainty or if as a
consequence of any given number of successive operations it yields different
results to

[Page 87]

the operator or if on any operation it
discharges or emits any slug or token, other than merchandise, be deemed to be
a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance notwithstanding that the
result of some one or more or all of such operations may be known to the
operator in advance and if any house, room or place is found fitted or provided
with any such machine there shall be an irrebuttable presumption that such
house, room or place is a common gaming house.

It is in virtue of this subsection that the
appellant has been convicted.

The Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, had dealt with similar
cases since the amendment of 1938, and relied upon its former decisions to
dismiss the appeal in the present case.

In Rex v. Perlick[5], the court of appeal
had to consider a ""Target Skill"" which was alleged to be useful in
developing revolver shooting. The court reached the conclusion that under
section 986 (4)  of the Criminal Code , this apparatus not being used or intended
to be used for the vending either of merchandise or services was illegal, and
that its possession created an irrebuttable presumption that the place where
such a machine was kept was a common gaming house. It also held that the
shooting at a stationary target which affords no return other than amusement,
may not be called a ""service"" within the meaning of section 986 ,
paragraph 4 , Cr. C.

In that case, Mr. Justice Hall said:—

The effect of this new paragraph (986-4) is
that every automatic or slot machine, except those vending merchandise or
services, is presumed to be a gambling device.

In Rex v. Granda[6], the same court dealing
with a Pin Ball Slot Machine expressed identical views.

The Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, in Rex v. Collins[7],
had then already given its decision as to the legality or illegality of this
Pin Ball Slot Machine. Although it dismissed the appeal on the ground that this
machine was a game of chance yielding Collins a gain, it expressed views as to
the interpretation of section 986 , paragraph 4 , Cr. C, which were adopted by
the court of appeal of Quebec.

The result of the above pronouncements and of
the judgment of the court of appeal of Quebec, now before this Court, is that
section 986 , paragraph 4 , of the Criminal Code  declares all slot machines
vending amusements illegal,

[Page 88]

and that there is an irrebuttable presumption
that a room or place where such a machine is found is a common gaming house.

With the greatest respect, I cannot agree with
these judgments, and I believe that the opposite views adopted by the Court of
Appeal of Ontario in Rex v.
Levine[8]
should be upheld.

In the present case, we have to deal with a
machine that provides a harmless amusement to the operator, and I believe that
for the purpose of determining this case the word ""services"" includes
""amusement"". This word must not be given the narrow interpretation
that some courts have attempted to give to it, and its meaning must not be
limited to cover only certain necessaries of life like lavatories and
telephones. If such an interpretation were accepted, it would then be a
criminal act, for instance, to keep in a hotel or a restaurant a gramophone
reproducing music or vocal sounds after a five cent piece has been deposited in
a slot. I am satisfied that this is not the letter nor the spirit of the law.
This recording machine, and the one seized in the present case, do sell
""services"", in the sense that they furnish innocent recreation for
the benefit and advantage of the public.

I fully agree with the interpretation given by
the Chief Justice of Ontario in the Levine case[9]:—

The word ""service"" or
""services"" is properly used as meaning ""help"" or
""benefit"" or ""advantage"" conferred. I do not know why
amusement, which is all that is got by the operation of the machine in
question, may not properly be spoken of as a ""help"" or a
""benefit"" or an ""advantage"". In one way and another many
wise people spend a good deal of time and money in obtaining amusement, and to
a normal person it is almost one of the necessaries of life. In my opinion it
does no violence to the language of the statute in question to say that an
automatic machine that does nothing but amuse is a machine used, or intended to
be used, for vending services.

This machine selling services is excluded from
the application of the Act, and is not the kind of a machine which is the
object of the new enactment, and the possession of which creates the
""irrebuttable presumption"" which is found in the amendment.

It is necessary, however, to add, as the Chief Justice
of Ontario has pointed out, that certain machines vending merchandise and
services may be illegal if for instance

[Page 89]

they have gaming as their purpose. The vending
of merchandise or services does not authorize the use of a slot machine that for
other reasons would violate the dispositions of the Criminal Code . But this is
not the case here. The machine which furnishes only amusement and which has no
other purpose than vending services, does not come within the ban of the Act.

I am, therefore, of opinion that this appeal
should be allowed, the conviction quashed and that the machine seized should be
returned to the accused.

Appeal allowed, and conviction quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Appeal—Jurisdiction—Whether
dissenting judgments in a court of appeal disclosed a dissent on a question of
law within the meaning of section 1023  of the Criminal Code .

The respondent, a divisional registrar
appointed under regulations, enacted by order in council under powers conferred
by a Dominion Act of 1940, concerning National War Services, was found guilty
and convicted on two charges of having committed offences in contravention of
some provisions of these regulations. On an appeal by the respondent, the
appellate court, by a majority of three to two, quashed the verdict and the
conviction. The judgment of the majority of the Court declared the verdict to
be unreasonable for reasons resulting from inter alia an examination of
the relative values of the testimony adduced by the Grown and the testimony
given by the accused. The judgment did not rest upon any view of the majority
upon a question which was a question of law alone. The judgment of one of the
dissenting judges was simply to the effect that he was ""of the opinion
that the appeal should be dismissed"", while the other dissenting judge
held that there should be a new trial, without stating, either expressly or by
implication, that such conclusion was based upon an opinion that the majority
proceeded upon any error in point of law alone. On the appeal to this Court by
the Attorney-General for Quebec, the respondent moved to quash such appeal.

Held that no
jurisdiction lies in this Court to entertain the appeal: neither of the
judgments of the two dissenting judges of the appellate court discloses a
dissent on a question of law within the meaning of section 1023  of the Criminal
Code .

MOTION by the respondent to quash an appeal
to this Court by the Attorney-General of Quebec from a judment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, which had quashed a verdict of
guilty and the conviction of the respondent on charges of having committed
offences in contravention of regulations concerning National War Services.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now
reported.

Aimé Geoffrion K.C. for
the appellant.

G. Fauteux K.C. for the respondent.

[Page 81]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

The Chief
Justice—As is well known, appeals to this Court in
criminal cases are regulated by the Criminal Code . By section 1023 of the Code
it is enacted:—

Any person convicted of any indictable
offence whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten
hundred and thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the
affirmance of such conviction on any question of law on which there has been
dissent in the Court of Appeal.

""The Attorney-General of the province
may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of
appeal setting aside a conviction or dismissing an appeal against a judgment or
verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable offence on an appeal taken
under section ten hundred and thirteen on any question of law on which there
has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.

Turning to section 1013, that section provides:—

A person convicted on indictment may appeal
to the court of appeal against his conviction,

(a) on any ground of appeal which
involves a question of law alone,

(b) with
leave of the court of appeal, or upon the certificate of the trial court that
it is a fit case for appeal, on any ground of appeal which involves a question
of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact; and

(c) with leave of the court of
appeal, on any other ground which appears to the court of appeal to be a
sufficient ground of appeal.

The respondent, Pierre Décary, was tried upon a
charge preferred by the Attorney-General of the province of Quebec before the
Hon. Mr. Justice Lazure and a jury on the 10th of June, 1941. The charge
contained three counts, of which it is only necessary to quote the first and
third:—

(1) A Montréal, district de Montréal, du 1er du mois d'octobre 1940
au 23 du mois
d'avril 1941, Pierre Décary,
régistraire de division, nommé en vertu des Règlements de 1940 sur les Services Nationaux de Guerre, Jean
Tarte et Mike Maloley et autres
personnes inconnues ont comploté ensemble et les uns avec les autres pour
frauduleusement, en demandant, exigeant, obtenant, recevant et acceptant,
directement ou indirectement, des argents de personnes soumises aux Règlements
de 1940 sur les Services
Nationaux de Guerre ou d'autres pour elles, nuire à l'application et à la mise
en vigueur des dits règlements.

***

(3) A Montréal,
district de Montréal, du 1èr du mois d'octobre 1940, au 23 du mois d'avril,
Pierre Décary, régistraire de division, nommé en vertu des Règlements de 1940 sur les Services Nationaux de Guerre, a
provoqué et excité Jean Tarte et Mike Maloley à commettre et leur a conseillé et leur a fait commettre
l'offence suivante, savoir: de faire des offres, propositions, dons, prêts,
promesses, d'offrir et de donner des compensations, rémunérations, directement
et indirectement, à lui-même, fonctionnaire et personne chargée de
l'application des Règlements de 1940

[Page 82]

sur les Services Nationaux de Guerre, et ayant
à remplir des fonctions qui s'y rapportent, dans le but d'obtenir
frauduleusement pour des tiers, un ordre d'ajourner l'appel pour le service
militaire.

Contre la forme du Statut en tel cas fait et
pourvu, et contre la Paix de Notre Souverain Seigneur le Roi George Six, sa
Couronne et Sa Dignité.

The respondent was found guilty and convicted on
both of these two counts. He appealed from this conviction and the court of
appeal, by a majority of three to two, quashed the verdict and the conviction.

It is convenient, I think, to set forth the
grounds upon which the judgment of the majority of the court of appeal rests,
as they appear in the formal judgment:—

Attendu que l'appelant invoque à l'appui de son appel divers moyens basés
uniquement sur des questions de fait, d'autres sur des questions de fait et de
droit et aussi sur des questions de droit seulement;

Attendu que l'appelant soutient, en
particulier, que le verdict n'est pas raisonnable et n'est pas supporté par le
poids de la preuve; qu'à sa face même, ce verdict, comportant une
recommandation à la clémence de la Cour, est un verdict déraisonnable résultant
d'un compromis illégal entre les jurés qui avaient des doutes sur sa
culpabilité et ne lui en ont pas donné le bénéfice; que le seul témoignage
incriminant rendu contre lui ne pouvait, à raison de l'ensemble de la preuve et
plus particulièrement de son propre témoignage, servir die base à un verdict de
culpabilité, et qu'à raison des circonstances et de la façon dont ce seul
témoignage incriminant a été. donné, il y lieu de l'écarter entièrement et
qu'il ne peut servir de base raisonnable à un verdict de culpabilité;

Attendu que de toute la preuve rapportée par
la Couronne devant le jury, le seul témoignage pouvant incriminer l'appelant
est celui du témoin Jean-Louis Tarte dont les affirmations sont nettement,
catégoriquement et spécifiquement niées par l'appelant;

Attendu qu'il ressort du verdict, tel que
libellé, que le doute que devait nécessairement produire dans l'esprit des
membres du jury ce conflit de témoignages, n'a pu être complètement éliminé et
qu'il y a lieu, en pareil cas, pour la Cour, saisie du présent appel,
d'étudier, peser et apprécier la preuve et de lui donner sa véritable interprétation et son plein
effet;

Attendu que les circonstances qui ont précédé
et entouré le témoignage de Jean-Louis Tarte, telles qu'elles sont dévoilées
par le dossier donnent à ce témoignage un caractère particulier et qui en
affecte la force probante à un point tel, qu'en face des dénégations claires,
explicites et convaincantes de l'appelant, il serait déraisonnable d'asseoir un
verdict de culpabillité contre lui
sur l'un ou l'autre des deux chefs d'accusation qui lui sont reprochés;

As appears from the
enactments of section 1023 , quoted above, the Attorney-General's right of
appeal from a judgment of the court of appeal, setting aside the conviction of
an accused, is limited to some ground which raises a question of law on which
there has been a dissent in the court of appeal. It is well settled by the
decisions of this

[Page 83]

Court that such ground must raise a question of
law in the strict sense and that it is not a competent ground of appeal if it
raises only a mixed question of fact and law.

Counsel for the respondent moved to quash the
appeal of the Attorney-General from the judgment of the court of appeal
alleging that there was no dissent in the court of appeal upon any such
question of law and, consequently, that there is no competent ground of appeal
available to the Attorney-General.

After fully considering the able argument
presented by Mr. Fauteux, on behalf of the Attorney-General, our conclusion is
that for the reasons advanced by Mr. Geoffrion the Attorney-General has no
right of appeal in this case.

There were two judgments delivered by learned
justices of the court of appeal which were in disagreement with the conclusion
of the majority, and the point to be considered is whether or not either of
these judgments discloses a dissent on a question of law within the meaning of
section 1023  of the Criminal Code .

It is convenient, first of all, to notice that
the judgment of the majority of the Court does not proceed upon the ground that
there was no evidence in support of the accusations before the jury in the
sense that it was within the power of the trial judge, and, therefore, of
course, his duty, to direct a verdict of not guilty to be entered. The judgment
obviously proceeds under section 1013 (b), or (c), which gives a
right of appeal upon leave to the court of appeal on any ground which involves
a question of fact alone or a question of mixed law and fact, or on any other
ground which appears to the court of appeal to be a sufficient ground of
appeal. The judgment pronounces the verdict to be unreasonable for reasons
resulting from inter alia an examination of the relative values of the
testimony adduced by the Crown and the testimony given by the accused. It is
quite plain that the judgment does not rest upon any view of the majority upon
a question which is a question of law alone.

Turning now to the judgments of the minority,
Mr. Justice Hall simply says:—

I am of the opinion that this appeal should
be dismissed.

Plainly there is here no dissent upon any
question of law.

[Page 84]

Mr. Justice Walsh, in the
reasons delivered by him for his conclusion that there should be a new trial,
does not say, either expressly or by implication, that this conclusion is based
upon an opinion that the majority proceeds upon any error in point of law
alone.

It is plain, therefore, that the record
discloses no material enabling the Attorney-General to bring his appeal within
the conditions prescribed by the enactments of the Criminal Code , and the
appeal must, consequently, be quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Murder—Shooting
during attempted robbery—Four accused engaged in the robbery—Victim shot by one
of the four—Struggle between the latter and the victim—Jury instructed that
accused guilty of murder or nothing—Whether verdict of manslaughter should have
been left open to jury—Definition of murder—Ss. 252 (2), 259 (d) and 260 Cr. C.

The respondent H., with two companions, entered a shop kept by
the father of the victim for the purpose of robbery. The family of the victim
and the victim were sitting in a room, in the rear of the shop, separated by a
half door with curtains. The mother, hearing the store bell, entered the shop,
saw H. carrying a revolver and gave a warning to the family that a hold up was
in progress. H. fired a first shot through the wooden partition of the side of
the doorway and a second one through the curtains. The first of the shots
wounded the victim in the hand and the second in the arm. The victim
immediately came into the shop and grappled with H. in an effort to disarm him.
The accounts of the actual shooting by the mother and a brother of the victim
did not agree. The mother testified that, during the struggle, the victim was
attempting to take the pistol from H. "" but could not reach because he was
quite high"" and that she heard then only one shot, her son falling down;
while the brother stated that H. broke away from the victim, was leaving the
shop and, just as he was opening the door, turned and fired at the victim a
third shot which killed him; but the brother agreed with his mother that the
victim "" had H.'s wrist raising it up in the air "" during the
struggle. A witness for the Crown testified that H., on the evening of the date
of the crime, had made a statement to him ""that the gun accidentally went
off"". The trial judge charged the jury that H. was guilty of murder or of
nothing. All four respondents were convicted of murder, H. for having effected
the act of shooting and the three others as conspirators with H. and, as such,
responsible for the crime. A majority of the Court of Appeal ordered a new
trial, holding that the trial judge erred in not instructing the jury that they
could have returned a verdict of manslaughter, if they believed some of the
evidence that the revolver was accidentally discharged.

Held that the judgment appealed from (78 Can. Cr. C. 1)
should be affirmed. The trial judge properly instructed the jury that it was
their duty to find H. guilty of murder, if they accepted the evidence of the
brother of the victim; and that they could render a similar verdict, if they
accepted the mother's testimony, as they could properly infer that the shot
which occurred during the struggle,

[Page 518]

following at once the tow shots fired into the sitting room,
was intentionally fired by him in a state of mind evincing disregard of the
consequences of his shooting and with the knowledge that his conduct was
endangering the lives of the people whose premises he was invading. But the
trial judge did not deal with the third hypothesis, the possibility that they
might find the pistol was discharged by accident in the sense that it was not
discharged by any act of H. done with the intention of discharging it. The
trial judge ought to have told the jury that they might and ought to find a
verdict of manslaughter if they thought the pistol was not discharged by the
voluntary act of H. and that H. did not anticipate and ought not to have
anticipated that his conduct might bring about a struggle in which somebody's
death might be caused.—Also the trial judge proceeded rightly in instructing
the jury that, in the circumstances of the case, the law to be applied was to
be found in the Criminal Code  (S. 252 (2)  Cr. C.) Graves v. The King
(47 Can. S.C.R. 568) applied.

APPEAL by the Crown from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1], allowing an appeal by the four respondents in this
case, quashing their conviction for murder on a joint trial before Sidney Smith
J. and a jury and ordering a new trial.

The material facts of the case
and the questions at issue are stated in the above head—note and in the
judgment now reported.

R. L. Maitland K.C. and
Alfred Bull K.C. for the appellant.

A. Branca for the respondent
Hughes.

W. A. Schultz for the
respondent Petryk.

J. S. Burton for the
respondent Billamy.

T. F. Hurley for the
respondent Berrigan.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The respondents
were convicted of the murder of Yoshyuki Uno in Vancouver on the 16th of January, 1942. The act of shooting by which it is alleged the murder was effected
was, it is charged, the act of the respondent Hughes; the other respondents
were charged and found guilty as conspirators with Hughes and, as such,
responsible for the crime.

I shall deal first with the case
of Hughes. The evidence shows that on the date mentioned Hughes with two
companions entered the shop kept by the father of the victim

[Page 519]

at 305 West 4th Ave., Vancouver,
for the purpose of robbery. The family, his wife, the mother of the victim, a
daughter, the victim and another son, lived with him in the rear of the shop
which was separated from a sitting room, or living room, by what is called a
half door with curtains on the store side extending to the floor. There is a
bell which rings in the sitting room when the street door of the store opens.

On the occasion with which we are
concerned Mr. and Mrs. Uno were sitting in the sitting room with the deceased
son and the other son and daughter. The store bell having rung, the father left
the room for some reason and the mother entered the shop. She says Hughes was
carrying a revolver and she uttered some expression which gave a warning to the
family in the sitting room that a hold-up was in progress. They had formerly
gone through the same experience and this expression was understood. Mrs. Uno
says that Hughes went immediately toward the curtains of the door leading into
the sitting room and, as he approached, he fired a shot which passed through
the wooden partition at the side of the doorway. When he got to the curtains he
fired another shot through the curtains. The first of these shots wounded
Yoshyuki Uno in the hand and the second in the arm. Yoshyuki immediately came
into the store and grappled with Hughes in an effort to disarm him. The brother
and the mother were in the store at this time together and the brother agrees
with the mother that this struggle took place. Their accounts, however, of the
actual shooting of the victim do not agree. The brother says that Hughes broke
away from Yoshyuki and left the shop and, just as he was opening the door
turned and fired at Yoshyuki a third shot which took effect in his head and
killed him. The mother says that in the struggle Yoshyuki was attempting to
take the pistol from Hughes ""but could not reach because he was quite
high"". She adds:—

* * * Hughes was holding
gun, and my son grabbed his wrist.

Q. Does she mean that Hughes
was holding the gun in his hand?

A. Yes, and my son was doing
his best, and trying to bring it down, but he was quite weakened because he
sustained injury already.

She says that while they were
struggling she heard a shot and afterwards did not hear another, that after the

[Page 520]

shot her son fell down and Hughes
made off. She distinctly remembers one shot fired during the struggle but heard
no later shot. It ought to be observed perhaps that the brother's evidence,
while generally agreeing with his mother's statement that there was a struggle,
is to the effect that Yoshyuki "" had Hughes' wrist raising it up in the
air"". If the jury accepted the brother's account of the shooting they had
before them, of course, a plain case of murder. The controversy turns entirely
upon the alternative hypothesis that the third shot occurred during the
struggle, as the mother says.

The majority of the Court of
Appeal have held that it was open to the jury, if they took a certain view of
the evidence, to find that the pistol went off by accident in the sense that it
was not discharged by any act of Hughes done with the intention of discharging
it, and that if they so found they might properly have brought in a verdict of
manslaughter and that the learned trial judge erred in not leaving that issue
to them. 

The Crown appeals.

The jury would view the acts of
Hughes from the moment Mrs. Uno entered the shop as swiftly succeeding phases
of a single outrage and without doubt as evincing a reckless disregard of the
consequences of his shooting, and they would be quite justified in ascribing to
him a knowledge that his conduct was endangering the lives of the people whose
premises he was invading. They might not improperly infer that the shot which
occurred during the struggle (if they accepted the mother's story), following
at once upon the two shots fired into the sitting room, was intentionally fired
by him in that state of mind. If that was their conclusion, it would be their
duty to find him guilty of murder under section 259  (d) of the Criminal Code . I
think the learned trial judge in effect instructed them in this sense. He also
properly instructed them that they might find the same verdict if they accepted
the evidence of the brother.

Unfortunately, he did not deal
with the third hypothesis, the possibility that they might find the pistol was
discharged by accident in the sense mentioned.

The Crown adduced in evidence
against the accused the testimony of one Ciminelli, who deposed to an account
of

[Page 521]

the shooting given to him by
Hughes in a conversation on the evening of the date of the crime, the 16th of January, 1942. In examination in chief Ciminelli said that Hughes told him on that
occasion that

the Jap came for him and
struggled with him and then * * * and the gun went off.

On cross-examination Ciminelli
said that on the preliminary hearing he had given this version of the
conversation:—

Q. What was the
conversation? A. He told me that he was in a jam.

Q. What kind of a jam? A. He
told me he took some store, and the guy came for him, and struggled with him,
and the gun accidentally went off.

Q. Do you remember giving
that evidence? A. That is right.

Q. Your recollection was
clearer then than it is to-day, I take it? A. That is right.

As Parke J. said in Rex v.
Higgins [2]:—

Now, what a prisoner says is
not evidence, unless the prosecutor chooses to make it so, by using it as a
part of his case against the prisoner; however, if the prosecutor makes the
prisoner's declaration evidence, it then becomes evidence for the prisoner, as
well as against him; but still, like all evidence given in any case, it is for
you to say whether you believe it.

If the jury accepted Ciminelli's
version of Hughes' statement given at the preliminary hearing ("" that the
gun accidentally went off"") as a true account of that statement, then that
statement in its complete form was evidence in favour of the accused. It was,
of course, for the jury to consider whether this statement, having regard to
all the other evidence before them, satisfied them that the pistol in fact went
off by accident and not by the voluntary act of Hughes, or that it was only of
sufficient weight to leave their minds in a state of doubt on the point. If the
jury thought the pistol did not go off by the voluntary act of Hughes, or were
in serious doubt about it, then another question might arise; and here emerges
the real point for decision on this appeal.

Before stating that point, I
quote subsection (2)  of section 252 and subsection (d) of section 259  of
the Criminal Code :—

Section 252 (2) : Homicide is
culpable when it consists in the killing of any person * * * by causing a
person, by threats or fear of violence, or by deception, to do an act which
causes that person's death * * *

[Page 522]

Section 259 : Culpable
homicide is number. 

***

(d) If the offender,
for an unlawful object, does an act which he knows or ought to have known to be
likely to cause death, and thereby kills any person, though he may have desired
that his object should be effected without hurting any one.

I think I ought to say now, in
the clearest terms, that, in my opinion, even if the jury thought the pistol
went off by accident (or were not satisfied that it did not go off in that
manner) they might still have properly found a verdict of murder under these
sections if they were satisfied that the conduct of the accused was such that
he ought to have known it to be likely to induce such a struggle as that which
actually occurred, and that somebody's death was likely to be caused thereby
and that such was the actual effect of his conduct and of the struggle.

At p. 583 of his judgment,
delivered on behalf of the majority of the Court, in Graves v. The
King [3], Anglin
J. (as he then was) says:—

For the purposes of this
appeal I assume that under this provision it was not necessary, in order to
bring the charge of culpable homicide within it, that the jury should have
found that the acts of the defendants were such as they knew or should have
known were likely to cause the very acts to be done or the precise situation to
arise which in fact resulted in the homicide, or to cause the death of the
person who was killed, but that it would suffice if the jury had found that the
accused did an act which they knew or should have known would be likely to
induce the doing of anything or to bring about any situation likely to cause the
death of some person—the person killed or any other person.

I think this passage ought to be
accepted as stating the law as it is, not merely as it is assumed to be. To
repeat, I think the act of Yoshyuki in attempting to disarm Hughes and the
ensuing struggle were so clearly the natural and ordinary consequences of
Hughes' conduct that the jury might well, as reasonable men, have inferred that
Hughes ought to have anticipated some such occurrence and the probable
involuntary discharge of the pistol as a natural incident of the occurrence; it
would then be for them to say whether the conditions of clause (d) of
section 259  when read with subsection (2)  of section 252, were fulfilled. The
learned trial judge did not put this to the jury explicitly, but possibly it is
within the scope of his language.

[Page 523]

The learned judge, however, gave
the jury to understand that the accused must be acquitted if they did not find
them guilty of murder. I am forced to the conclusion that this was
misdirection.

The argument on behalf of the
Crown was based upon two decisions, Director of Public Prosecutions v.
Beard [4], and Rex
v. Elnick [5].

The rule laid down in the House
of Lords in Beard's case [6] is that
homicide arising from an act of violence in furtherance or in the course of the
crime of rape constitutes murder. In Beard's case [7]
it was proved that there was a violent struggle in which the accused
overpowered the child and stifled her cries by putting his hand over her mouth
and pressing his thumb upon her throat, the acts which, in her weakened state
resulting from the struggle, killed her. This, the House of Lords held, was
murder, although the accused had no intention of causing death.

I cannot agree that you can bring
within this rule the accidental discharge of the pistol admitted by Hughes. If
the pistol went off accidentally, in the sense mentioned above, it could hardly
be said as matter of law to be an act of violence done by the accused "" in
furtherance of or in the course of"" the crime of robbery in the sense of
the Lord Chancellor's judgment.

No question of accident in the
relevant sense arose in Beard's case [8]. There
was no question that the act which caused the suffocation, the act of the
prisoner in placing his hand on the mouth of the victim, was his voluntary act.
In the report of the case in the Criminal Appeal Reports[9],
there appears this passage in the judgment of the Lord Chief Justice:—

During a discussion on the
law applicable to the case the learned judge said that he should tell the jury
that if a man is engaged in violating the honour of a woman and she does her
best to defend herself and struggles, and the man does something which kills
her, to prevent her from screaming or struggling, it is murder. In summing up
he directed that ""if a man is assaulting a woman or girl, and the woman or
girl, in order to resist him screams and struggles, and the man, in order to
effect his purpose, puts his hand upon her mouth and suffocates her, he is
guilty of murder, and it is no use at all to say, 'I only intended to stop her
screaming. I did not intend to kill her.' That is no defence, in my
judgment.""

[Page 524] 

And at page 116:—

It was proved that there was
a struggle of a horrible description between this man, seeking to consummate
his desire, and this 13 years old girl. No questions were put in cross-examination
by Mr. Artemus Jones for the defence, to minimize the effect of the testimony
about the struggle that must have taken place. The child was straining every
nerve and muscle to escape him, and in order to overpower her and to stop her
struggles and screams he eventually did the act which resulted in her death. By
the law of England that is murder: it is an act of violence done in the
course or in furtherance of a felony involving violence, and beyond all
question and beyond the range of any controversy that is murder.

Again the judgment of the Lord
Chancellor makes it quite clear that the defence founded upon drunkenness was
not that Beard was so drunk as to be incapable of forming the intent to commit
rape, but that he was incapable of measuring or foreseeing the consequences of
his violent act, or that at the time of placing his hand on the child's mouth
he was incapable of knowing that what he was doing was dangerous. At p. 307 he
says:—

There was certainly no
evidence that he was too drunk to form the intent of committing rape. Under
these circumstances, it was proved that death was caused by an act of violence
done in furtherance of the felony of rape. Such a killing is by the law of England murder.

In this country a charge arising
out of circumstances such as those considered in Beard's case [10]
would be disposed of under the law laid down in section 260  of the Criminal
Code .

As regards Rex v.
Elnick [11], Mr.
Justice Cameron says at p. 431:—

The jury should have been
told that on the undisputed and admitted facts the killing of De Forge was
caused by an act of violence done by Elnick in furtherance of a crime of
violence, that the killing was therefore murder and that it was their duty to
return a verdict of guilty.

That is really the basis of the
decision in that case. Such a direction could not properly have been given in
this case, in view of the evidence set forth above as to accidental discharge.

The learned trial judge ought to
have told the jury that they might and ought to find a verdict of manslaughter
if they thought the pistol was not discharged by the voluntary act of Hughes,
and that Hughes did not anticipate

[Page 525]

and ought not to have anticipated
that his conduct might bring about a struggle in which somebody's death might
be caused.

Mr. Justice Fisher thinks that on
the evidence no reasonable jury could find that the discharge of the pistol was
accidental, or that there was sufficient evidence to raise a doubt upon that
point. There is much, very much, to be said for that view; I am not satisfied,
however, that if the issue of manslaughter had been left to the jury, they must
necessarily have found the verdict they did.

I think the learned trial judge
proceeded rightly in instructing the jury that in the circumstances of this
particular case the law to be applied is to be found in the Criminal Code . He
might well have called the attention of the jury to the second subsection of
section 252  and to the judgment of Anglin J. in Graves v.
The King [12]. As
this Court thought in Graves v. The King (1), I am quite
satisfied that the law to be applied to the circumstances of this case is to be
found in the Code and that we need not pass upon the question whether the
definitions in sections 252 , 259  and 260  Cr. C. are exhaustive.

The appeal, therefore, from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal, as it affects the conviction of Hughes, should
be dismissed; and it follows necessarily that the appeal in respect of the
other respondents must also be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Companies—False
statement by director—False by implication—Liability of director—Balance sheet
of company—Loan to company treated as cash asset—Particulars—Criminal Code ,
sections 413  and 414 .

APPEAL by the Attorney-General
for British Columbia from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] which (Macdonald C.J.B.C. and O'Halloran J.A.
dissenting) allowed the respondent's appeal and quashed the conviction of the
accused respondent.

The respondent, who was president
and managing director of the Freehold Oil Corporation Limited, obtained the sum
of $40,336.46 on the 31st of March, 1937, from an associate named Miller
through his secretary (Miller being away at the time) and deposited it to the
credit of the Freehold Company. In repayment thereof he handed the said
secretary six post-dated cheques of the Freehold Company aggregating the above
sum and dated respectively the 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, 13th and 14th of April,
1937. Three days later the Freehold Company's balance sheet was made up by the
company's chartered accountants, showing current assets as of March 31st, 1937,
to include "" cash in bank $48,789.76."" This amount included the sum
of $40,336.46 obtained by the respondent as aforesaid. Four days later at a
meeting of the directors the balance sheet was approved. The annual meeting of
the company was called for April 14th and a copy of the balance sheet was
directed to be forwarded to the shareholders with the notice calling the meeting.
No disclosure was made to the shareholders of the six post-dated cheques.
Particulars delivered pursuant to order stated that the false statement
consisted in entries in the books of the company showing a sale of shares of
another company for $40,336.46 and a re-purchase of the same number of shares
from a third company for the same amount, and an audited balance sheet showing
as an asset ""Cash in bank"" $48,789.76,

[Page 229]

which did not reflect the true
financial position of the respondent's company. The respondent was convicted
under section 414  of the Criminal Code , for that he, being a director of a
public company, did, with intent to deceive its shareholders, concur in making
a statement of its financial position which he knew to be false in a material
particular, viz., that the assets of the company consisted of $48,789.76 in
cash. The trial judge, Lennox Co.J., found that although on the material date
the company had cash in the bank in said amount, yet the statement was false in
that it did not show that of that amount $46,336.46 represented money borrowed
by the company which was still owing to the lender. The Court of Appeal
reversed that judgment, quashed the conviction and held (Macdonald C.J.B.C. and
O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) that while the respondent might have been charged
with falsifying the balance sheet at large in not showing the true state of the
company's affairs or that it was false in particular in not disclosing the
liability for the loan, nevertheless the respondent ought not to have been
convicted of making a false balance sheet as alleged in the terms of the
conviction, because in truth the company had in the bank to its credit the sum
of $48,789.76 and that sum was an asset of the company no matter what
liabilities there were against it: the Crown elected to complain of only one
item and that item by itself was unquestionably a true and not a false ""
material particular.""

On appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada, after hearing the arguments of counsel for the appellant and for the
respondent, the Court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day delivered
judgment allowing the appeal.

The judgment of the Court was

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA EN BANC

Criminal law—Evidence—Accused charged with
arson—Contention that accused arranged that other persons carry out the crime—Evidence
of conversations between such other persons—Admissibility—Questioning of accused,
in cross-examination, as to alleged fire at other premises than those in
question.

The accused appealed from the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, 15 M.P.R. 459, affirming his
conviction of having unlawfully and wilfully set fire to a store. The appeal
was based on certain objections of law, which were grounds of dissent in the
said Court en banc.

(1) One G. testified that accused hired him
to commit the crime and G. arranged with P. to do it. P. testified that he
secured the assistance of T. P. and T. gave evidence that they set the premises
on fire. It was objected that evidence of P. and T., particularly with
reference to their conversations with each other and with G., was improperly
admitted.

Held, that
this ground of appeal failed.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kerwin J.: The evidence of P. and T. did not implicate accused in
any way, but was admissible to prove the actual setting of the fire. Accused
was not charged with having conspired to commit arson and, as the trial judge explained
to the jury, the actions of P. and T. and the conversations between them were
relevant to the charge upon which accused was being tried only if the jury were
satisfied as to the truth of the evidence given by G. relating to his
conversation with accused.

Per Rinfret,
Crocket and Taschereau JJ.: Any acts done or words spoken in furtherance of the
common design may be given in evidence against all (Paradis v. The
King, [1934] S.C.R. 165). This rule applies to all indictments for crime,
and not only when the indictment is for conspiracy, and it also applies even if
the conspirator whose words or acts are tendered as evidence has not been
indicted (Cloutier v. The King, [1940] S.C.R. 131, at 137). These
principles were properly applied to the present case.

(2) It was objected that the prosecuting
officer, in cross-examining accused, had improperly questioned him as to an
alleged fire at other premises than those in question, which questioning had
greatly prejudiced accused with the jury.

Held: Effect
should be given to this objection; the appeal should be allowed and a new trial
ordered.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kerwin J.: The likely, if not the only, effect upon the jurymen of
said questioning would be that accused was a Person who was very apt to commit
the crime with which he was

[Page 482]

charged. A person charged with having
committed a crime is not only entitled to have placed before the jury only
evidence that is relevant to the issues before the court, but, when testifying
on his own behalf, he may not be asked questions that have no possible bearing
upon such issues and might only tend to prejudice a fair trial. The questioning
complained of could not be justified on the ground that it went to accused's
credibility: credibility cannot arise in connection with questions relating to
an extraneous matter that has not been opened by the examination in chief of
accused or otherwise on his behalf.

Pen Rinfret,
Crocket and Taschereau JJ.: An accused has, to answer the specific charge
mentioned in the indictment for which he is standing on trial, and the evidence
must be limited to matters relating to the transaction which forms the subject
of the indictment (Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935]
A.C. 309); otherwise the real issue may be distracted from the jury's minds,
and an atmosphere of guilt created, prejudicial to the accused. The accused
cannot be cross-examined on other criminal acts supposed to have been committed
by him, unless he has been convicted, or unless these acts are connected with
the offence charged and tend to prove it (Paradis v. The King, [1934]
S.C.R. 165, at 169), or unless they show a system or a particular intention, as
decided in Brunei v. The King, 57 Can. S.C.R. 83. The questioning
of accused complained of may have influenced the verdict of the jury and caused
accused a substantial wrong.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia en banc[1]
affirming (Hall and Archibald JJ. dissenting) the conviction of the appellant,
at trial before Doull J. and a jury, of having ""unlawfully, without legal
justification or excuse, and without colour of right, wilfully set fire""
to a certain store ""and did thereby commit arson.""

The questions before this Court on this
appeal, and the nature of the evidence or proceedings from which such questions
arose, are sufficiently set out in the reasons for judgment in this Court now
reported.

The appeal to this Court was allowed and a
new trial ordered.

J. W. Maddin K.C. and I. G. MacLeod for
the appellant.

Hon. J. H. MacQuarrie K.C. and M. A.
Patterson for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.
was delivered by

[Page 483]

Kerwin J.—The appellant Koufis was convicted on an indictment charging him
with having unlawfully set fire to a store known as Diana Sweets, in Sydney,
Nova Scotia, on or about April 18th, 1940. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia en banc, the conviction was affirmed. Mr. Justice Hall and
Mr. Justice Archibald dissented and would have ordered a new trial on the
ground that the prosecuting officer, in cross-examining the accused, had
improperly questioned him as to an alleged fire at premises known as the London
Grill, in Sydney, which greatly prejudiced the accused with the jury. Mr.
Justice Hall also dissented on the ground that the evidence of two witnesses
called by the Crown (Pentecost and Thistle), particularly with reference to
their conversations with each other and with one Jerome Gerrior, was improperly
admitted in evidence.

Koufis appealed to this Court against the
affirmance of this conviction on these two questions of law. As to the second
point, we announced at the hearing that we would not require to hear counsel
for the respondent, as we considered the evidence of the two men admissible. As
to the first, we have had the advantage of a complete argument and we have
determined that the questions referred to were improperly asked.

At one time Koufis was a partner in the
restaurant and confectionery business known as Diana Sweets and also in a
similar business operated under the name of the London Grill. He sold his
interest in both and left Sydney. Upon his return to that city, he desired to
become a partner in the Diana Sweets business again but that was not acceptable
to some, if not all, of the then members of the partnership. Thereupon he, with
others, commenced a third business known as the Dome, which was still in
operation on April 18th, 1940.

On that date the store in which the Diana Sweets
business was carried on and which was known by that name was destroyed by fire
and it was in connection with that fire that Koufis was charged with arson. The
basis for the charge was the evidence of Gerrior. He testified that Koufis had
promised to pay him a sum of money to burn Diana Sweets and had said to him:
""If you are scared to do it, get somebody else and give him half the money
"";

[Page 484]

and that he (Gerrior) accordingly arranged with
Pentecost to do the work. The latter testified that he in turn secured the
assistance of Thistle. Both Pentecost and Thistle gave evidence that they set
the premises on fire, and the learned trial judge, therefore, was quite
accurate when he stated in his charge to the jury: ""so, if you give effect
to that evidence, it is clear that somebody is guilty of the crime of arson.""

The trial judge put to the jury as the crux of
the case: ""Did the accused directly or through Gerrior procure Thistle and
Pentecost to set the fire?"" He instructed the jury as to the danger of
convicting upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice and also told
them that there was no corroboration of the stories told by Gerrior, Pentecost
and Thistle. The evidence of the last two did not implicate Koufis in any way
but was admissible to prove the actual setting of the fire. Koufis was not
charged with having conspired to commit arson and, as the trial judge
explained, the actions of Pentecost and Thistle and the conversations between
themselves were relevant to the charge upon which Koufis was being tried only
if the jury were satisfied as to the truth of the evidence given by Gerrior
relating to his conversations with the accused. On this point we are satisfied
that the appeal could not succeed.

Turning now to the first point, we find that
when John Raptis, one of the partners in Diana Sweets and a witness on behalf
of the Crown, was testifying in chief as to the conversation between him and
the accused when the latter wanted to again become a partner in that business,
the following occurred:—

Q. Tell us what he said.

A. Lots of us down on Charlotte street and
we get along very well. I never saw him until he got the Dome down to the
Capital, and I met him one night before the first Dome was burned and he ask me
""You have to raise the price, no money in the meals"" and I say we are
doing all right; and I saw him again after the fire, the first fire in the
Dome.

Q. A year ago?

A. Two years ago in August.

Q. It was before that first fire he
complained to you about the prices?

A. Yes, wanted to increase the prices.
After he was at this Dome I never see him except in Church, just say
""hello.""

Q. You were not talking to him after the
fire?

A. No.

[Page 485]

This was the first mention in the evidence of
any fire other than the one in question.

The following appears in the examination in
chief of Gerrior when he was asked as to whether he had seen Koufis about two
weeks before Christmas of 1939 after an accidental fire had occurred in Diana
Sweets:—

A. Yes, two days after. I told him about it
and he said ""Why did you not leave it burn"" and I said
""Why?"" and he said ""If you had leave it burn I would give you
$50."" I let it go at that. Couple of days after I met him and he asked me
to go down and see him, and I did go down about twelve at night. He told me if
I burn the Diana he would give me $350; he did not like them, they did not come
up to his place and they were no good; he wanted them destroyed. He told me how
it could foe done. He said ""You could burn it and nobody would suspect you
because you are a fireman. When the other Dome burned nobody suspected the fireman
and no questions asked to him.""

Q. Was he at the other Dome when it burned?

A. He was running it.

Later in his testimony in chief, in the course
of an answer to a question, he stated: ""After the Dome Grill burned I went
to see Koufis.""

Testifying on his own behalf, the accused, in
answer to his own counsel and with reference to the Dome business, was asked:—

Q. And you were burned out?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you do then?

A. We have heavy loss in the fire. We lose
$5,000 and another $4,000. Either $9,000 or $10,000 altogether.

In cross-examination he was asked what he
considered the Diana Sweets business was worth at the time he sold his interest
in it.

A. $28,000 or $27,000 besides the good
will.

Q. Was the Diana Sweets worth more then
than at the time of your last fire?

A. I don't know. That is for the time I was
there.

Later in cross-examination he was asked a number
of questions as to the amount of insurance that had been carried on the Dome
business at the time of a fire there. While we are not concerned with the
evidence as to any fire at the Dome restaurant since no dissent is based on the
admission of that evidence, I have referred to it in order to show how those
fires came to be mentioned. Then

[Page 486]

followed the evidence with reference to the
London Grill, upon which the dissent below has been based and which evidence I
transcribe:—

Q. Did you own the London Grill?

A. Yes, four partners.

Q. What four partners?

A. Roy Woodill, Russell Urquhart, myself
and Gus Mandros.

Q. That place burned too?

A. Never.

Q. Never a fire there?

A. Never a fire there in the London Grill?

Q. Do you mean the London Grill situated on
the corner of Charlotte and Wentworth streets was never on fire at any time?

A. Never have any claim for fire insurance.

Q. Was there a fire there?

A. Inside the store?

Q. Yes.

A. The London store never had a fire. The
building next to it. There are two places there, the London Grill on one side
and groceries on the other.

Q. The two are under one roof?

A. Absolutely.

Q. And this fire was in the partition
between the two?

A. No, started at the end of the building.

Q. Was it underneath the building the fire
started?

A. I don't know, the other end.

Q. It was underneath the building, wasn't
it?

A. No, not in our basement.

Q. Wasn't it underneath the building?

A. I don't know.

Q. Anyway, the building that the London
Grill was in caught fire?

A. Yes.

This was the only reference to a fire at or near
the London Grill and the likely effect, if not the only effect, upon the
jurymen of this line of cross-examination, particularly the questions ""Was
it underneath the building the fire started"" and ""It was underneath
the building, wasn't it"" and ""Wasn't it underneath the
building,"" would be that the accused was a person who was very apt to
commit the crime with which he was charged. In fact, the trial judge stated to
the jury: ""The only reason he would be asked about another fire is to show
he was likely to start this."" Again there is no dissent as to the charge
and I mention it merely to indicate that any doubt in the mind of the jury as
to the purpose of these questions would be set at rest by this comment.

By section 4 of the Canada Evidence Act , every
person charged with an offence is a competent witness for the defence, and by
section 12 , a witness may be questioned

[Page 487]

as to whether he has been convicted of any
offence and upon being so questioned, if he either denies the fact or refuses
to answer, the opposite party may prove such conviction. We are not concerned
on this appeal with the question as to when the prosecution is entitled to give
evidence of the bad character of an accused because it is not suggested that
Koufis had been convicted of any crime in connection with the fire at the
London Grill, or that he had been even charged with any such crime, or in fact
that any crime had been committed by anyone. A person charged with having
committed a crime is not only entitled to have placed before the jury only
evidence that is relevant to the issues before the Court, but, when testifying
on his own behalf, he may not be asked questions that have no possible bearing
upon such issues and might only tend to prejudice a fair trial. In the opinion
of the majority of the Supreme Court en banc, these questions were
justified on the ground that they went to the credibility of the accused, but
credibility cannot arise in connection with questions relating to an extraneous
matter that has not been opened by the examination in chief of the accused or
otherwise on his behalf. The conviction should be set aside and a new trial
ordered.

The judgment of Rinfret, Crocket and Taschereau
JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau J.—The appellant, William Koufis, has been found guilty of the crime
of arson and sentenced to serve five years in Dorchester Penitentiary. The
Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia confirmed this conviction (Hall and Archibald
JJ. dissenting).

There is no suggestion that the accused set fire
himself to the building called the Diana Sweets which was burned, but the
contention of the Crown is that the accused hired one Jerome Gerrior to commit
the crime and that the latter offered Clayton Pentecost one hundred and
seventy-five dollars ($175), who shared this sum with Edward Thistle to burn
the premises. The grounds of appeal are the following:—

1. The evidence of Clayton Pentecost and Edward
Thistle, particularly with reference to their conversations

[Page 488]

with each other and Jerome Gerrior, was
inadmissible in the trial against William Koufis and was improperly-admitted in
evidence.

2. The accused was greatly prejudiced in his
defence by the publication and circulation in the City of Sydney and
surrounding districts of a certain newspaper known as The Steelworker and
Miner, which charged the accused with having committed the offence
hereinbefore recited as well as imputing to him, the said William Koufis, the
crime of arson in connection with fires which have occurred at premises known
as the Dome Grill at Sydney, as well as with an alleged fire at premises known
as the London Grill at Sydney, and an alleged fire in a bowling alley in
Sydney.

3. The learned prosecuting officer for the
County of Cape Breton in cross-examining the accused improperly questioned him
as to fires in the said Dome Grill and the London Grill, which greatly
prejudiced the accused with the jury.

I believe that the first ground of appeal is
unfounded. It is well settled law that any acts done or words spoken in
furtherance of the common design may be given in evidence against all (Paradis
v. The King[2]).
This rule applies to all indictments for crime, and not only when the
indictment is for conspiracy, and it also applies even if the conspirator whose
words or acts are tendered as evidence has not been indicted (Cloutier v.
The King[3]).
These principles were properly applied to the present case, and I believe that
the conversations between Gerrior, Pentecost and Thistle were rightly admitted
in evidence.

The appellant further submits that even if such
an evidence is legal, there must be some independent evidence of conspiracy
before the statements of co-conspirators, become admissible one against the
other. Although the pronouncements on this ground have not always been
unanimous, the matter has been definitely settled in the case of The King v.
Paradis, cited supra, and which was based on a decision rendered
by the Supreme Court of

[Page 489]

British Columbia (The King v. Hutchinson[4]). In the case of Paradis
v. The King[5],
Mr. Justice Rinfret, giving the judgment of the Court, said:—

Nor would it be error for a trial judge to
permit proof of acts of alleged conspiracy to be given in evidence before the
agreement to conspire has been established, if the latter is in fact proved
during the course of the trial.

The second point raised by the appellant is that
the accused has been prejudiced by the publication of certain articles in The
Steelworker and Miner.

The articles complained of were certainly of a
serious character, as they clearly stated that the appellant was the party
responsible for several fires which occurred in Sydney some time before the trial.
These articles, however, were not referred to at the trial and were put in the
record only when the case reached the Court of Appeal. An affidavit was filed
signed by I. J. MacLeod to the effect that The Steelworker and Miner is
widely circulated throughout the County of Cape Breton and the City of Sydney;
but there is nothing in the record or the evidence to show that the members of
the jury had any knowledge of the contents of these articles nor that they did
not give a free unbiased verdict. Under these circumstances, I am of opinion
that the appellant cannot succeed on this point.

The third ground of appeal is much more serious
and is obviously the one on which the appellant practically rests his whole
case. It raises the question of the cross-examination of the accused by the
solicitor for the respondent on previous fires which occurred at the Dome Grill
and at the London Grill at Sydney. The learned judges, however, do not enter a
formal dissent as to the cross-examination on the fire which destroyed the Dome
Grill, but they dissent on the ground that the accused has been improperly
cross-examined as to the alleged fire at the London Grill. The Canada
Evidence Act , section 12 , says:—

A witness may be questioned as to whether
he has been convicted of any offence, and upon being so questioned, if he
either denies the fact or refuses to answer, the opposite party may prove such
conviction.

If the accused admits having committed the
offence, the answer, being a collateral one, is obviously final. If he

[Page 490]

denies having committed the offence, then the
conviction may be proved by legal means provided for in subsection 2,
paragraphs (a) and (b), of section 12 . The authority given to the
Grown is to cross-examine the accused on previous convictions, but this
section 12  cannot be interpreted as meaning that the accused may be
cross-examined on offences which he is suspected of having committed but for
which he has not been convicted.

When an accused is tried before the Criminal
Courts, he has to answer the specific charge mentioned in the indictment for
which he is standing on trial, ""and the evidence must be limited to
matters relating to the transaction which forms the subject of the indictment""
(Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions[6]). Otherwise, ""the
real issue may be distracted from the minds of the jury,"" and an
atmosphere of guilt may be created which would indeed prejudice the accused.

In the present case, the accused was asked in
cross-examination if he had owned the London Grill? If that place had burned
too? If the fire had started underneath the building? All these questions
were obviously asked in order to convey to the jury the impression that the
accused had set fire previously to another building, and to establish the
possibility that he committed the offence for which he is now charged. The
accused cannot be cross-examined on other criminal acts supposed to have been
committed by him, unless he has been convicted, or unless these acts are
connected with the offence charged and tend to prove it (Paradis v. The
King[7]), or unless they show a
system or a particular intention as decided in Brunei v. The King[8]. It is clear to my mind
that this cross-examination may have influenced the verdict of the jury and
caused the accused a substantial wrong.

I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

The "" court of

right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, upon leave to appeal being
granted, "" if the judgment appealed from conflicts with the judgment of
any court of appeal"" does not include any courts other than Canadian

the appellant.

respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—I have no
hesitation in expressing my agreement with the conclusion of my brother Rinfret
in Arcadi v. The King[1],
that the courts of appeal, contemplated by section 1025  of the Criminal Code ,
do not include any courts other than Canadian courts.

In addition to the reasons of my
brother Rinfret, I may add that the interpretation very ably contended for by
Mr. Newcombe (that conflict with a decision on a criminal appeal in England is
sufficient to give jurisdiction under that section) might open up in any case
the question whether the judgment in which leave to appeal was prayed was
inconsistent with the decisions of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved, of the
Exchequer Chamber, of the House of Lords, or of the Privy Council; in other
words, might open up a field of examination so broad as to trench upon the
limitation in section 1023 to a degree probably not contemplated by section
1025 .

Then, the Chief Justice, after
dealing with the merits of the case, dismissed the application.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—War Measures—Regulation made by
Governor in Council—No sanction provided—Application of section 164  of the
Criminal Code —Regulation to ""have the force of law""—Whether deemed to
be an Act of Parliament—War Measures Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 206, ss. 3(2) and
4—Criminal Code , ss. 2(1)  and 164 .

An order or regulation made by the Governor
in Council under the War Measures Act, although it is thereby enacted
that such order or regulation ""shall have the force of law,"" is not
an enactment passed by Parliament, i.e., an Act of Parliament, but is merely an
enactment passed by the Government.

When an accused is charged of having
disobeyed such an order or regulation, for the violation of which no penalty or
other mode of punishment has been expressly provided, the disobedience so
complained of is not punishable under section 164  of the Criminal Code , which
relates only to violations of Acts of Parliament or of provincial legislatures.

Davis and Hudson JJ. dissenting.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General for Quebec
from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], which (Barclay and Francoeur JJ.
dissenting) dismissed the Attorney-General's appeal against the acquittal of
the accused by Guérin C.E., Judge of Sessions of the Peace[2] on an information for violation of a
regulation, restricting the sale of codeine, made by the Governor in Council
under section 3 of the War Measures Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 206, such
violation allegedly constituting wilful disobedience of an Act of the
Parliament, contrary to section 164  of the Criminal Code .

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now
reported.

O. Legrand K.C. for the appellant.

L. Gendron K.C. for the respondent.

[Page 112]

The judgment of Rinfret and Crocket JJ. was
delivered by

Rinfret J.—The War Measures Act was enacted in 1914. With certain
modifications, it has remained in the statutes and is now found in chapter 206
of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927.

Its object is to confer special powers to the
Governor in Council, which he may, by reason of the existence of real or
apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the
security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada.

The Act reads (subs. 2 of s. 3) as follows:

All orders and regulations made under this
section shall have the force of law, and shall be enforced in such manner and
by such courts, officers and authorities as the Governor in Council may
prescribe, and may be varied, extended or revoked by any subsequent order or
regulation.

The Governor in Council is by sec. 4 of the Act
empowered to

prescribe the penalties that may be imposed
for violations of orders and regulations made under this Act, and

(to)

also prescribe whether such penalties shall
be imposed upon summary conviction or upon indictment, but no such penalty
shall exceed a fine of five thousand dollars or imprisonment for any term not
exceeding five years, or both fine and imprisonment.

On the 11th day of September, 1939, purporting
to act under the provisions of the War Measures Act and upon a report of
the Minister of Pensions and National Health, the Governor in Council made an
order to the following effect, amongst others:

2. No retail druggist shall sell or supply
straight Codeine, whether in powder, tablet or liquid form, or preparations
containing any quantity of any of the narcotic drugs mentioned in Parts I and
II of the Schedule to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, mixed with
medicinal or other ingredients, except upon the written order or prescription
therefor signed and dated by a physician, veterinary surgeon or dentist whose
signature is known to the said druggist, or, if unknown, duly verified before
such order or prescription is filled. No such order or prescription shall be
filled upon more than one occasion, and it shall be filed by such retail
druggist and be available for subsequent inspection.

3. Any person found in possession of
Codeine or preparation containing narcotic drugs mentioned in Parts I and II of
the Schedule to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, mixed with other
medicinal ingredients, save and except under the authority of a licence from
the Minister

[Page 113]

of Pensions and National Health first had
and obtained, or other lawful authority, shall be liable to the penalties
provided upon summary conviction under the provisions of Section 4 of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act.

The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act referred
to in the above quoted paragraphs of the Order is a Dominion statute (R.S.C.,
1927, c. 144) which, as stated, contains a schedule wherein certain narcotic
drugs are enumerated and which, up to the date of the Order, did not include
Codeine.

Under the provisions of that Order, on November
6th, 1939, a charge was laid against the respondent, a retail druggist of the
city of Montreal, for that

he did, without lawful excuse, disobey an
Act of the Parliament of Canada for which no penalty or other mode of
punishment is expressly provided, to wit: Paragraph two of regulations dated
11th day of September, 1939, of the War Measures Act, Chapter 206 of
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, by wilfully selling Codeine, a narcotic drug
mentioned in Part Two of the Schedule to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act without
first having had and obtained a written order or prescription therefor signed
and dated by a physician, the whole contrary to Sec. 164  Criminal Code  of
Canada.

As must have been noted, the charge stated that
""no penalty or other mode of punishment is expressly provided""; and
it is a fact that the order or regulation under which the charge was laid does
not contain any provision for a ""penalty or other mode of
punishment.""

On this charge, the trial judge (C. E. Guérin,
Judge of Sessions of the Peace) liberated the accused and dismissed the
complaint on the ground that the order or regulation, as a consequence of which
the charge was laid, was not an ""Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any
legislature of Canada,"" and that, therefore, section 164  of the Criminal
Code  did not apply.

Upon appeal, this judgment was affirmed
(Tellier, C.J., St. Germain and Bond, JJ. forming the majority; Barclay and
Francœur, JJ. dissenting). The formal judgment specifies as follows the ground
in law on which the dissent is based:

Sur le motif qu'en loi le règlement en
question doit être considéré comme faisant partie de la Loi des Mesures de
Guerre, et que partant il y a lieu à l’application de l’article 164  C. Cr.

The Attorney-General is now before this Court
under section 1023  of the Criminal Code  on the question of law over which there
has been dissent in the court of appeal.

[Page 114]

Section 164  of the Criminal Code  enacts
specifically that the offence must consist in wilfully doing any act which is forbidden,
or omitting to do any act which is required to be done by an ""Act of the
Parliament of Canada.""

It is an Act of the Parliament of Canada which
the guilty person must have disobeyed without lawful excuse. And under those
circumstances, if some penalty or other mode of punishment has not been
otherwise expressly provided by law, the person found guilty is declared to be
""liable to one year's imprisonment."" In the present case, although
the respondent was charged of having disobeyed an Act of Parliament for which
no penalty or other mode of punishment was expressly provided, it is stated in
the information and complaint that the disobedience complained of was in
reality a disobedience to paragraph 2 of the regulation already referred to in
this judgment.

The information is, therefore, for having
disobeyed not an Act of Parliament, but a regulation made under an Act of the
Parliament of Canada.

I agree with the trial judge and with the
majority of the court of appeal that, in the premises, section 164  of the
Criminal Code  has no application.

Of course, the War Measures Act enacts
that the orders and regulations made under it ""shall have the force of
law."" It cannot be otherwise. They are made to be obeyed and, as a
consequence, they must have the force of law. But that is quite a different
thing from saying that they will be deemed to be an Act of Parliament.

An Act of Parliament is defined in the Criminal
Code  (sec. 2 -1 ). It is there declared to include

an Act passed or to be passed by the
Parliament of Canada, or any Act passed by the legislature of the late province
of Canada, or passed or to be passed by the legislature of any province of
Canada, or passed by the legislature of any province now a part of Canada,
before it was included therein.

In terms, therefore, the words: ""Act of the
Parliament of Canada"" do not include regulations made under the provisions
of such Act. It is clearly indicated in section 2 (1) —which is the
Interpretation clause of the Criminal Code —that, in order to come under the appellation
of an Act, the enactment must have been ""passed by the Parliament of
Canada"" or ""by the legislature of any province of Canada,"" etc.

[Page 115]

A regulation made under an Act, and in
particular a regulation under the War Measures Act, is not an enactment
passed by Parliament; it is an enactment made by the Government.

An Act of Parliament, in order to become law and
to form part of the statutes of Canada, must be adopted by the House of
Commons, the Senate and receive the Royal Assent. It is debated publicly, to
the knowledge of the public, and it comes into force on the day of its sanction
by Royal Assent, which is given publicly.

The regulation takes the form of an Order in
Council, debated secretly by the Privy Council and, generally speaking, will
come into force as soon as it is signed by the Governor General, without there
being any essential requirement for its publication.

These circumstances show the great difference
between the Act of Parliament and the Order in Council, in so far as the people
is concerned; and the difference takes even more importance when it is applied
to section 164  of the Criminal Code , which requires for the guilt of an accused
that he should have been doing or omitting any act ""wilfully"" and
""without lawful excuse.""

An additional point in respect of the difference
between an Act of Parliament or a statute and an Order in Council may be found
in the Act respecting the Publication of the Statutes (ch. 2 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1927) and in the Canada Evidence Act , with regard to
evidence and to judicial knowledge.

It should be further noted that the delegation
of powers to the Governor in Council, as expressed in the War Measures Act with
regard to orders and regulations, merely enacts that these orders and regulations

shall have the force of law, and shall be
enforced in such manner and by such courts, officers and authorities as the
Governor in Council may prescribe,

with further power given to the Governor in
Council to ""prescribe the penalties that may be imposed for
violation"" etc. These provisions in the Act are far from being as strong,
for the purpose of the appellant's argument, as the similar provision
contained, for example, in the Bankruptcy Act (c. 11, R.S.C., 1927):
""Such rules shall be judicially noticed and shall have effect as if
enacted

[Page 116]

by this Act"" (s. 161, par. 3), or in the Explosives
Act  (c. 62, R.S.C., 1927):

All regulations made under this Act * * *
shall have the same for.ce as if they formed part of this Act (s.
5, par. 2),

or in the Fisheries Act (c. 73 of R.S.C.,
1927):

Every offence against any regulation made
under this Act may be stated as in violation of this Act (s. 46).

or in the Meat and Canned Foods Act (c.
77, R.S.C., 1927):

Such orders and regulations shall have the
same force and effect as if embodied in this Act (s. 4, par. 2).

In the statute now under consideration,
provisions equivalent to those just quoted are nowhere to be found; and, on the
contrary, the clear distinction between the Act itself and the regulations made
under the Act is recognized.

One would think that if Parliament intended the
regulations under the War Measures Act to be considered by the courts as
forming part of the Act and, therefore, to be susceptible of the application of
section 164  of the Criminal Code , Parliament would have said so at least in
similar language to that employed in the several Acts just above referred to.

Far from it, in paragraph 3 of the regulation
made on the 11th day of September, 1939, the Governor in Council provides for
penalties, and it is said therein that these penalties will be imposed
""under the provisions of section 4 of the Opium and Narcotics
Act,"" thus relieving any offence against paragraph 3 of the regulation
from the application of section 164  of the Criminal Code .

That indeed would lend colour to the
respondent's argument that the regulations now under discussion, although in
terms passed in virtue of the powers given to the Governor in Council by the War
Measures Act, were, in fact, meant to affect the schedule of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, to which both the preamble of the Order in Council
and paragraphs 2 and 3 thereof specifically refer. And it is interesting to
note that, under that Act, the Governor in Council may make such orders and
regulations as are deemed necessary or expedient for the carrying out of the
intention of the Act, or may from time to time add to the schedule of the Act;
but every Order

[Page 117]

in Council in that behalf must be published in
the Canada Gazette and shall take effect only at the expiration of
thirty days from the date of such publication (ss. 21 & 22).

The question is not whether the consent of
Parliament may be expressed by delegated authority and that consequently it is
not necessary that an Act should be complete when it emerges from the debates
in Parliament or at the time it leaves the hands of the legislative body; but
the only question we have to decide in this case is whether the Orders in
Council made by force of the delegated authority are to be deemed equivalent to
an Act of Parliament within the meaning of section 164  of the Criminal Code . It
is not to the purpose to call them ""subordinate legislation"" or the
""complement of the legislation,"" for there is no denying the fact
that the regulations provided for in the War Measures Act are not
declared by Parliament to form part and parcel of the Act itself; and whether
they are as effectual for the purpose of obedience and disobedience of the
subject, they are not assimilable to the Act itself; and so far as concerns the
application of section 164 of the Code, they may not be treated as if they had
been enacted and were incorporated in the War Measures Act.

This view, it seems to me, is further
strengthened by the fact that, by force of the Act itself, Parliament put it in
the hands of the Governor in Council to prescribe the penalties that may be
imposed for violation of the regulations, thus indicating further its intention
that the matter should not be left to the general provisions contained in
section 164 of the Code.

We have not here a statute such as was under
consideration by the House of Lords in the case of Chartered Institute of
Patent Agents v. Lockwood[3], where
the words of the Act were that the rules ""shall be of the same effect as
if they were contained in this Act and shall be judicially noticed."" The
distinction between that Act and the War Measures Act is abundantly
clear.

So, in the case before the House of Lords in Minister
of Health v. The King (on the prosecution of Yaffe) [4], where the language was:

The order of the Minister, when made, shall
have effect as if enacted in this Act.

[Page 118]

It was held there that this enactment did not
preclude the Court from calling in question the order of the Minister, where
the scheme presented to him for confirmation is inconsistent with the
provisions of the Act, although in the particular case the scheme, whatever its
defects, was found to be an improvement scheme within the meaning of the Act.
However, it is evident that the wording of the statute discussed in that case
was far different from the wording of the War Measures Act, in so far as
it concerns the point now submitted to this Court.

We have been referred also to a number of other
decisions rendered in English cases. I have very serious doubt whether, in any
event, these decisions could be allowed to prevail against our Criminal Code 
and the plain language of section 164 . But, moreover, in those cases, the
English courts were called upon to interpret statutes differing in language and
in aim from the Acts now before this Court (see Lord Davey in Commissioners
of Taxation v. Kirk[5]; and
there is a clear distinction to be made between the present case and those in
which the decisions referred to were rendered. In the latter, the offences
against the regulations were common law misdemeanours before the statutes or
the regulations prohibited them; in the matter now before us, the sale of
Codeine never was in itself a misdemeanour; it was not even prohibited by the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act before the regulation of the 11th of September, 1939,
came into force under the provisions of the War Measures Act, and for
purposes which are there stated as being due to the existence of war. As I read
the decisions, where an act, heretofore a misdemeanour at common law, is
subsequently made an offence under the Criminal Code  or under a statute or by
virtue of the regulations made thereunder, if the code or the statute provides
for no penalty as a consequence of the doing of the act which it prohibits, or
of omitting the act which it requires to be done, the law steps in and
establishes the mode of punishment; but if the act is made an offence merely as
a result of the regulations and, I repeat, was not, up to the coming into force
of the regulation, a common law misdemeanour, then the penalty must be found
either in the regulation itself or must have been provided for by the Act of
Parliament

[Page 119]

or the statute under which the regulation is
made, or otherwise the regulation is inoperative for want of any sanction.

For all these reasons, I am of the opinion that
section 164  of the Criminal Code  does not apply to a charge such as that
brought against the respondent and that, under the circumstances, the
information and charge was rightly dismissed by the trial judge and by the
Court of King's Bench.

The appeal to this Court should, therefore, be
disallowed.

The judgment of Davis and Hudson JJ.
(dissenting) was delivered by

Hudson J.—The
question for decision in this case is whether or not the breach of a duty
validly created by an Order in Council passed under the War Measures Act is
a breach of that statute itself, within the meaning of article 164  of the
Criminal Code .

The power of Parliament to pass the War
Measures Act is not now open to question; nor is there any doubt about the
power of the Governor in Council under the provisions of this Act to pass the
particular order under consideration: see In Re Gray[6]; Rex v. Halliday[7].

There is, however, in the Order in Council in
question no provision for punishment in case of violation of its orders or
regulations, although by the statute the Governor in Council were given express
powers to impose penalties within prescribed limits.

In view of the absence of such a provision, the
prosecution in this case was based on article 164  of the Criminal Code , which
reads as follows:

Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who, without lawful excuse,
disobeys any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any legislature in Canada,
by wilfully doing any act which it forbids, or omitting to do any act which it
requires to be done, unless some penalty or other mode of punishment is
expressly provided by law.

The matter was heard in the first instance
before Judge Guérin, Judge of the Sessions of the Peace at Montreal, who gave a
considered judgment, in which he came to the conclusion that article 164  did
not apply on the ground

[Page 120]

that the offence charged was a violation of an
Order in Council and not of a statute. On appeal to the Court of King's Bench,
this was affirmed by a majority of the court, Mr. Justice Barclay and Mr.
Justice Francœur dissenting.

At common law it was well settled that either a
breach of a statute which concerns the public or any part of the public even
where no penalty was prescribed, or a breach of an order or regulation passed
under the authority of such a statute, was indictable: see Hawkins' Pleas of
the Crown, 1824 edition, page 65, and The King v. Harris[8]. The general rule as stated in Stephen's
Digest of the Criminal Law, article 166, is as follows:

Every one commits a misdemeanour who
wilfully disobeys any statute of the realm by doing any act which it forbids,
or by omitting to do any act which it requires to be done, and which concerns
the public or any part of the public, unless it appears from the statute that
it was the intention of the Legislature to provide some other penalty for such
disobedience.

and in support of this article the learned
author refers to the common law authorities above referred to, as well as
others. The article as drawn by him in this Digest appeared in substantially
the same form in the draft Bill attached to the Report of the English Royal
Commission on Criminal Law, 1880.

A similar statement is made by the late Mr.
Justice Burbidge in his Digest of Criminal Law of Canada, 1890, at page 115, in
the following language:

Every one commits a misdemeanour who
wilfully disobeys any statute by doing any act which it forbids or by omitting
to do any act which it requires to be done, and which concerns the public or
any part of the public, unless it appears from the statute that it was the
intention of the Legislature to provide some other penalty for such
disobedience.

The Canadian Criminal Code, as will be seen,
follows very closely the language of this article. Beyond this and the statutes
referred to by Judge Guérin and the Interpretation Act, there seems to
be nothing bearing on the history of the present article 164 of the Code.

Section 2 of the War Measures Act provides
that ""all orders and regulations made under this section shall have the
force of law.""

Parliament has said to residents of Canada: ""You must obey what is
prescribed by the Governor General in Council within the limits of the
authority we here give

[Page 121]

them."" If a person fails to observe the
requirements of an Order in Council legally passed under this Act, he, in my
opinion, disobeys the requirements of the statute itself, and in support of
this, reference might be made to the case of Willingale v. Norris[9]. The head-note is:

Where a statute gives power to an authority
to make regulations, a breach of the regulations so made is an offence against
the provisions of the statute.

A breach of regulations made under s. 4 of
the Hackney Carriages Act, 1850, for enforcing order at standings for
hackney carriages, is subject to the penalty of 40s. provided by s. 19 of the Hackney
Carriage Act, 1853, for offences against that Act; inasmuch as the effect
of s. 21 of the Act of 1853, which provides that the Acts of 1850 and 1853 are
to be construed as one Act, is that s. 4 of the Act of 1850 has the same
operation as if it were in fact contained in the Act of 1853, and therefore an
offence against regulations made under s. 4 of the Act of 1850 is an offence
against the Act of 1853.

Lord Alverstone, C.J. said at page 64:

I am of opinion that the effect of the
provision contained in s. 21 of the Act of 1853 was to make one code or statute
for the regulation of hackney carriages, and that therefore a general penal
clause for breach of the provisions of the Act of 1853 would apply to any
provision contained in the three Acts of 1843, 1850, and 1853. That is the
natural effect of this legislation where there are amending Acts intended to be
read as one statute. If it be said that a regulation is not a provision of an
Act, I am of opinion that R. v. Walker[10]
is an authority against that proposition. I should certainly have been prepared
to hold apart from authority that, where a statute enables an authority to make
regulations, a regulation made under the Act becomes for the purpose of
obedience or disobedience a provision of the Act. The regulation is only the
machinery by which Parliament has determined whether certain things shall or
shall not be done.

and Mr. Justice Bigham at page 66:

In my opinion, to break the regulations
made under the authority of a statute is to break the statute itself.

and Mr. Justice Walton at page 67:

Upon the second question, again not without
some difficulty, I have come to the conclusion that in the present case there
was charged against the respondent an ""offence against the provisions of
this Act"" within the meaning of s. 19 of the Act of 1853. It seems clear
that the Act of 1850 must be read as one—construed as one—with the Act of 1853,
and therefore s. 4 of the Act of 1850 has now exactly the same effect as if it
were in fact a section contained in the Act of 1853, and I have come to the
conclusion that, if the facts should be proved hereafter, there was a breach of
the provisions of s. 4 of the Act of 1850. That section gives power to make
regulations, and I think there is involved in this that regulations so made
must be obeyed, and if so it follows that a breach of such regulations is a
breach of the law contained in that sect-

[Page 122]

ion. Section 4 of the Act of 1850 is made a
provision of the Act of 1853, and therefore I think that the alleged offence
was one ""against the provisions of this Act"" within the
meaning of s. 19 of the Act of 1853. My difficulty has been—and I had
considerable doubt about it at first—as to whether the words ""provisions
of this Act"" can be read as meaning or including ""regulations
made under this Act,"" assuming that the regulations were made under this
Act, i.e., under the Act of 1853; whether there is not a distinction between
provisions of the Act and regulations made under the Act; and whether one can
read s. 19 of the Act of 1853 as if the words were ""for every offence
against the provisions of this Act, or regulations made under this Act.""
The doubt largely arises from the fact that in the Act of 1853 there is a
series of provisions, e.g., in ss. 14, 15 and 16, which are express provisions
of the Act, and to which directly, and naturally, the words of s. 19 apply. My
doubt is whether s. 19 was intended to apply to anything beyond offences
against express provisions contained in the Act of 1853. However, on the whole
I have come to the conclusion that it applies to any breach of what must be
construed as being a provision of the Act of 1853. In my judgment an offence
against s. 4 of the Act of 1850 is an offence within the meaning of s. 19 of
the Act of 1853.

This case was followed in the case of Hart v.
Hudson[11], and is accepted
by all of the text books as stating the law.

Another argument was also put forward, which is
best stated in the language of Mr. Justice St. Germain as follows:

Le Parlement a donc délégué tous ses
pouvoirs au gouverneur en conseil pour la mise en exécution des arrêtés ministériels
passés en vertu de la dite loi, sauf la restriction ci-dessus quant à la peine,
et il appartenait par conséquent au gouverneur en conseil de mentionner dans le
décret en vertu duquel l'intimé a été mis en accusation que quiconque
contreviendrait à ce décret serait sujet à telle peine fixée par le dit décret;
bien plus, il appartenait aussi au gouverneur en conseil de déclarer que les
peines qui seraient imposées pour infractions aux arrêtés et règlements établis
sous la dite loi seraient ainsi imposées, soit après déclaration sommaire de
culpabilité ""upon summary conviction"", ou soit par voie de mise en
accusation ""upon indictment.""

It seems to me, however, that article 164  of the
Criminal Code  was passed for the very purpose of providing for cases where
penalties were not otherwise imposed by the law, and applies to violation of
the provisions of such orders as form part of the law authorized by a statute,
as in this case.

With all respect to those who take a different
view, I agree with the views of Mr. Justice Barclay and Mr. Justice Francœur in
the court below, and would allow the appeal.

[Page 123]

Taschereau J.—The respondent, a druggist, was acquitted by Mr. Justice Guérin,
of Montreal, of the charge of having without lawful excuse disobeyed an Act of
Parliament for which no penalty is expressly provided, to wit, paragraph (2) of
Regulations, dated the 11th day of September, 1939, of the War Measures Act,
by wilfully selling codeine, a narcotic drug, without first having obtained
a written order or prescription signed and dated by a physician, thus,
committing an offence against section 164  of the Criminal Code .

The Court of King's Bench of the province of Quebec (Barclay and Francœur
JJ. dissenting) affirmed the judgment of the trial judge and the Crown has
appealed to this Court.

The reason given by the trial judge, and the
Court of King's Bench, is that there is an offence under section 164  of the
Criminal Code , only when the Act complained of is forbidden by an Act of the
Parliament of Canada, or of any legislature of Canada, and that a regulation
passed under the War Measures Act, is not an Act of Parliament. Section
164 of the Code reads as follows:

164. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who, without lawful excuse,
disobeys any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of any legislature in Canada,
by wilfully doing any act which it forbids, or omitting to do any act which it
requires to be done, unless some penalty or other mode of punishment is
expressly provided by law.

Section (3) of the War Measures Act confers
special powers to the Governor General in Council and amongst other things
says:—

The Governor in Council may do and
authorize such Acts and things and make from time to time such orders and
regulations as he may, by reason of real or apprehended war, invasion or
insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, order and
welfare of Canada.

The same section has also the following
provisions:—

All orders and regulations made under this
section shall have the force of law and shall be enforced in such manner and by
such courts, officers and authorities as the Governor in Council may prescribe,
and may be varied, extended or revoked by any subsequent order or regulation.

Section 4 of the same Act empowers the Governor
in Council to

[Page 124]

prescribe the penalties that may be imposed
for violations of orders and regulations made under this Act, and (to) also
prescribe whether such penalties shall be imposed upon summary conviction or
upon indictment, but no such penalty shall exceed a fine of five thousand
dollars or imprisonment for any term not exceeding five years, or both fine and
imprisonment.

Pursuant to these powers given by Parliament,
the Governor General in Council passed regulations forbidding the sale of
codeine without a written prescription signed by a physician, but these
regulations do not contain any provisions for a penalty.

It is beyond all dispute that Parliament has
power to authorize the making of such regulations. The only question is whether
the Order in Council can be interpreted as meaning an Act of Parliament. There
is no doubt that all orders and regulations made under section 3 of the War
Measures Act have the force of law, and may be enforced as the Governor
General may prescribe, but, can it be said that a disobedience to the Order in
Council is a disobedience to the statute itself?

It has been submitted by the Crown that an Order
in Council issued in virtue of the War Measures Act becomes an integral
part of the Act and that a violation of the Order in Council is a violation of
the War Measures Act itself, and, therefore, of an Act of Parliament.

The War Measures Act does not, like other
Acts enacted by the Parliament of Canada, provide that the regulations passed
by the Governor General in Council shall form part of the Act nor does it say
that every offence against such regulations shall be considered as a violation
of the Act. Such provisions may be found in the Bankruptcy Act, the Explosives
Act , the Fisheries Act, etc., but nothing of the kind is
incorporated in the War Measures Act, and we find no provisions
analogous to those which are in the Acts above mentioned.

I cannot come to the conclusion that in the
present instance the violation of the Order in Council is tantamount to the
violation of the War Measures Act. An Order in Council is passed by the
Executive Council, and an Act of Parliament is enacted by the House of Commons
and by the Senate of Canada. Both are entirely different, and unless there is a
provision in the law stating that the Orders in Council shall be considered as
forming part of the law itself, or that any offence against the regulations

[Page 125]

shall be a violation of the Act, it cannot be
said that the violation of an Order in Council is a violation of an Act of Parliament
within the meaning of section 164  of the Criminal Code .

Furthermore, the word ""Act"" is defined
in the Criminal Code  as follows:—

Section 2 , paragraph (1) :

""any Act,"" or ""any other
Act,"" includes any Act passed or to be passed by the Parliament of Canada,
or any Act passed by the legislature of the late Province of Canada, or passed
or to be passed by the legislature of any province of Canada, or passed
by the legislature of any province now a part of Canada before it was included
therein.

It is to my judgment impossible to stretch the
meaning of the word ""Act"" to such an extent so as to include an Order
in Council.

I would, therefore, dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF
 ALBERTA

Criminal law—Appeal—Cr. Code, ss. 951(3), 285(6), 1023(2)—Accused
charged with manslaughter—Charge arising out of operation of motor vehicle—At
trial accused found not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of driving in a
manner dangerous to the public—Appeal by Attorney-General of the province
dismissed by appellate court (with a dissent on questions of law)—Appeal by
Attorney-General to Supreme Court of Canada—Jurisdiction—Whether there was a
""judgment or verdict, of acquittal"" within s. 1028(2)—Merits—Evidence
and findings at trial.

[Page 53]

Accused was charged with manslaughter. The charge arose out of
the operation of a motor vehicle. The trial judge (sitting without a jury, as
permitted by statute applicable to the province) found accused not guilty of
manslaughter but, as provided for by s. 951(3) of the Cr. Code (as
amended in 1938, c. 44, s.. 45), found him guilty of driving in a manner
dangerous to the public, under s. 285(6) of the Cr. Code (as amended ibid,
s. 16). The Attorney-General for Alberta appealed, asking that the
""judgment or verdict of acquittal"" at trial on the charge of
manslaughter ""be set aside and a conviction made in lieu thereof"" or
that, in the alternative, there be a new trial of accused upon said charge. The
appeal was dismissed by the Appellate Division, Alta., (Harvey, C.J.,
dissenting on questions of law), [1940] 2 W.W.R. 401. The Attorney-General
appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Rinfret, Crocket, Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.: The
appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction.

Rinfret J.: Neither of the conditions of a right of appeal to
this Court under s. 1023(2) of the Cr. Code (as amended in 1935, c. 56,
s. 16) exists; the Appellate Division did not ""set aside a
conviction"" nor ""dismiss an appeal against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal."" The judgment at trial was not an acquittal; it was a
conviction upon the charge as laid, in accordance with s. 951(3) which
indicates that a conviction under s. 285(6) may be the result of a charge of
manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. Further, (the
right of appeal of an Attorney General of a province under s. 1023(2), as it
was only recently given and as criminal statutes should always be construed
favourably to the accused, should not be extended beyond the strict terms of
the Code.

Per Crocket J.: The judgment of the Appellate Division
did not fall within the terms of s. 1023(2). The clear intendment of s. 951(3)
is that a charge of manslaughter which arises out of the operation of a motor
vehicle must be taken to include the offence described

[Page 54]

in s. 285(6) and that the trial tribunal shall have the right,
instead of convicting of manslaughter, to find accused guilty, on the
manslaughter charge, of the lesser offence. This having been done, it cannot be
said that there was ""a judgment or verdict of acquittal"" in respect
of the charge on which accused was tried.

Per Kerwin J.: Though accused was acquitted of the
charge of manslaughter, yet it cannot be said that the judgment at trial was
""a judgment or verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable
offence"" within the meaning of s. 1023(2) so as to give this Court
jurisdiction, particularly in view of the results which otherwise might follow
(as set out infra, per Taschereau J.).

Per Taschereau J.: A charge of manslaughter arising out
of the operation of a motor vehicle includes, by operation of s. 951(3), a
charge under s. 285(6), though the offence under 285(6) is not mentioned in the
count. When there is an acquittal on said major offence followed with a
conviction on said minor offence, it cannot be said that accused has been
acquitted on the charge as laid; the degree of his guilt is smaller, but
he has nevertheless been found guilty. For the purpose of the right of appeal
given by s. 1023(2), the word ""acquittal"" therein means a complete
acquittal in respect of all the offences charged directly or otherwise in the
same count. To hold otherwise would have the very extraordinary result that
this Court, entertaining the appeal, would undoubtedly have the power to direct
a new trial, as a result of which the accused, without having appealed, might
be acquitted even of the charge on which he has already been found guilty at
the first trial.

The Chief Justice, but for the above weighty concurrence of
opinion by four Judges of this Court against this Court's jurisdiction, would
have thought that the Appellate Division, Alta., was right in considering the
appeal on the merits. He expressed emphatically his opinion that, on a charge
such as that in the present case, a jury, having satisfied themselves that the
accused, in the language of s. 951(3), ""is not guilty of
manslaughter"" (which is a condition of their jurisdiction to find the
accused guilty of an offence under s. 285(6)), must pronounce a verdict to that
effect and that the accused is entitled to demand such pronouncement; and that
such a pronouncement is an acquittal of the accused upon the charge of manslaughter
under the indictment. Whether an appeal lies or not may, of course, be another
question.

Per Davis J.: The appeal should be dismissed on the
merits. On the evidence and the finding's at trial, it cannot be said that
accused killed the man with whose death he was charged by the indictment.

Per Hudson J.: The appeal should be dismissed on the
ground that the trial judge, on proper interpretation of his statements, found
that there was not sufficient evidence to satisfy him beyond reasonable doubt that
accused caused the death of the deceased and, as a consequence, found accused
not guilty of manslaughter.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General for Alberta from the judgment
of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1]
dismissing (Harvey, C.J., dissenting

[Page 55]

on questions of law) his appeal from
the judgment of Howson J. (sitting without a jury, as permitted by statute
applicable to the province) upon the trial of the accused, respondent, on the
charge that he ""did unlawfully cause the death of one, Charles W. Stout,
and did thereby commit manslaughter."" It appeared from the evidence and
the record that the charge arose out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The
trial judge found the accused not guilty of manslaughter but, as provided for by
s. 951(3)  of the Criminal Code  (as amended in 1938, c. 44, s. 45 ), found
him guilty of driving in a manner dangerous to the public under s. 285(6)  of
the Criminal Code  (as amended in 1938, c. 44, s. 16 ).

In his appeal to the Appellate Division, the Attorney-General
asked that the ""judgment or verdict of acquittal"" at trial on the
charge of manslaughter ""be set aside and a conviction made in lieu
thereof""; or that, in the alternative, there be a new trial of accused
upon the said charge. In his appeal to this Court the Attorney-General asked
for an order setting aside the judgment of the Appellate Division ""and
directing that a verdict or judgment of guilty of manslaughter be entered
against"" accused""in lieu of said verdict of acquittal and the
appropriate punishment imposed or in the alternative an order directing a new
trial or such other order as may be proper.""

On the hearing before this Court the question was raised
whether there had been a ""judgment or verdict of acquittal"" within
the meaning of s. 1023(2)  of the Criminal Code  (as amended in 1935, c.
56, s. 16 ) so as to give jurisdiction to hear the present appeal; and argument
was heard on this point as well as argument on the merits of the appeal.

H. J. Wilson K.C. and W. S. Gray K.C. for the
appellant.

E. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The majority of the Court have come to
the conclusion that no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada in this case
under section 1023(2) . But for the weighty concurrence of opinion on this point
by four judges of this Court, I should have thought that the Court of Appeal
for Alberta was right in considering the

[Page 56]

appeal on the merits. I do not further
pursue the discussion of the question whether an appeal to this Court arises
under section 1023(2) .

I am concerned to emphasize one point. Before proceeding to that
point it may be as well to note in passing that Mr. Wilson, on behalf of the
Attorney-General for Alberta, contended that the proceedings in the trial did
not disclose a charge of ""manslaughter arising out of the operation of a
motor vehicle"" and, consequently, that the case did not fall within
section 951.

I say nothing about this point. The point I desire to insist upon
is this: The enactment under consideration, section 951 , subsection 3 , provides
in the most explicit way that it is a condition of the jurisdiction of the jury
to find the accused guilty of an offence under subsection 6  of section 285 that
they shall be ""satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter.""
In the present case the accused was charged with manslaughter simpliciter. I
can have no doubt that the jury, having satisfied themselves that the accused,
in the language of the section, ""is not guilty of manslaughter,"" must
pronounce a verdict to that effect and that the accused is entitled to demand
such pronouncement. Nor have I any doubt that such a pronouncement is an
acquittal of the accused upon the charge of manslaughter under the indictment.
Whether an appeal lies or not may, of course, be another question.

RINFRET J.—I am of opinion that this appeal must be
quashed for want of jurisdiction in this Court.

The appeal is asserted by the Attorney-General of the province of
Alberta against the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
that province, which affirmed the judgment of Howson, J., finding the respondent guilty ""of driving to the
public danger,"" under sec. 285, subs. 6, of the Criminal Code .

The charge laid against the respondent was that he ""did
unlawfully cause the death of one, Charles W. Stout, and did thereby commit
manslaughter""; and it appears from the evidence and the record that such
charge of manslaughter arose out of the operation of a motor vehicle.

Upon that charge, the trial judge, being satisfied that the
accused was not guilty of manslaughter, but was guilty

[Page 57]

of an offence under subs. 6 of sec. 285
above mentioned, found him (as he could do under subs. 3 of s. 951  of the Criminal
Code ) guilty of the lesser offence.

The case was then carried to the Appellate Division of Alberta by
the Attorney-General, apparently taking advantage of subs. 4 of sec. 1013 of
the Code, by force of which

the Attorney-General shall have the
right to appeal to the court of appeal against any judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in respect of an indictable offence on any ground of
appeal which involves a question of law alone.

The Court of Appeal merely confirmed the judgment condemning the
respondent. It is not necessary to consider whether the right of appeal in this
particular case was competently asserted before that Court.

The Attorney-General then appealed from the two concurrent
judgments to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Now, the right of the Attorney-General of the province to appeal
to this Court, in a case such as this, is regulated by subs. 2 of sec. 1023 of
the Code. Under that subsection, the Attorney-General may appeal to this Court
only

from the judgment of any court of
appeal setting aside a conviction or dismissing an appeal against a judgment or
verdict of acquittal in respect of an indictable offence on an appeal taken
under section ten hundred and thirteen on any question of law on which there
has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.

It is, therefore, apparent that the right of appeal by the
Attorney-General under the above subsection is strictly dependent upon the
existence of one of two conditions: Either a judgment of the Court of Appeal
setting aside a conviction; or a judgment of a Court of Appeal dismissing an
appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal.

Neither of these conditions exists here.

The conviction against the respondent has not been set aside but,
on the contrary, it was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

Nor was there a dismissal of an appeal against a judgment or
verdict of acquittal.

The respondent was not acquitted either by the trial judge or by
the Court of Appeal.

When the informer laid his charge against the respondent, and
upon the charge as laid, he was praying, no doubt, for a conviction of
manslaughter; but he was also praying, in the alternative, by force of subs. 3
of sec. 951 , for a conviction of an offence under subs. 6 of sec. 285.

[Page 58]

And, as a matter of fact, he got the
alternative condemnation, or, in other words, he got one of the two things that
he had been asking for. Upon the charge as laid, and upon that alone, the
respondent was not acquitted, but he was found guilty of having driven his
motor vehicle on a highway in a manner which was dangerous to the public, in
accordance with the provisions of subsection 6  of sec. 285. There has been no
judgment of acquittal, either by the trial judge or by the Court of Appeal,
from which it was open to the Attorney-General to bring an appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada,

Subs. 3 of sec. 951  of the Criminal Code  was introduced in
1930 by ch. 11, sec. 25, of the Statutes of Canada of that year, though in a
different form.

The amendment thus introduced stated in terms that

Upon a charge of manslaughter
arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle the jury may find the accused
not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of criminal negligence under section two
hundred and eighty-four, and such conviction shall be a bar to further
prosecution for any offence arising out of the same facts.

Later, in the amendment so made, sec 285(6) was substituted for
sec. 284.

As a result, the situation in the present case, it seems to me,
was as follows:

The accident happened. It was a single occurrence. There was only
one set of facts. The informer laid his charge and therein described the
occurrence as a manslaughter, without more. But I cannot close my eyes to the
fact that, upon the evidence and the record, it was, if at all, a
""manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle."" This,
to my mind, brought the charge within the terms of subs. 3 of s. 951  of the Criminal
Code .

After having heard the witnesses, the trial judge was
""satisfied that the accused was not guilty of manslaughter but was guilty
of an offence under subsection six of section two hundred and
eighty-five."" By force of section 951(3) of the Code, the trial judge
could then find the accused guilty of the lesser offence. And that is what he
did. Parliament itself indicates in that subsection that a conviction under
subs. 6 of s. 285 may be the result of a charge of manslaughter arising out of
the operation of a motor vehicle. The trial judge could find the accused guilty
of

[Page 59]

the lesser offence upon the charge as
laid, as a consequence of that single occurrence and upon the evidence of the
single set of facts leading to it. By the will of Parliament as expressed in
sec. 951(3) , the conviction for the lesser offence was one of the two
convictions which the trial judge had the power to make. The judgment of the
trial judge, therefore, cannot be styled an acquittal within the meaning of s.
1023(2)  of the Criminal Code . It was, and it is, a conviction upon the
charge as laid, in accordance with the provisions of sec. 951(3) . By the very
terms of that subsection, ""such conviction shall be a bar to further
prosecution for any offence arising out of the same facts."" As a
consequence of that provision of the Code, should the accused be later
confronted with a charge of manslaughter based upon the same occurrence, he
could plead autrefois convict; and that plea would have to be maintained
upon the plain terms of that section of the Code.

The respondent has, therefore, been convicted upon the charge as
laid; and I cannot look upon the judgment now submitted to our Court as being
an acquittal in the sense that it may give the Attorney-General a right of
appeal to this Court under the provisions of subs. 2 of s. 1023.

In connection with the above, one must recall that it is only
recently that the Attorney-General of a province was given the right of appeal
under sec 1023; and, both on that account and because criminal statutes should
always be construed favourably to the accused, I do not think the right of
appeal of the Attorney-General should be extended beyond the strict terms of
the Code.

It follows that the present appeal was not competently asserted
and that this Court is lacking of the jurisdiction required to entertain the
appeal.

Under these circumstances, the appeal must be quashed.

CROCKET J.—The accused was tried on an indictment for the
single offence of manslaughter before Mr. Justice Howson. Such an indictment
may be tried in Alberta without a jury, if the accused so elects, under certain
unrepealed provisions of the old North West Territories Act still in
force in that province.

S. 951 , subs. 3, of the Criminal Code  provides that:

Upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation
of a motor vehicle the jury, if they are satisfied that the accused is not
guilty

[Page 60]

of manslaughter but is guilty of an
offence under subsection 6 of section. 285, may find him guilty of that
offence, and such conviction shall be a bar to further prosecution for any
offence arising out of the same facts.

It is not questioned that this enactment applies to a trial
before a Supreme Court Judge in Alberta sitting without a jury, or that the
manslaughter charge in the present case arose out of the operation of a motor
vehicle. The trial judge specifically found the accused guilty of driving an
automobile in a manner dangerous to the public contrary to the provisions of s.
285(6) , and not guilty of manslaughter.

The Attorney-General appealed to the Court of Appeal, which
merely confirmed the conviction, the Chief"" Justice dissenting, and this
is the judgment which it is now sought to challenge in this Court under the
provisions of s. 1023(2)  of the Criminal Code  on the point or points of
law raised in the dissenting opinion of the learned Chief Justice.

It was contended by counsel for the accused that the judgment of
the Court of Appeal does not fall within the terms of subs. 2 of s. 1023 of the
Code and that no appeal therefore lies to this Court.

I think this objection is well taken. This Court is authorized by
the subsection to hear an appeal at the instance of the Attorney-General of a
Province from the judgment of a provincial Court of Appeal only if the judgment
is one which sets aside a conviction or dismisses ""an appeal against a
judgment or verdict of acquittal in: respect of an indictable offence.""
That such conviction, or judgment or verdict of acquittal, as the case may be,
must necessarily be upon the charge or indictment upon which the accused has
been tried by the trial court, is obvious, for assuredly no accused person
could either be convicted or acquitted ""in respect of"" any indictable
offence which was not included in the charge or indictment to which he was
required to plead. The clear intendment of s. 951(3) , to my mind, is that a
charge of manslaughter which arises out of the operation of a motor vehicle
must be taken to include the offence of driving a motor vehicle on a street,
road, highway or other public place recklessly or in a manner which is
dangerous to the public, as described in s. 285(6)  of the Criminal Code , and
that the trial tribunal shall have the right, instead

[Page 61]

of convicting the accused of the
principal offence of manslaughter, to find him guilty upon that charge of the
lesser offence against s. 285(6) . This is what the trial judge did in the
present case, he being satisfied that the accused was not guilty of
manslaughter, but was guilty under the manslaughter indictment of the latter
offence. The learned judge certainly could not have convicted the accused,
under the indictment he was trying, of both manslaughter and an offence against
s. 285(6) . He could only find him guilty of one or the other, and having found
him guilty of the lesser offence, it cannot, in my judgment, rightly be said
that there was ""a judgment or verdict of acquittal"" in respect of the
charge upon which the accused was tried; otherwise his conviction for the
subordinate offence would not be a bar to his further prosecution for
manslaughter or any other offence arising out of the same facts, as the last
clause of s. 951(3)  explicitly provides it shall be.

For these reasons I am
of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal does not fall within the
ambit of s. 1023(2)  and that this appeal therefrom should be quashed for want
of jurisdiction.

DAVIS J.—The question of the jurisdiction of this Court to
entertain the appeal of the Attorney-General of Alberta, turning on the point
of some nicety as to whether or not there was an ""acquittal"" within
the meaning of sec. 1023(2)  of the Criminal Code  in that while the
accused was found not guilty of the charge of manslaughter laid in the
indictment he was found guilty under sec. 285(6)
of the lesser offence of driving his motor car to the public danger, was
raised by a member of the Court during the argument of the merits of the
appeal. I am not prepared,
without a full and considered argument of a point of such importance and
widespread effect, to dispose of the difficult question involved. Suffice it to
say that at present I have much
doubt as to the objection to jurisdiction but, in my view of the appeal, it
becomes unnecessary to determine the point.

I would dismiss the
appeal on the merits. Too much emphasis has been put in this case, I think, upon the difficulties of
definition of the crime of manslaughter in running-down cases. Andrews v.
Director of Public Prosecutions[2]. The
first and fundamental question, not

[Page 62]

touched by such difficulties, is whether
or not the accused killed the unfortunate man with whose death he is charged by
the indictment. That is a question of fact. Upon the evidence it is plain that
the accused was driving his motor car in an easterly direction up a hill on a
public highway in the suburb of Alberta Park, near the city of Calgary. It was
about eight o'clock on a clear evening, May 30th, 1939. The trial judge found
as a fact that the accused was travelling at a moderate rate of speed. On going
up the hill the accused had run over the centre line but the trial judge found
that the car was only ""a little north"" of the centre line—""a
small amount—"" somewhat but not greatly"" on the north side of the
centre line. The deceased, a man within a few days of his 67th birthday, was at
the same time riding a bicycle along the highway in the opposite direction. He
was carrying empty beer bottles, which it had been his custom to collect and
sell for a living, in a pasteboard box placed in a metal basket which was
fastened to his bicycle in front of the handlebars. The accused said that when
he saw the man on the bicycle come over the hill the bicycle was swerving along
the road and that he, the accused, applied his brakes. Hodges, an eye witness
called by the Crown, testified that the motor car ""was either actually
stopped or practically stopped at the moment of the impact."" The trial
judge found that the man on the bicycle swerved or wavered on his bicycle into
the left-hand front corner of the motor car. The left front headlight of the
motor car was broken and the windshield of the car was caved in. The
unfortunate man died shortly thereafter from hemorrhage of the brain due to a
fractured skull, and the driver of the motor car was charged with manslaughter.

The accused was tried by a judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
without a jury, as permitted by the North West Territories Act of 1886
made applicable by the Alberta Criminal Procedure Act, 1930, Dom., ch.
12. The trial judge found the accused was not guilty of manslaughter and the
Court of Appeal of Alberta affirmed that judgment, Harvey, C.J., dissenting.

There was evidence that the accused was under the influence of
liquor at the time and on that evidence the learned trial judge found him
guilty under sec. 285(6) of the lesser offence of driving his car to ""the
public danger. No appeal was taken from that conviction.

[Page 63]

In my opinion, it cannot be said on the evidence and the findings
that the accused killed the man on the bicycle, and on that ground I should
dismiss the appeal.

KERWIN J.—I thought, and still think, that the accused was
acquitted of the charge of manslaughter. I was at first inclined to the view
that we had jurisdiction. Further consideration, however, and particularly the
results (set out in the judgment of my brother Taschereau) that would follow
from a decision that this Court had jurisdiction have now convinced me that
this was not ""a judgment or verdict of acquittal in respect of an
indictable offence"" within the meaning of subsection 2  of section 1023  of
the Criminal Code . I would therefore dismiss the appeal for want of
jurisdiction.

HUDSON J.—As I interpret the remarks of the learned
trial judge, he found that there was not sufficient evidence to satisfy him
beyond reasonable doubt that the accused caused the death of the deceased and,
as a consequence, found the accused not guilty of manslaughter.

On this ground, I would dismiss the appeal.

I am inclined to agree that this Court has no jurisdiction, but
as the question was raised only by a member of the Court during the argument, I
would prefer to leave it open for further discussion.

TASCHEREAU J.—On the 27th of November, 1939, the
respondent, Harry Wilmot, was charged before Mr. Justice Howson of the Supreme
Court of Alberta of having unlawfully caused by the operation of a motor
vehicle the death of Charles W. Stout, thereby committing the crime of
manslaughter. In a very elaborate judgment, the trial judge found the accused
not guilty of manslaughter, but found him guilty of driving in a manner
dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.

The section of the Criminal Code  which authorizes the jury
to find the accused guilty of the lesser offence reads as follows:—

951.(3) Upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the
operation of a motor vehicle the jury, if they are satisfied that the accused
is not guilty of manslaughter but is guilty of an offence under subsection six
of section two hundred and eighty-five may find him guilty of that offence, and
such conviction shall be a bar to further prosecution for any offence arising
out of the same facts.

[Page 64]

Section 285(6)  says:—

Every one who drives a motor vehicle on a street, road,
highway or other public place recklessly, or in a manner which is dangerous to
the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the
nature, condition, and use of the street, road, highway or place, and the
amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected
to be, on such street, road, highway or place, shall be guilty of an offence
and liable * * *

The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal for Alberta and the
judgment was affirmed, Chief Justice Harvey dissenting on a question of law.
The Attorney-General of Alberta now appeals to this Court and submits that in
law, the respondent should not have been convicted of the lesser offence
mentioned in section 285(6)  but of manslaughter.

During the argument the question of jurisdiction of the Court was
raised. The right given to the Attorney-General of a province to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada is found in section 1023(2)  of the Criminal Code  which
is in the following terms:—

(2) The Attorney-General of the province may appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of appeal setting aside
a conviction or dismissing an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal
in respect of an indictable offence on an appeal taken under section ten
hundred and thirteen on any question of law on which there has been dissent in
the Court of Appeal.

The law strictly limits the rights of the Attorney-General to
appeal and they can be summarized as follows:

The Attorney-General may appeal:

1. From the judgment of a court of appeal setting aside a
conviction;

2. From the judgment of a court of appeal dismissing an appeal
against a verdict of acquittal.

It is, therefore, only when the accused has been acquitted that
the Crown may appeal to this Court. In the present case, the accused has been
acquitted of the charge of manslaughter, but he has been found guilty under
section 285(6) of the offence of driving an automobile in a manner dangerous to
the public, and this conviction has been affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

Upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a
motor vehicle, three verdicts may be rendered: 10. guilty of manslaughter, 20.
guilty under section 285(6) , and
30 . not guilty.

[Page 65]

The power of the Court to convict of a lesser offence upon a
charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle, was
originally given in 1930, when it was said that the accused could be found
guilty of, criminal negligence under section 284, Cr. C. In 1938 (Chap.
44, section 45) the law was amended, and we now have section 951(3) , Cr. C.,
which clearly says that the lesser offence on a charge of manslaughter
arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle is the offence found in section
285(6) .

By the operation of the law, the lesser offence is included in
the count, and a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor
vehicle, therefore, includes a charge under section 285(6) , although this last
offence is not mentioned in the count. When there is an acquittal on the major
offence followed with a conviction on the minor offence, it cannot be said that
the accused has been acquitted on the charge as laid. The degree of his
guilt is smaller, but he has nevertheless been found guilty.

To my mind, the law requires a complete acquittal in respect of
all the offences charged directly or otherwise in the same count, in order to
allow the Attorney-General to appeal to this Court.

To hold different views would, in my opinion, lead us to a very
extraordinary result. This Court, if it did come to the conclusion that it has
jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, would undoubtedly have the power to
direct a new trial, and as a result of which the accused, without having
appealed, might be acquitted, even of the charge on which he has already been
found guilty at the first trial.

I, therefore, have to come to the conclusion that the respondent
has not been acquitted within the meaning of section 1023(2) , that this Court
has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal, and that it should be quashed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Evidence—Charge of receiving
stolen goods—Explanation by accused—Good faith—Lack of knowledge of goods being
stolen— Whether explanation by accused is a reasonable one—Discharge by the Crown
as to onus of proving accused’s guilt—Duty of trial judge.

The appellant was charged with the offence of
receiving stolen goods and was found guilty. At the trial, the appellant and
some other witnesses were heard in support of appellant’s explanation that he
had bought these goods in good faith and without any knowledge that

 [Page 102]

they were stolen effects. The appellant
appealed to the appellate court on the ground that his explanation was a
reasonable one, that the Crown had failed to discharge the onus of proving
beyond a reasonable doubt the accused’s guilt and that the explanation was
equally plausible as to his innocence or to guilt. The majority of the
appellate court affirmed the conviction, one judge dissenting on the ground
that there was no evidence upon which the appellant could be convicted.

Held, that the
appeal should be dismissed. The question to which it was the duty of the trial
judge to apply his mind was not whether he was convinced that the explanation
given was the true explanation, but whether the explanation might reasonably be
true; or, in other words, whether the Crown had discharged the onus of
satisfying the trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the explanation of
the appellant could not be accepted as a reasonable one and that he was
guilty.—Rex v. Schama (11 C.A.R. 45); Rex v. Searle (51
C.C.C. 128) and Re Ketteringham (19 C.C.C. 159) ref. and app.— Under all
the circumstances of the case, it cannot be held that there was no evidence
that the explanation offered by the appellant was one that the trial judge
might not find could not reasonably be accepted as true.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming (Pratte
(ad hoc) J. dissenting) the conviction of
the appellant for the offence, under section 399  of the Criminal Code , of
receiving or retaining in his possession stolen goods knowing them to be
stolen. By the judgment now reported the appeal to this Court was dismissed.

Lucien H. Gendron
K.C. for the appellant.

John Crankshaw K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Rinfret,
Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—The proper direction on the trial of an
accused charged under section 399  of the Criminal Code  with receiving or
retaining in his possession stolen goods, knowing them to be stolen, is
explained in three judgments to which our attention was called by Mr. Gendron.

In the Schama case[1], the Lord Chief Justice explained the rule
as follows:—

Where the prisoner is charged with
receiving recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the
possession by the prisoner, and that

[Page 103]

the goods had been recently stolen, the
jury should be told that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any
reasonable explanation, find the prisoner guilty. But if an explanation is
given which may be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence whether the accused is guilty or not; that is
to say, if the jury think that the explanation may reasonably be true, though
they are not convinced that it is true, the prisoner is entitled to an
acquittal, because the Crown has not discharged the onus of proof imposed upon
it of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the prisoner’s guilt.

This passage was applied by the Appellate
Division of Alberta in a judgment delivered by Harvey C.J. in Rex v. Searle[2].

In the Ketteringham case[3], Avory J. said:

The question which should have been left to
the jury was simply: “Did the appellant receive the goods in such circumstances
that he must then have known them to have been stolen?” The question, however,
which was left was whether the jury thought that the account given by the
appellant’s son in evidence of the manner in which he became possessed of the
goods could be accepted. The jury should have been told not only that they
could acquit, but that they ought to acquit, the appellant if they were
satisfied that his explanation was consistent with his innocence.

The question, therefore, to which it was the
duty of the learned trial judge to apply his mind was not whether he was
convinced that the explanation given was the true explanation, but whether the
explanation might reasonably be true; or, to put it in other words, whether the
Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the learned trial judge beyond a
reasonable doubt that the explanation of the accused could not be accepted as a
reasonable one and that he was guilty.

The dissenting judge did not put his dissent on
the ground that the trial judge had misdirected himself on any point of law, or
that he had not applied his mind to the precise question which it was his duty,
as indicated in what has just been said, to determine. He dissented on the
ground that there was no evidence upon which the accused could be convicted and
I assume that to mean that there was in point of law no evidence to support a
verdict of guilty. After considering all the circumstances, I am unable to
agree with this view; in other words, I am not satisfied that there is no
evidence that the explanation

[Page 104]

offered was one that the trial judge might not
find could not reasonably be accepted as true.

The appeal must be dismissed.

Cannon, J.—I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Champerty—Maintenance—Officious
or improper interventions—Stirring up of strife—Elements necessary to
constitute these crimes.

The appellant was convicted of maintenance
and champerty and fined five hundred dollars; and the conviction was affirmed
by a majority of the appellate court. The facts of the case are undisputed, the
accused having called no evidence. One Lallemand was injured and incapacitated
for a considerable period. He did not know the name of a single witness who
could strengthen any claim he might make against the Montreal Tramways Company,
the party he considered responsible for his injury; and for that reason, his
attorneys could not advise action. Some time later, Lallemand’s wife approached
the appellant, who undertook to search for those who might have seen the
accident. Lallemand and his wife having no money to pay the appellant for his
services, it was agreed that the amount and settlement of his remuneration should
await the conclusion of the litigation; but there was no bargain that he should
receive a share of the proceeds. Then Lallemand himself chose and retained an
attorney, who commenced and continued an action against the Montreal Tramways
Company without any contribution from Lallemand or the appellant towards the
expenses. In the meantime, however, the appellant had discovered certain
witnesses whose testimony was made available to Lallemand’s attorney. The
action was finally settled upon payment of $6,000 by the company to the
attorney. At Lallemand’s direction, the expenses were paid out of that sum,
including the amount at which the appellant’s account was finally fixed.

[Page 447]

Held, that,
under these circumstances, the appellant was not guilty of the criminal offence
of maintenance. In order to make a person liable as a maintainer, either
civilly or criminally, that person must have intervened officiously or
improperly. There must exist officious interference, introduction of parties to
enforce rights which others are not disposed to enforce and stirring up of
strife. In this case, Lallemand was disposed to enforce his claim, and in fact
had already consulted attorneys before his wife approached the appellant; and
the appellant did not intervene on his own initiative and took no action that
may be in any way described as stirring up strife and litigation.

Held, also,
that the appellant could not be convicted of the crime of champerty, as he did
not carry on the litigation at his own expense nor did he bargain for a share
of the proceeds.

Review of cases and text books on
“maintenance.”

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming by a majority the
judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace by which the appellant had been
convicted of maintenance and champerty and fined five hundred dollars.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment
now reported.

Gustave Monette K.C. for the appellant.

Ivan Sabourin for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of
Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by

Kerwin J.—The appellant Goodman was convicted of maintenance and champerty
by the Court of Sessions of the Peace and fined five hundred dollars. Upon
appeal to the Court of King’s Bench, the conviction was affirmed but, as
appears from the formal judgment of the Court

Mr. Justice Bernier and Mr. Justice Hall
dissent on the ground that the appellant, having been approached by the
victim’s wife and commissioned by her to discover the names and addresses of
the witnesses required for the successsful prosecution of the proposed
litigation, his participation therein was neither officious nor unlawful, and
the fact that he consented to allow the payment for his: services to await the
outcome of the action does not amount to maintenance.

Based upon that dissent Goodman now appeals.

While a considerable part of the factum for the
respondent deals with the submission that no question of law is involved, it
also appears from the factum and we understood from counsel at bar that the
contention really

[Page 448]

is that the appeal must be confined to the
question as to whether the facts adduced in evidence by the Crown (and the
inferences to be drawn therefrom) did amount to maintenance or champerty. Such
a question is clearly one of law.

There is no dispute about the facts, which are
few and which were testified to by witnesses on behalf of the Crown,—the
accused calling no evidence; and there is likewise no dispute about the
inferences. It appears that one Lallemand was injured and incapacitated for a
considerable period. He did not know the name of a single witness who could
strengthen any claim he might make against the Montreal Tramways Company,—the
party he considered responsible for his injury. He consulted attorneys who,
because of the lack of evidence, could not advise action. Some time later
Lallemand’s wife approached the appellant, who undertook to search for those
who might have seen the accident. It was perfectly well known that Lallemand
and his wife had no money to pay the appellant for his services and it was
agreed that the amount and settlement of his remuneration should await the
conclusion of the litigation. There was no bargain that he should receive a
share of the proceeds.

Lallemand chose and retained an attorney, who
commenced and continued an action against Montreal Tramways Company without any
contribution from Lallemand or the appellant towards the expenses. In the
meantime, however, the appellant had discovered certain witnesses whose
testimony was made available to the attorney. The action was finally settled
upon payment of six thousand dollars by the Tramways Company to the attorney.
At Lallemand’s direction, the expenses were paid out of this sum, including the
amount at which the appellant’s account was finally fixed.

Under these circumstances it is needless to
refer to the various definitions of champerty since it is clear that the
appellant did not carry on the litigation at his own expense nor did he bargain
for a share of the proceeds. Champerty, although of greater atrocity, is an
offence similar to that of maintenance and it is, therefore, necessary to
determine what constitutes that crime.

A convenient starting point for that
investigation is the first edition of Chitty’s Criminal Law, 1816, vol. 2,

[Page 449]

p. 234, where in a note to a precedent of an
indictment for maintenance, the author, quoting Blackstone and Hawkins, states
that,—

Maintenance signifies a malicious, or at
least officious, interference in a pursuit in which the party has no interest
to assist either with money or advice to prosecute or defend the action.

Blackstone’s statement had been based upon
Hawkins’ Pleas of the Crown, the first edition of which appeared about 1716. In
the eighth edition the principle upon which the law against maintenance is
based is thus stated (Vol. 1, cap. 27, s. 38):—

It seemeth, that all maintenance is
strictly prohibited by the common law, as having a manifest tendency to
oppression, by encouraging and assisting persons to persist in suits, which
perhaps they would not venture to go on in upon their own bottoms.

Shortly after the publication of the eighth
edition of Hawkins appeared Chancellor Kent’s Commentaries on American Law.
Kent adopted Blackstone’s definition (which, as we have seen, was founded upon
Hawkins). At p. 447 of volume 4 of the 12th edition, it is stated that the
statutes of Edward I and Edward III against champerty and maintenance

were founded upon a principle common to the
laws of all well governed countries, that no encouragement should be given to
litigation, by the introduction of parties to enforce those rights which others
are not disposed to enforce.

Story on Contract, the first edition of which
appeared in 1844, is to the same effect:—

Maintenance is the officious assistance, by
money or otherwise, proposed by a third person to either party to a suit in
which he himself has no legal interest to enable him to prosecute or defend it.

In Prosser v. Edmonds[1], Lord Abinger puts the
matter in exactly the same way as it appears in Kent where he states:—

All our cases of maintenance and champerty
are founded on the principle that no encouragement should be given to
litigation by the introduction of parties to enforce those rights which others
are not disposed to enforce.

Lord Abinger’s statement is significant because
of the classical expression used by him in the later case of Findon v. Parker[2]:—

The law of maintenance as I understand it
upon the modern constructions, is confined to cases where a man improperly and
for the purpose of stirring up litigation and strife, encourages others either
to bring actions or to make defences which they have no right to make.

[Page 450]

This well-known passage assumes even greater
importance in connection with the present appeal. In Findon v. Parker[3] action was brought by a
solicitor for his costs, the defence being that the work was done pursuant to
an agreement and in circumstances amounting to maintenance. In order to
understand precisely the particular relevancy of the words quoted it is
necessary to reproduce the whole of Lord Abinger’s judgment in so far as it is
pertinent. He said:—

If any ground can be fairly suggested for
making this contract legal, we ought to adopt it in favour of the party who
makes the defence, in order to acquit him of the imputation that he casts upon
himself. The contract does not necessarily imply anything that the law calls
maintenance. The law of maintenance, as I understand it upon the modern
constructions, is confined to cases where a man improperly, and for the purpose
of stirring up litigation and strife, encourages others either to bring
actions, or to make defences which they have no right to make. I do not like to
give an opinion upon an abstract case, and therefore am not desirous to
consider it; but if a man were to see a poor person in the street oppressed and
abused, and without the means of obtaining redress, and furnish him with money
or employed an attorney to obtain redress for his wrongs, it would require a
very strong argument to convince me that that man could be said to be stirring
up litigation and strife, and to be guilty of the crime of maintenance; I am
not prepared to say, that, in modern times, Courts of Justice ought to come to
that conclusion. However, I give no opinion upon that point.

From this it will be observed that Lord Abinger
was discussing the crime of maintenance and while expressing no opinion, stated
his view that one ingredient of the crime must be “a stirring up” of litigation
and strife.

In Bradlaugh v. Newdegate[4], Lord Coleridge, while
determining that the passage quoted above had no application to the case before
him, stated that it was full of the strong sense characteristic of Lord Abinger
and he was inclined to agree with and adopt every word of it. Lord Coleridge
gives a number of definitions of maintenance, among which will be found those
of Kent and Story:—

There are many definitions of maintenance,
all seeming to express the same idea. Blackstone calls it “an officious
intermeddling in a suit which no way belongs to one by maintaining or assisting
either party with money or otherwise to prosecute or defend it”: B1. Comm. book
iv, c. 10, s. 12. “Maintenence,” says Lord Coke, “signifieth in law a taking in
hand, bearing up, or upholding of a quarrel, or side,

[Page 451]

to the disturbance or hindrance of common
right”: Co. Litt. 368 b. These definitions are repeated in substance in Bacon’s
abridgement, in Viner, and in Comyns, under the head of maintenance. To the
same effect, though somewhat differing in words, is the language of Lord Coke
in the 2nd Institute in his commentary on the Statute of Westminster the First,
c. xxviii. There is, perhaps, the fullest and completest of all to be found in
Termes de la Ley, “Maintenance is when any man gives or delivers to another
that is plaintiff or defendant in any action any sum of money or other thing to
maintain his plea, or takes great pains for him when he hath nothing therewith
to do; then the party grieved shall have a writ against him called a writ of
maintenance.” Chancellor Kent, adopting Blackstone’s definition, which
definition itself is founded on a passage in Hawkins, says that it is “a
principle common to the laws of all well governed countries that no
encouragement should be given to litigation by the introduction of parties to
enforce those rights which others are not disposed to enforce”: part vi, lect.
67. I quote from the excellent edition of Kent’s Commentaries, published by Mr.
O. W. Holmes at Boston in 1873. To the same effect is another American
authority, Mr. Story. “Maintenance is the officious assistance by money or
otherwise, proferred by a third person to either party to a suit, in which he
himself has no legal interest, to enable them to prosecute or defend it.”

In 1894, the case of Alabaster v. Harness[5] was decided by Mr. Justice
Hawkins. That; was an action for damages for the maintenance of an action for
libel, which latter action it was considered by the Court had not really been
brought by the plaintiff or at any rate had been brought at the instigation of
Harness and upon a promise of sustenance with respect to the costs of the
action. Hawkins, J., at p. 899, quotes the statement of the principle upon
which the law against maintenance is based, which appeared in Hawkins’ Pleas of
the Crown and which has already been set out, and also quotes Lord Abinger’s
statement of the principle in Prosser v. Edmonds[6]. In the Court of Appeal[7], Lord Justice Lopes, at p.
344, expressed his entire agreement with the judgment of Mr. Justice Hawkins in
the court below and repeated, with approval, Lord Abinger’s definition in Prosser
v. Edmonds6.

In British Cash and Parcel Conveyancors
Limited v. Lamson Store Service Company Limited[8], Cozens Hardy, Master of the
Rolls, after agreeing that there had been a time when what the defendants in
that action did would have been regarded as criminal, stated there was little
use in citing ancient text-books on the law of 

[Page 452]

maintenance. “The law,” (he continues) “has been
modified in accordance with modern ideas of propriety,” and he then proceeds to
quote the famous passage from Findon v. Parker13. At
page 1020, Lord Justice Buckley quotes the definitions of Kent and Story
mentioned above and also extracts from the judgments of Lord Abinger in Prosser
v. Edmonds[9]
and Findon v. Parker13.

In Scott v. The National System for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children[10],
Mr. Justice Bray, in referring at page 791 to certain bastardy proceedings, considered
the cases showed that it was immaterial what the result might be but that most
careful judge expressed the grounds of his decision on the point in the
following sentence: “It was the wanton intermeddling that was the cause of
action.”

In Oram v. Hutt10, Lord
Sumner at p. 107, in declining to agree with the contention that the
prosecutor’s defeat in a maintained action would be a defence to an indictment
for the misdemeanour of maintenance, states that it may be as much against
public interest to stir up an action which lies indeed but which never
would have been brought if the tort sufferer had been left to himself as to
maintain an action that does not lie at all.

Finally, the House of Lords considered the civil
action for maintenance in several aspects in Neville v. London
Express Newspaper Limited[11].
It was there held by Lord Finlay, Lord Shaw of Dunfermline and Lord Phillimore
that an action for damages for maintenance will not lie in the absence of proof
of special damage, Viscount Haldane and Lord Atkinson dissenting. It was held
by Lord Finlay, Viscount Haldane and Lord Atkinson that the success of the
maintained litigation, whether an action or a defence, is not a bar to the
right of action for maintenance, Lord Shaw of Dunfermlin eand Lord Phillimore
dissenting. Lord Abinger’s statement in Findon v. Parker[12] was expressly referred to
by only two of the peers. Lord Atkinson set it out with the object of
ascertaining the meaning to be ascribed to the words “they have no right to
make.” In his Lordship’s opinion they applied

[Page 453]

not to the persons maintained but to the persons
who maintained these latter. After quoting Lord Abinger’s statement at page 41914,
Lord Shaw of Dunfermline concludes: “In my opinion that is still the law of
England”; although on the particular point with which he was then concerned, he
was in disagreement with Lord Atkinson and in fact in the minority.

It is clear, however, from a perusal of all the
speeches in that case that no doubt was cast upon the general proposition that
to make a person liable as a maintainer, either civilly or criminally, he must
have intervened officiously or improperly. Lord Finlay really puts the matter
in that way by quoting the definition of maintenance in Hawkins’ Pleas of the
Crown. Viscount Haldane, at p. 39014, remarks:—

For the broad rule remains unrepealed by
any statute that it is unlawful for a stranger to render officious assistance
by money or otherwise to another person in a suit in which that third person
has himself no legal interest for its prosecution or defence.

Before quoting Lord Abinger’s statement, Lord
Atkinson had, at p. 39514, stated:—

If, however, the essence of the action of
maintenance be the officious intermeddling in or supporting litigation in which
the meddler has no legitimate interest * * * as I think it is.

Later (p. 397)14 he quotes the extract
from Prosser v. Edmonds15 and also (p. 405)14 the
extract from the Scott case16. There is really nothing inconsistent
with this view in the speech of Lord Phillimore.

These references to the speeches in the House of
Lords in the Neville case14 indicate that the views previously
expressed by various writers of standing and by a number of very able judges
have not been departed from and that there must exist that officious
interference, that introduction of parties to enforce rights which others are
not disposed to enforce, that stirring up of strife, to constitute the crime of
maintenance. In the present case Lallemand was disposed to enforce his claim,
and in fact had already consulted attorneys before his wife approached

[Page 454]

the appellant. The appellant did not intervene
on his own initiative and took no action that nay be in any way described as
stirring up strife and litigation.

The appeal must be allowed and the conviction
quashed.

CANNON J. – I am of opinion that this appeal
should be allowed and the conviction quashed.

Appeal allowed and conviction quashed.

and

His Majesty the
King Respondent.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

1939: October. 30; 1939: November. 30.

Present: Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.

Criminal law—Murder—Admission of facts
having prima facie no connection with crime, but liable to constitute
circumstantial evidence—Rule, as to warning to the jury in case of evidence by
accomplice, not binding on the trial judge when accomplice is not a witness—Objections
to evidence in criminal trials—Ought to be decided at once by the trial judge
and not be allowed under reserve of decision.

In a trial for murder, where the accused was
charged with having caused the death of her husband by poisoning, facts, which prima
facie may have no connection with the alleged crime, may nevertheless be

[Page 132]

allowed as evidence by the trial judge under
certain circumstances. In the present case, the facts, whose admittance was
objected to, were of such a nature as to establish the existence of feelings of
animosity, and even of hatred, on the part of the accused towards her husband;
and, in that case, such evidence was legal, not only to prove the intentions of
the accused, but also to establish one circumstance which, added to other
circumstances resulting from the evidence, was of a nature to justify a verdict
of guilty against the accused.—The King v. Barbour, [1938] S.C.R.
465; Rex v. Hall, [1911] A.C. 47; Rex v. Bond, [1906]
2 K.B. 389, and Paradis v. The King, [1934] S.C.R. 165, ref.

The well known rule, that the trial judge
must warn the jury of the danger of finding an accused guilty on the
uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, need not be followed by the trial
judge in his charge to the jury, when the alleged accomplice has not given
evidence and when only certain statements made by him in furtherance of the
common purpose were adduced in evidence.

Semble that,
in criminal matters, at a trial before a jury, all objections to evidence
should not be reserved for later adjudication by the trial judge, but should be
overruled or maintained before such evidence be admitted. Some prejudice may be
caused to the accused in the minds of the jury by certain evidence which may be
given before it, even, if, later on, the trial judge rules that such evidence
should be rejected and that the jury should not take it into account.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the conviction of the appellant on a charge of
murder.

The facts of the case and the questions at
issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.

R. Beaudoin K.C. for the appellant.

Noël Dorion K.C., A. Lacoursière and C. Noël
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Rinfret J.—L'appelante a été trouvée coupable d'avoir,
le dix-neuvième jour d'août 1937, dans
la paroisse de St-Méthode, P.Q., causé la mort de son mari en l'empoisonnant;
et la peine capitale a été prononcée contre elle.

Elle a interjeté appel devant la Cour du Banc du
Roi, qui a confirmé le verdict dans un jugement où quatre des juges ont
concouru et un juge fut dissident.

L'appelante porte maintenant sa cause devant cette
Cour sur les moyens de droit soulevés par la dissidence en Cour du Banc du Roi
et nous soumet que ces moyens devraient

[Page 133]

prévaloir pour faire annuler le verdict, ou, au
moins, pour lui obtenir un nouveau procès. C'est ce dernier remède que lui
aurait accordé le jugement qui a prononcé le dissentiment en appel.

Dans le jugement formel de la Cour du Banc du Roi,
les motifs de la dissidence sont exprimés comme suit:

1. Admission de preuve
illégale;

2. Mauvaise direction de la
part du juge présidant le procès, au préjudice de l'appelante;

3. La preuve de
circonstances apportée contre l'accusée ne justifiait pas en droit une
condamnation.

L'appelante est limitée par la loi aux griefs
d'appel qui sont mentionnés dans cette dissidence.

Il est douteux que le moyen résultant de
l'admission de preuve illégale pouvait valablement être soulevé devant la Cour
du Banc du Roi.

En effect, comme l'a fait remarquer le procureur de la Couronne, la seule allusion
que l'on trouve à ce sujet dans l'avis d'appel est la suivante, sous le titre:
""Griefs d'appel en droit"": ""Toute la preuve permise par la
Couronne et faite par elle est illégale.""

Et, sur motion de la Couronne, par un jugement
unanime de la Cour du Banc du Roi, il fut ordonné que ce paragraphe soit retranché
et rejeté de l'avis d'appel parce qu'il n'était pas exposé de façon précise et
circonstanciée et qu'il ne pouvait donc être retenu.

Il semble cependant que, malgré ce jugement, la
Cour du Banc du Roi a laissé faire devant elle la discussion de ce moyen, car
chacun des juges en fait mention dans ses notes et en discute la portée. Dans
les circonstances, comme nous avons entendu les arguments pour et contre à
l'audition, nous croyons préférable de nous prononcer sur ce premier grief.

A ce sujet, nous désirons seulement faire allusion,
en passant, à une remarque à l'effet que, au cours de l'enquête, bon nombre
d'objections auraient été prises sous réserve par l'honorable juge qui
présidait le procès et que, de cette façon, toutes les réponses auraient été
données devant le jury sans que, plus tard, dans sa charge, le savant juge ait
indiqué la décision qu'il entendait donner sur ces objections.

Nous n'ignorons pas combien il est difficile
parfois de décider sur-le-champ certaines objections à l'enquête.

[Page 134]

D'autre part, il n'est pas nécessaire d'insister
pour démontrer le préjudice qui peut être causé à un accusé dans l'esprit du
jury par certaine preuve qu'on laisse faire devant lui, même si, plus tard, le
juge déclare qu'elle doit être rejetée et que le jury ne doit pas en tenir
compte. Nous sommes d'avis que, dans une cause criminelle devant un jury, les
objections à l'enquête ne devraient jamais être prises sous réserve. Nous
croyons devoir en parler ici parce que le point a été soulevé devant nous; mais
nous ne pensons pas que la question se présente dans cette cause-ci, car le
savant procureur de la Couronne a affirmé que

No objection was taken under reserve by the
trial judge. All the objections were decided as soon as they were made. Consequently the accused surely could not be prejudiced.

Sur ce point, le dossier n'était
peut-être pas aussi satisfaisant qu'il aurait pu l'être; et il a dû être
complété par un document signé par le sténographe officiel; mais naturellement
nous acceptons la déclaration du procureur de la Couronne.

La preuve qui, selon l'avis du juge dissident,
n'aurait pas dû être permise peut en somme se rapporter à deux questions
principales.

La première a trait à une histoire de sortilège.
Elle est rapportée par deux témoins. Grondin, que l'accusée a épousé peu de
temps après la mort de son premier mari, aurait voulu rejeter contre ce dernier
un sortilège qu'il prétendait avoir reçu de lui. Dans l'esprit de Grondin, ce
sortilège aurait été retourné au moyen d'un écrit concernant ""les sorts""; et l'honorable juge dissident se demande à quoi cette histoire pouvait
rimer et pourquoi on a jugé à propos d'en encombrer la preuve.

Mais il fut établi que l'écrit dont Grondin voulait
se servir était de la main de l'accusée et qu'elle était au courant de l'usage
qu'il prétendait en faire. A la vérité, elle était disposée à lui donner sa
participation dans cette affaire. Quelle que soit l'opinion que l'on puisse
avoir de cette naîve machination, il nous semble que cette preuve pouvait tendre
à démontrer la nature des sentiments que l'accusée entretenait à l'égard de son
mari; et, comme nous le verrons plus loin, nous croyons qu'une preuve de ce
genre pouvait être permise dans les circonstances.

[Page 135]

L'autre reproche que l'appelante fait à l'enquête
de la Couronne, c'est que le juge de première instance n'aurait pas dû
permettre la preuve des relations entre l'accusée et un nommé Gilbert; vu que
cela ne pouvait avoir aucun rapport avec le crime reproché.

Nous croyons cependant que cette preuve pouvait
être permise en l'espèce pour la même raison que nous avons donnée plus haut au
sujet des histoires de sortilèges. Elle était certainement de nature à établir
l'existence de sentiments d'animosité, et même de haine, de la part de
l'accusée à l'égard de son mari; et, dans ce cas, elle était légale, non
seulement pour prouver l'intention de l'accusée, mais même pour établir une
circonstance qui, jointe aux autres circonstances résultant de la preuve, était
susceptible de justifier un verdict contre l'appelante.

Dans la cause de The
King v. Barbour1, que nous avons décidée tout récemment, nous avons ordonné un nouveau
procès par suite de l'admission de preuve illégale. Cependant, en discutant un
point semblable à celui dont il est ici question, l'honorable juge-en-chef, qui
a prononcé le jugement de la majorité, s'exprime comme suit:

The existence of such feelings would, as we
shall see, be relevant not merely in respect of intent, but in respect of the
fact as well.

Et, à la page 469, il continue:

If you have acts seriously tending, when
reasonably viewed, to establish motive for the commission of a crime, then
there can be no doubt that such evidence is admissible, not merely to prove
intent, but to prove the fact as well.

Et, en particulier, il s'appuie sur les deux
autorités suivantes, que nous croyons devoir citer: Rex v. Hall2,

où Lord Atkinson dit, à la page 68:

Surely in an ordinary prosecution for
murder you can prove previous acts or words of the accused to show he
entertained feelings of enmity towards the deceased, and that is evidence not
merely of the malicious mind with which he killed the deceased, but of the fact
that he killed him. You can give in evidence the enmity of the accused towards
the deceased to prove that the accused took the deceased's life. Evidence of
motive necessarily goes to prove the fact of the homicide by the accused, as
well as his ""malice aforethought.""

Dans le même sens, Lord
Loreburn cite avec approbation le passage suivant du
jugement de Kennedy, J., re Rex v. Bond3.

[Page 136]

The relations of the murdered or injured
man to his assailant, so far as they may reasonably be treated as explanatory
of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment, are properly
admitted to proof as integral parts of the history of the alleged crime for
which the accused is on his trial.

Nous pourrions également référer aux observations contenues dans le jugement de
cette Cour dans la cause de Paradis v. The
King4.

Pour ces raisons, nous croyons que le premier grief
d'appel doit être rejeté.

Il en est de même, à notre avis, du second grief à
l'effet que l'honorable juge présidant au procès aurait donné au jury une
mauvaise direction au préjudice de rappelante. Ce dont se plaint le savant
procureur de l'accusée, c'est que l'honorable président du tribunal aurait trop
librement donné son opinion sur les faits au cours de sa charge.

D'une façon générale, l'on peut dire qu'il faudrait
un cas bien exceptionnel pour considérer une objection de ce genre comme une
question de droit, et surtout pour mettre de côté un verdict de jury en se
fondant sur un pareil motif. Mais, en plus, dans la présente cause, le
président du tribunal a parfaitement délimité le champ d'action du jury et
celui du juge. A maintes reprises, il a répété au jury que les questions de
faits étaient exclusivement du domaine de ce dernier; et il leur a dit:

C'est votre opinion qu'il faut, et non la
mienne; et, dans l'exposé que je vais vous faire, ne voyez pas dans ce que je
vais vous dire une opinion; ce sera plutôt un exposé des faits pour vous
permettre de suivre intelligemment tous ceux qui ont été établis devant vous;
et si vous croyez y voir une opinion, ôtez-vous cela de l'esprit.

Avec la direction qui a été donnée au jury par le
président du tribunal, nous ne voyons pas quel préjudice pouvait résulter à
l'appelante de l'exposé des faits par le juge.

Le procureur de l'appelante se plaint, en outre,
que le juge aurait omis complètement de mettre le jury en garde contre la
preuve apportée par un complice. Il dit que la Couronne aurait tenté d'établir
la complicité de Grondin et également celle de Gilbert, et que le juge n'a
donné aucune direction au jury quant à la preuve qui pouvait émaner de ces deux
personnes.

[Page 137]

La règle qui doit être suivie dans la direction à
donner au jury à l'égard d'un complice est bien connue; mais elle ne s'applique
que lorsque le complice a rendu témoignage. Elle consiste à prévenir le jury du danger de condamner un accusé en se
basant uniquement sur le témoignage du complice. Ici, il n'y a pas le moindre
doute que la Couronne cherchait à établir la complicité de Grondin. Mais, comme
Grondin n'a pas rendu témoignage, il s'ensuit qu'il ne s'agit pas dans l'espèce
de l'un des cas où le juge devait mettre la règle en pratique.

Cependant le procureur de l'appelante est allé plus
loin. Il a fait remarquer que certaines déclarations de Grondin avaient été
mises en preuve; et il a prétendu que si le juge était tenu de mettre le jury
en garde contre le témoignage d'un complice, il en devrait être de même de la
preuve des déclarations que ce complice aurait pu faire.

Nous ne croyons pas que la règle puisse être
étendue jusque-là. Comme nous venons de le dire, l'un des points que la
Couronne tentait d'établir contre l'accusée était qu'elle avait agi de
complicité avec Grondin. Dans les circonstances, il nous paraît que la Couronne
avait le droit de prouver les actes et les déclarations de Grondin dans
l'exécution du projet commun; et il n'importe pas que le complice dont on tente
de prouver les actes ou les paroles soit ou non mis en accusation en même temps
que le défendeur.

Dans la cause de Wark5, monsieur le juge Phillimore eut à se
prononcer sur une question de ce genre; et voici la décision qu'il rend à la
page 616:

On all indictments for crime, and not only in
cases in which the indictment is for high treason or conspiracy, where the case
for the prosecution is that the crime was the result of a conspiracy, and where
evidence has been adduced fit for the jury to consider in proof of the common
purpose, any act done by any of the confederates in furtherance of the common
purpose may be given in evidence against all. Regina v. Desmond6—per Chief
Justice Corkburn and Baron Bramwell—is an instance of this. ""Such acts may
include speech. A request in words is clearly as admissible as a request by
sign or pantomime.""

Voir également ce que dit Lord
Alverstone, C.J., dans la cause de Rex v. Duguid7.

C'est d'ailleurs l'opinion qui a été adoptée par
cette Cour dans la cause de Paradis v. The
King8, déjà citée.

[Page 138]

Quant à l'omission de
donner une direction au sujet de la complicité de Gilbert, ce moyen doit être
écarté pour la simple raison que, suivant nous, il n'y a rien dans le dossier
qui permet de conclure à cette complicité.

Il ne reste que le troisième grief d'appel, à
savoir que la preuve de circonstances apportée contre l'accusée ne justifiait
pas sa condamnation. Sur ce point, nous ne croyons pas utile d'entrer dans les
détails de la preuve. Les notes des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi en
contiennent une analyse minutieuse et circonstanciée.

Il ne saurait y avoir de doute que le verdict
concluant à l'empoisonnement de Brochu pouvait amplement se justifier. Nous ne
comprenons pas d'ailleurs que ce soit là le point sur lequel a porté l'opinion
du juge dissident; et ce n'est pas, non plus, celui sur lequel le procureur de
l'appelante a insisté. Le grief consiste plutôt à dire que toute la preuve
contre l'accusée se bornait à une preuve de circonstances et que cette preuve
n'était pas suffisante, en l'espèce, pour permettre au jury de conclure que
l'empoisonnement avait été causé par l'appelante.

Voici comment le juge présidant le procès exposa
aux jurés leurs devoirs sur ce point:

Quand vous aurez étudié la preuve qui a été
faite devant vous, preuve de circonstances, dans son entier, pour en
tirer une conclusion, voici ce qu'il faut: Vous devez être convaincus, hors de
tout doute raisonnable, et quand je parle de doute raisonnable, c'est toujours
le doute raisonnable que je viens de vous expliquer il y a un instant, c'est un
doute raisonnable, dis-je, que non seulement tous les faits prouvés à votre
satisfaction conduisent à la seule
conclusion que l'accusée est coupable, si vous trouvez que l'accusée est
coupable, mais aussi qu'il ne peut y avoir d'autres hypothèses, d'autres
suppositions raisonnables que c'est elle qui est coupable. En d'autres termes,
la preuve doit produire la conviction hors de tout doute, que tous les faits
conduisent à la culpabilité de l'accusée, et non seulement ça, mais qu'il n'y a
pas d'autres explications possibles du crime, aucune autre hypothèse
raisonnable.

* * *

Si vous en venez à la conclusion que vous
pouvez trouver non pas, quatre, cinq ou six hypothèses, mais une seule
hypothèse raisonnable pour expliquer qu'elle n'est pas coupable, c'est
suffisant; mais il faut que cette hypothèse là en soit une raisonnable. Je suis
certain que le verdict que vous allez rendre va être un verdict basé, comme je
l'ai dit et comme votre serment vous y oblige, basé sur la preuve, non pas sur
des sentiments, non pas sur des suppositions, non pas sur des nouvelles
publiées dans les journaux, mais sur la preuve et sur la preuve telle que faite
devant vous. Comme je vous l'ai dit, et j'y reviens encore: cette preuve doit
être prise dans son ensemble. Vous n'avez pas à vous baser sur un fait
particulier; ce serait le moyen le plus sûr de se tromper. C'est sur l'ensemble
que vous devez vous baser, la vue d'ensemble de

[Page 139]

toute la preuve des deux parties. Vous devez avoir cette vue d'ensemble, et c'est de cette vue d'ensemble
que doit sortir une conclusion de culpabilité ou de non-culpabilité. Et en
ayant cette vue d'ensemble-là, vous ne pouvez pas perdre de vue que vous
devez le bénéfice du doute raisonnable à l'accusée. Si vous avez un doute
raisonnable, je vous dirai encore que vous devez ce doute à l'accusée; il lui
appartient, c'est à elle.

Déjà antérieurement le juge avait dit aux jurés:

Si après avoir étudié la preuve, vous avez un
doute raisonnable de la culpabilité de l'accusée, c'est votre devoir de
l'acquitter.

C'est après avoir reçu une direction de ce genre
que le jury en est arrivé à son verdict de culpabilité. Il avait devant lui
tous les faits et toutes les circonstances. Il avait également les déclarations
de rappelante, nullement provoquées, et qui, il faut le dire, étaient d'une
extrême gravité.

Avec la majorité des juges de la Cour du Banc du
Roi, nous sommes d'avis que le jury pouvait certainement tirer des
circonstances et des déclarations qui ont été prouvées la conclusion
raisonnable que l'appelante était coupable du crime dont on l'accusait; et nous ne nous croirions pas justifiables
pour cette raison de mettre de côté le verdict qui l'a condamnée.

Pour ces motifs, nous croyons que l'appel doit être
rejeté.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal—Trial on charge of murder—Misdirection to
jury—Provocation—Onus in general—Power of court on appeal—Substitution of
verdict of manslaughter for jury’s verdict of murder—Cr. Code, ss. 1016, 1024;
Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35.

On the occasion of a quarrel between appellant and S.,
appellant killed S., and then killed S.’s wife who had not been present at the
quarrel or the killing of S. but on hearing shouts had appeared at her house
door a few feet away. Appellant was tried on the charge of murder of S. and was
found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years penal servitude. He was
later tried on the charge of murder of Mrs. S. and was convicted of the crime
charged. This conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered on the ground
that the trial Judge had misdirected the jury on the question of provocation
([1937] O.R. 693; [1938] S.C.R. 18). Appellant was then tried again on the
charge of murder of Mrs. S. and convicted of the crime charged. An appeal to
the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed ([1938] O.R. 385), but two Judges
dissented, holding that there was error in certain respects in the trial
Judge’s charge to the jury and there should be a new trial. Appellant appealed
to this Court.

Held (allowing the appeal): There was a mistrial. The
conviction should be set aside.

[Page 342]

The putting before the jury, in the trial Judge’s charge, of a
sentence, taken from the judgment of one of the Judges of the Court of Appeal
on the appeal from the first conviction of appellant of murder of Mrs. S., that
the said Judge in Appeal was “far from suggesting that the conduct of the
accused would not justify a verdict of wilful murder,” constituted, in the
circumstances, error of such gravity as to vitiate the verdict. While the trial
Judge was entitled, if so advised, to express his own opinion as to the effect
of the evidence actually before the jury, it was inadmissible to present to
them the opinion of any one that on the former trial the evidence was
sufficient to justify a conviction for murder. Moreover, the effect of this was
probably accentuated by the record of appellant’s conviction of the murder of
Mrs. S. endorsed on the indictment which was put in the jury’s hands, said
record being “Guilty—Sentenced to be hanged, May 31, 1937.” In the
circumstances of the case, said record should have been withheld from them; a
copy of the indictment with the endorsement omitted would have served every
legitimate purpose.

Another serious objection was that the trial Judge, in
answering a question from the jury with regard to provocation, did not direct
them in the precise and unambiguous terms in which they ought to have been
instructed. Moreover, the terms in which the jury’s question was expressed
manifested an erroneous impression that, in proving the killing, the Crown had
disposed of the presumption of accused’s innocence and that they must find him
guilty of murder unless he affirmatively established to their satisfaction provocation
in the pertinent sense; and their question should have been answered in such a
manner as to remove this error from their minds; it ought to have been made
clear to them that in the last resort the accused could not properly be
convicted of murder if, as the result of the evidence as a whole, they were in
reasonable doubt whether or not he was guilty of that crime.

As to an objection taken by the dissenting Judges in the Court
of Appeal to the effect that the trial Judge erred in instructing the jury that
they were not concerned with the fact that appellant had been acquitted of the
charge of murder of S. and found guilty of the less grave offence of
manslaughter:

Held per Duff C.J., Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson
JJ.: (1) Plainly, the trial Judge would have committed an error in law if he
had told the jury that a finding of provocation in appellant’s trial for murder
of S. was conclusive upon the issue of provocation then before them; the issue
of provocation was not the same in the two cases. (Opinion expressed that said
dissenting Judges had not meant to suggest otherwise on this point).

2. As to the suggestion that the trial Judge ought to have
told the jury that they must take it as an established fact that the acts of S.
constituted sufficient provocation to reduce the homicide committed upon him to
manslaughter, and, starting from that point, consider the issue of provocation
in its bearing upon the charge against appellant of murder of Mrs. S.: Such a
direction would probably be calculated to confuse and mislead the jury in
respect of the actual issue upon which it was their duty then and there to
pass. Moreover, such a direction would have been wrong; the evidence given at
the earlier trial (for the killing of S.) was not placed fully before the court
nor was the trial Judge’s charge; nor, with such material before him, could the
trial Judge (on the trial for the kill-

[Page 343]

ing of Mrs. S.) have been warranted in directing the jury that
at said earlier trial any issue of provocation had been decided; the jury may
on that (earlier) trial have thought, without passing upon any such issue, that
the evidence raised a sufficient doubt as to accused’s guilt in respect of the
charge of murder to require an acquittal on that charge.

Crocket J., in view of the principle as to the question of
provocation which he took to be clearly deducible from this Court’s decision in
The King v. Manchuk, [1938] S.C.R. 18, in view of the established fact
that appellant, on his trial for murder of S., had been found guilty of
manslaughter only, and in view of the circumstances attending the killing of S.
and Mrs. S., and it being quite apparent (as he held) that appellant in
attacking Mrs. S. was acting upon the same impulse as that which caused him to
attack S., was strongly inclined to agree with the reasoning of the dissenting
Judges in the Court of Appeal on the applicability of the principles of res
judicata.

As to the order that ought to be made by this Court:

Per Duff C.J., Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.: It
was clear that the jury must have been satisfied of the facts necessary to
constitute manslaughter; and the Court of Appeal would have authority under s.
1016, Cr. Code, to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict
of the jury and to pronounce sentence upon appellant (Rex v. Hopper,
[1915] 2 K.B. 431). By force of s. 1024 Cr. Code, coupled with the
enactments of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35), this Court
has authority, not only to order a new trial, or to quash the conviction and
direct the prisoner’s discharge, but also to give the judgment which the Court
of Appeal was empowered to give in virtue of s. 1016 (2), Cr. Code.
Under the exceptional circumstances of the case the last mentioned course is
the proper one. The conviction should be set aside, a verdict of manslaughter
substituted for the jury’s verdict and appellant sentenced to imprisonment for
life.

Per Crocket J. (dissenting on this point): Considering
the proceedings already undergone and in the anomalous circumstances of the
case, justice would best be served by quashing the present conviction
absolutely. Further, there is no doubt as to this Court’s right to quash the
conviction; there may be some doubt as to its right to enter a judgment which
necessarily involves its rendering a verdict in a criminal case and itself
passing sentence upon it; the wisdom of the latter course is very doubtful; it
would signalize an entirely new departure in the exercise of the jurisdiction
of this Court in criminal cases.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1]
sustaining (Middleton and Gillanders JJ.A. dissenting) his conviction, on trial
before Hope J. and a jury, of the murder of Amy Seabright at St. Catharines,
Ontario, on June 8, 1936.

Just before the accused killed Amy Seabright, he had killed her
husband, John Seabright, in a quarrel. Accused was tried on the charge of
murder of John Seabright and was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to
20 years

[Page 344]

penal servitude. He was later tried on the charge of murder of
Amy Seabright and was convicted of the crime charged. This conviction was set
aside and a new trial ordered on the ground that the trial judge had
misdirected the jury on the question of provocation[2].
Accused was tried again on the charge of murder of Amy Seabright and convicted
of the crime charged. An appeal by the accused to the Court of Appeal for
Ontario was dismissed (Middleton and Gillanders JJ.A. dissenting)[3].
From that dismissal the present appeal to this Court was brought. The dissent
in the Court of Appeal was, as expressed in the formal judgment of that Court,
on the question as to whether there was error in the charge of the learned
trial judge, and whether such error amounted to a substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice. The dissenting judges held that there should be a new trial.

By the judgment now reported, the appeal to this Court was
allowed; the judgment of the Court of Appeal was set aside; the Court directed
that the verdict of murder be quashed and a verdict of manslaughter be entered.
Crocket J., dissenting, would quash the conviction absolutely. The appellant
was sentenced to imprisonment for life.

J.C. McRuer K.C. and J.J. Bench K.C. for the appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. and C.P. Hope K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the majority of the Court (The Chief Justice and
Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.) was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—On the 8th of June, 1936, the appellant
William Manchuk killed, first, John Seabright, and, shortly afterwards, his
wife, Amy Seabright. Evidence was given by Mrs. Lewis, the daughter of
John and Amy Seabright, that, after killing her father, and before the attack
upon her mother, Manchuk attempted an attack upon her with the axe with which
he killed her parents, but she succeeded in escaping.

[Page 345]

These tragic events were the culmination of a dispute about the
location of a line fence between the properties respectively occupied by the
Seabrights and the Manchuks. On the day on which the homicides occurred, John
Seabright was engaged in excavating post holes and setting up posts for a fence
which would encroach upon property that Manchuk believed to be exclusively his.
Manchuk and his wife protested against these proceedings in violent and
threatening language and, eventually, Manchuk who, as the evidence shows,
notwithstanding his wife’s incitements to violence, had for a time succeeded in
keeping himself under control, yielded to a passion of rage and committed the
fatal assault on John Seabright, killing him by blows delivered with an axe.

The scene of the killing of John Seabright is only a few feet
from the porch of the Seabrights’ house. Mrs. Seabright had been within the
house during the occurrences just described and had no visible connection with
them. She appeared at the door on hearing the shouts of her daughter and was
immediately attacked by Manchuk who, with the same weapon, inflicted upon her
wounds from which she died shortly afterwards.

Manchuk was tried for the murder of John Seabright, and John
Seabright’s acts, already mentioned, were relied upon as constituting
provocation. The jury found Manchuk guilty of manslaughter and he was
accordingly sentenced to twenty years penal servitude. Manchuk was then tried
under an indictment charging him with the murder of Amy Seabright and was
convicted of the crime charged. This conviction was set aside and a new trial
ordered[4]. The
learned trial judge had (it was held by this Court[5],
confirming a judgment of the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal) erroneously
directed the jury that there was no evidence upon which they could properly
find the attack upon Amy Seabright to have been delivered under such
provocation as to justify a finding of manslaughter.

In the judgment of this Court, the law concerning the nature of
provocation in the relevant sense and its effect in justifying a verdict of
manslaughter, when in its absence

[Page 346]

the proper verdict would be one of murder, was in its application
to the circumstances of this case explained for the guidance of the trial judge
at the new trial. In effect it was stated that, on the issue of provocation,
the jury ought to be directed to consider, first, whether the acts of
provocation, which proceeded immediately from John Seabright, were of such a character
as to deprive a normal person of his self-control to such a degree as might
lead such a person to commit an attack upon Mrs. Seabright of the character of
that of which Manchuk was guilty; and, second, whether Manchuk in fact did act
under such provocation while still under the dominion of the passion excited
thereby and under the belief that she was concerned in the acts of provocation
relied upon. But the judgment proceeded to say that the learned trial judge
would, of course, warn the jury that, on the ultimate issue (raised by the
charge of murder), unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that
Manchuk was guilty of the more heinous crime, it would be their duty not to
convict him upon that charge.

At the new trial, the accused was found guilty of the murder of
Amy Seabright and convicted and sentenced accordingly. An appeal to the Ontario
Court of Appeal was dismissed (Mr. Justice Middleton and Mr. Justice
Gillanders dissenting)[6] and the
case now comes before this Court on appeal from that judgment.

The appeal is by law necessarily limited to the grounds upon
which those learned judges dissented. Those grounds are three in number. First,
the learned judge erred (the learned dissenting judges held) in instructing the
jury that they were not concerned with the fact that Manchuk had been acquitted
of the charge of murder of John Seabright and had found him guilty of the less
grave offence of manslaughter. If we read the judgment of the learned judges
rightly, it seems to say that the learned trial judge ought to have told the
jury that they must take it as an established fact that the acts of John
Seabright constituted sufficient provocation to reduce the homicide committed
upon him to manslaughter; and, starting from that point, consider the issue of
provocation in its bearing upon the charge against the accused of the murder of
Amy Seabright. It sufficiently appears from what has already been said that

[Page 347]

the issue of provocation was not the same in the two cases, and,
plainly, the trial judge would have committed an error in law if he had told
them that a finding of provocation in the trial of Manchuk for the murder of
John Seabright was conclusive upon the issue of provocation then before them,
and we do not think the learned dissenting judges meant to suggest this.

Putting other considerations aside for the moment, we should have
been disposed to think that such a direction as that suggested would foe
calculated to confuse and mislead the jury in respect of the actual issue upon
which it was their duty then and there to pass; it would, as we are inclined to
think, demand from the jury the application of a degree of critical acumen
which they could hardly be expected to exercise; and would probably have
nullified the judgment of this Court as applicable to this case.

Moreover, such a direction would, in our opinion, have been
wrong. The evidence given at the earlier trial was not placed fully before the
court nor was the charge of the learned trial judge. Nor, with such material
before him could Mr. Justice Hope have been warranted in directing the jury
that at the first trial any issue of provocation had been decided. The jury may
on that trial have thought, without passing upon any such issue, that the
evidence raised a sufficient doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner in respect
of the charge of murder to require an acquittal on that charge.

We think, however, that the two other grounds of dissent are well
taken and, accordingly, that there was a mistrial.

The first of these arises in this way: The learned trial judge
put before the jury the following sentence taken from the judgment delivered by
Mr. Justice Middleton on the last occasion when the case was before the Court
of Appeal for Ontario:—

In the case in hand I am far from suggesting that the
conduct of the accused would not justify a verdict of wilful murder.

This, we think, constituted in the circumstances error of such
gravity as to vitiate the verdict.

While the learned trial judge was entitled, if he had been so
advised, to express his own opinion as to the effect of the evidence actually
before the jury, we can have no doubt that it was inadmissible to present to
the jury the

[Page 348]

opinion of any one that on the former trial the evidence was
sufficient to justify a conviction of the accused of the murder of Amy
Seabright. The mischief was enhanced by the circumstance that this opinion was
ascribed to an eminent judge whose authority would naturally carry great weight
with the jury. We think nothing said in the charge, either before or later, had
or could have the effect of neutralizing this statement of the learned trial
judge and rendering it innocuous.

We think, moreover, that the effect of it was probably
accentuated by the record of the conviction of Manchuk of the murder of Amy
Seabright endorsed on the indictment which was put in the hands of the jury.
The record was in these words, “Guilty—Sentenced to be hanged, May 31, 1937.”
We agree with the dissenting judges that, in the circumstances of the case,
this record should have been withheld from them. A copy of the indictment with
the endorsement omitted would have served every legitimate purpose.

We attach even greater importance to another ground upon which
the learned dissenting judges proceeded. The jury, having had the case under
consideration for some time, requested the assistance of the learned trial
judge upon a difficulty which they explained in the following question:—

In order to reduce a murder charge to a manslaughter charge,
is it necessary to establish the fact that the person killed committed the act
of provocation?

In the opinion of the dissenting judges, the jury were not given
a direction in the precise and unambiguous terms in which they ought have been
instructed in answer to their request; and we find ourselves in agreement with
them. The learned trial judge appears to have read, interlarded with comments
of his own, nearly the whole of the judgment of this Court, but with the
significant exception presently to be noted, on the appeal already mentioned.
The judgment contained a considerable amount of discussion of principle and
authority as touching the point on which we found ourselves unable to accept
the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. In the earlier
part of his charge the learned trial judge had discussed the subject of
provocation in a manner calculated to convey an impression that there were
differences of

[Page 349]

opinion among Canadian judges upon the very question which the
jury had addressed to him. We are not satisfied that the lengthy answer of the
learned trial judge, expressed as it was in general terms, was calculated to
convey to the jury a right conception of what might constitute provocation
under the law.

The dissent of the learned dissenting judges, moreover, embraces
another objection to this part of the charge, which, in our opinion, is,
perhaps, still more serious. The terms in which the question is expressed
manifest plainly that (notwithstanding some observations in the earlier part of
the charge as to the burden resting upon the Crown up to the end of the case of
establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt) they had fallen into the very
natural error of thinking that, in proving the killing, the Crown had disposed
of the presumption of the prisoner’s innocence and that they must find the
prisoner guilty of murder unless he affirmatively established to their
satisfaction provocation in the pertinent sense. The interrogatory of the jury
ought to have been answered in such a manner as to remove this error from their
minds. It ought to have been made clear to them that in the last resort the
prisoner could not properly be convicted of murder if, as the result of the
evidence as a whole, they were in reasonable doubt whether or not he was guilty
of that crime. The last sentence of the judgment of this Court which was put
before the jury almost in its entirety, deals with this point and that sentence
was not even read to them (Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions[7]).

There remains for consideration the grave question as to the
order that ought to be made by this Court. We have concluded, after full
consideration, that, by force of section 1024, coupled with the enactments of
the Supreme Court Act, this Court has authority, not only to order a new
trial, or to quash the conviction and direct the discharge of the prisoner, but
also to give the judgment which the Court of Appeal for Ontario was empowered
to give in virtue of s. 1016 (2); and we have no doubt that this last
mentioned course is the proper one in the very exceptional circumstances of
this case.

[Page 350]

The accused has been tried three times under charges of murder
arising out of a succession of occurrences which occupied in time not more than
a few minutes. The last two convictions have both been set aside by reason of
the irregular conduct of the trials leading to those convictions; the first by
a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed by this Court; and, now,
the second, by the judgment of this Court. We cannot think that to order a
fourth trial would be entirely consonant with the spirit of our criminal
procedure; and we think the ends of justice will be met by the judgment we now
pronounce.

The finding makes it clear that the jury must have been satisfied
of the facts necessary to constitute manslaughter, and we are, consequently, of
opinion that the Court of Appeal would have authority under s. 1016 to
substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict of the jury and to
pronounce sentence upon the prisoner (Rex v. Hopper[8]).

The conviction should be set aside, a verdict of manslaughter
should be substituted for the verdict of the jury and the accused sentenced to
imprisonment for life.

CROCKET J. (dissenting as to the order to be made)—In December
last this Court on an appeal by the Crown affirmed a judgment of the Ontario
Court of Appeal setting aside a conviction of Manchuk for the murder of one,
Amy Seabright, and ordering a new trial on the ground that the trial judge by
instructing the jury that there must be provocation by the victim had withdrawn
from their consideration the question of provocation[9].
The clear implication of this decision, as I view it, is that, notwithstanding
there was no evidence of any provocation whatever on the part of the victim
herself, there nevertheless was evidence upon which the jury might reasonably
have found that in attacking her as he did he did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation within the meaning of s. 261  of the Criminal
Code , that is to say, caused by any wrongful act or insult of such a nature
as to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, if the offender
acts upon it on the sudden and before there has been time for his passion to
cool. No other principle, to

[Page 351]

my mind, is fairly deducible from that decision as regards the
question of provocation than that it is not always necessary to constitute
provocation under s. 261  of the Criminal Code  that it should proceed
immediately and directly from the victim herself, but that, on the contrary, a
wrongful act or insult, committed or given by a third person under such
circumstances as the evidence in this case disclosed, may constitute such
provocation if the offender in his attack upon the victim acted upon it on a
sudden and before his passion had time to cool and under the belief that the
victim was a party to any such act, although not implicated in it in fact.

It was admitted by counsel for the Crown and for the appellant
that the evidence on the second trial, bearing on the crucial issue of provocation,
was to all intents and purposes the same as that on the first trial.

This shews that Manchuk had been previously tried on an
indictment charging him and his wife jointly with the murder of John Seabright
on June 8th, 1936, upon which he was found guilty of manslaughter only; that
during the forenoon of that day, while John Seabright was attempting against
the protests of both Mr. and Mrs. Manchuk to replace a post of a board fence,
which a sworn surveyor had found to encroach between one and two feet on
Manchuk’s home property and which as a consequence had recently been removed,
the accused, after having succeeded in restraining his wife from attacking
Seabright with a stone and later with an axe which he took away from her, and
after having himself requested Seabright to desist and go home, finally became
so enraged at Seabright’s determined defiance of his property rights, that,
while the latter’s daughter (Mrs. Lewis) was standing by the post hole with a
hammer in her hand, he struck him three times in rapid succession with the axe
he still had in his hand, and killed him; and that within the course of a
moment or two at the most, after first attempting an attack upon Mrs. Lewis,
who yelled and ran away, he rushed across the driveway to the back porch of the
Seabright house, in which Mrs. Seabright had suddenly appeared, and there on or
in front of the steps at a distance of but 11 feet from the spot where he had
killed her husband, struck her with the same axe and caused her death.

[Page 352]

There is absolutely nothing to shew that Mrs. Seabright said or
did anything before Manchuk saw her that morning, and it is quite apparent that
in attacking her he was acting upon the same impulse as that which caused him
to attack her husband at the post hole. This obviously is the view of Mr.
Justice Middleton, and the basis on which he has so interestingly dealt with
the question of the applicability of the principles of res judicata.
While I am strongly inclined to agree with his reasoning in this regard, it
does not seem to be necessary to consider it beyond its possible bearing on the
question of the final disposition of this appeal. If it were recognized in this
case that the rule that a question of fact distinctly put in issue and directly
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be disputed in a
subsequent proceeding between the same parties or their privies was as
applicable to criminal as well as to civil proceedings, it would have the
merit, at least, of rendering impossible the repetition of such an
extraordinary and anomalous development as that which this unfortunate and
tragic case illustrates.

With great respect, I should be disposed to think that a person
who has been tried on an indictment charging him with murder in the killing of
S. and found guilty, not of murder but of manslaughter only—clearly on the
ground of provocation—and sentenced therefor to 20 years penal servitude;
has subsequently undergone a trial on another murder indictment for the killing
of S.’s wife practically at the same time and within but a few feet of the spot
where he slew her husband, and apparently acting upon the same provocation, and
nevertheless been convicted on that indictment for murder and undergone the
ordeal of waiting for the infliction of the necessary death penalty; and then,
in consequence of this conviction having been set aside on the ground that the
all important question of provocation was improperly withdrawn from the jury,
having undergone a second trial on the same indictment, and been again
erroneously convicted and sentenced to death while still serving a sentence of
20 years imprisonment for killing Seabright in the heat of passion caused by
sudden provocation—has surely suffered adequate punishment for the crime to
which he was provoked under such circumstances and which in those circumstances
can be

[Page 353]

treated as two separate and distinct offences only by the
application of the strictest rules of law.

In my opinion, as this Court has unanimously decided that there
was such error in the conduct of the second trial as to vitiate the verdict for
the reasons stated in the judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice, justice will
best be served in the anomalous circumstances of this case by quashing the
present conviction. To send the accused back on what will really be his fourth
trial for murder is so repellent that it ought to be avoided, if at all
possible. I confess that I have great doubt as to the wisdom of this Court
entering a judgment which necessarily involves our rendering a verdict in a
criminal case and ourselves passing sentence upon it. There may possibly be
some doubt as to our right to do so. There can be none as to our right to quash
the conviction.

If a new conviction is now found by us, it can only be for
manslaughter in causing the death of Mrs. Seabright by reason of the accused
having attacked her while still in the heat of passion caused by the same
provocation under which he slew her husband. The infliction upon him now of any
further term of imprisonment to run concurrently with that of the 20-year
sentence he is now serving would really add nothing to his punishment, while it
would signalize an entirely new departure in the exercise of the jurisdiction
of this court in criminal cases.

Appeal allowed; the judgment of the Court of Appeal set
aside; direction that the verdict of murder be quashed and a verdict of
manslaughter entered; appellant sentenced to imprisonment for life.

Solicitor for the appellant: J.J. Bench.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA IN BANCO

Criminal law—Indictment attacked as bad for
multiplicity—Several matters stated in alternative—Cr. Code, s. 854—Charge
under s. 193 (3) of Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42, and amendments—Form of
verdict.

Appellants were charged and convicted on an
indictment that they “did * * * assist or were otherwise concerned in the
importing, unshipping, landing or removing or subsequent transporting or in the
harbouring of goods liable to forfeiture under the Customs Act , to wit:
spirituous liquors of a value for duty of over” $200, contrary to s. 193 (3) of
said Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42, and amendments. The indictment was attacked on
the ground that it was bad for multiplicity, in that appellants were charged
with several offences in the alternative in the one count.

Held: The
attack on the indictment failed. Appellants were not charged with any one of
the offences of “importing,” “unshipping.” etc. They were charged with an
offence created by s. 193  of the Customs Act , which creates a
substantive offence, and the guilt of a person charged thereunder depends in no
degree whatever upon the fact or otherwise that the acts in which such person
is concerned are themselves offences. S. 854 of the Cr. Code applies.

Held, also,
that the form of the jury’s verdict, finding accused “guilty of harbouring
only,” was unobjectionable when read in connection with the indictment and the
trial Judge’s charge.

Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in
banco, 12 M.P.R. 483, sustaining, on equal division, the conviction of
accused, affirmed.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], which, on equal division, dismissed
their appeal from their conviction, at trial before Graham J. and a jury, on an
indictment that they

did * * * assist or were otherwise concerned
in the importing, unshipping, landing or removing or subsequent transporting or
in the harbouring of goods liable to forfeiture under the Customs Act , to wit:
spirituous liquors of a value for duty of over Two Hundred Dollars,

contrary to s. 193 (3) of the Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42, and
amendments thereto.

At trial, before plea by the accused, their
counsel objected to the indictment, claiming that it was bad for a

[Page 424]

multiplicity of charges. The trial Judge
over-ruled the objection.

After the jury had been charged and had
retired, they returned and asked for instruction with regard to the form of
verdict. The trial Judge instructed them as follows:—

I understand you want to know whether or not
you can specify on which of the matters you find the accused guilty. There are
a number in the indictment—did: assist or were otherwise concerned in the
importing, unshipping, landing, removing, subsequent transportation of or in
the harbouring—and I say to you that if you find them guilty of any of these
things you may find them “guilty” and leave it at that. It is not necessary for
you to pick out one of them. If you find they assisted or were otherwise
concerned in the importing you may find them “guilty.” If you find they
assisted or were otherwise concerned in the unshipping or the landing or the
removing or the, subsequent transportation of the liquor, a verdict of,
“guilty” will cover it. I don’t think it would be an error if you designated
the particular thing of which you found them guilty, but it seems to me there
is less likelihood of an error if you enter the general verdict of guilty.

Bring in whatever verdict you think proper,
and if for any reason I think it is incomplete or not satisfactory I will tell
you or send you back.

The jury found the accused “guilty of
harbouring only.”

The grounds of appeal specified by the
accused in their notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in
banco were:—

1. Because the indictment charged six
offences and thereby prejudiced us in our defence;

2. Because the indictment is bad for
multiplicity and should have been quashed when the motion was made to quash
same before we pleaded;

3. Because the special verdict found by the
jury does not constitute an indictable offence;

4. Because the learned trial Judge erred in
instructing the jury that they could bring in a verdict of guilty of any one of
the particular offences mentioned in the indictment.

The appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia in banco was dismissed on equal division; the judgment for
dismissal of the appeal being written by Doull J., concurred in by Hall J.; and
the judgment contra (in favour of directing a new trial) was written by
Carroll J., concurred in by Archibald J.[2]

The accused appealed to this Court. By the
judgment now reported, the appeal was dismissed.

[Page 425]

The judgment of the court was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia dismissing by an equal division an appeal from the judgment of Mr.
Justice Graham who, at the trial, had rejected a motion to quash the
indictment. The indictment is as follows:—

Louis Gatto and Alphonse Tonellatto, of the
Town of New Water-ford, in the.
County of Cape Breton, Province of Nova Scotia, did on or about the
twenty-fourth day of December, in the year of Our Lord, One Thousand Nine
Hundred and Thirty-six, at or near Gabarus, in the said county and province,
assist or were otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing or
removing or subsequent transporting or in the harbouring of goods liable to
forfeiture under the Customs Act , to wit:

spirituous liquors of a value for duty of
over Two Hundred Dollars, contrary to subsection 3  of section 193  of the
Customs Act , being chapter 42 of the Revised States of Canada, 1927, and
amendments thereto, being the form of Statute in that behalf made and provided.

The application to quash proceeded on the ground
that the indictment is bad for multiplicity, that is to say, that several
offences are charged in one count.

We have carefully considered the able judgment
of Mr. Justice Carroll (with whom Mr. Justice Archibald concurred) who thought
the appeal should be allowed and the indictment quashed; but have come to the
conclusion that the weight of argument is definitely in favour of the view
expressed in the judgment of Mr. Justice Doull, who agreed with the view of the
learned trial judge.

The charge is laid under subsection 3  of section
193  of the Customs Act . Section 193  is in these words:—

193. (1) All vessels, with the guns,
tackle, apparel and furniture thereof, and all vehicles, harness, tackle,
horses and cattle made use of in the importation or unshipping or landing or
removal or subsequent transportation of any goods liable to forfeiture under
this Act, shall be seized and forfeited.

(2) Every person who assists or is
otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing or removing or
subsequent transporting, or in the harbouring of such goods, or into whose
control or possession the same come without lawful excuse, the proof of which
shall be on the person accused, shall, in addition to any other penalty,
forfeit a sum equal to the value of such goods, which may be recovered in any
court of competent jurisdiction, and, where the value for duty of such goods is
under two hundred dollars, shall further be liable on summary conviction before
two justices of the peace to a penalty not exceeding two hundred dollars and
not less than fifty dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one
month, or to both fine and imprisonment.

(3) Where the value for duty of the goods
so imported, unshipped, landed, removed, subsequently transported, or harboured
or found, is two hundred dollars or over, such person shall be guilty of an
indictable

[Page 426]

offence and liable on conviction, in
addition to other penalties to which he is subject for any such offence, to a
penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars and not less than two hundred
dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years and not less
than one year, or to both fine and imprisonment.

The argument on behalf of the appellant is that
under this section “importing” goods of the character to which it relates is
one offence, “unshipping” another offence, “landing” another offence,
“removing” another offence, “transporting” another and “harbouring” still
another, and, accordingly, that the appellants were charged with six offences
in the alternative in the one count.

Mr. Justice Doull, with whom Mr. Justice Hall
concurred, says:—

The fallacy in this argument is that the
appellants were not charged with any one of the offences mentioned. They were
charged with an offence created by section 193  of the Customs Act , which,
leaving out irrelevant matter for the moment, provides that “Every person who
assists or is otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing or
removing or subsequent transportation or in the harbouring of such goods (i.e.,
goods liable to forfeiture under this Act), where the value of the goods so
imported, &c., is Two Hundred Dollars or over, shall be guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to a penalty not exceeding One Thousand
Dollars and not less than Two Hundred Dollars or to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding four years and not less than one year or to both fine and
imprisonment.

Section 193  creates a substantive offence,
and the guilt of a person charged thereunder depends in no degree whatever upon
the fact or otherwise that the acts in which such person is concerned are
themselves offences.

We agree with this view and we think it is
conclusive of the controversy. Section 854 of the Code applies. We agree
also with Mr. Justice Doull and Mr. Justice Hall that the form of the verdict
is unobjectionable when it is read in connection with the indictment and the
charge of the learned trial judge.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Charge of keeping common gaming house—Article
found on premises as constituting prima facie evidence of guilt—Cr. Code, ss.
985, 986 (2)—Nature of article—Prizes for punching in a board holes containing
“winning letters” contained in correct answers to printed questions—Possibility
of use of knowledge to punch with certainty correct holes—Difficult nature of
questions—Probable and contemplated manner of using the board—Sufficiency of
evidence to support magistrate’s finding against accused.

Appellant was convicted of keeping a common gaming house
contrary to s. 229 of the Cr. Code. Under a search warrant there was
seized in appellant’s drug store what was described as a “skill puzzle board”
containing (inter alia) a list of prizes, lists of numbered questions,
and rows (numbered correspondingly to the questions) of holes, the operator to
win a prize if he punched a hole containing a “winning letter” (which letter
would be in its proper place in the spelling of the answer, concealed under the
row of holes, to the correspondingly numbered question). It was stated that if
the operator knew the answer to a question he could make with certainty a
winning punch. It was apparent (as found by the court) that very few persons
who had not previously examined the questions and undertaken to search in books
of reference, etc., would know the answers. Appellant contended that, there
being only one correct answer to each question, there was no gaming or chance
connected with the operation of the board. The question on this appeal was
whether or not there was before the magistrate evidence sufficient in point of
law to support a finding that the article was a “means or contrivance for
playing any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or
betting” within s. 986 (2) of the Cr. Code.

Held: The conviction should be sustained. As applicable
to this appeal, the effect of ss. 985 and 986 (2), Cr. Code, was to
render it unnecessary for the prosecution to adduce evidence that persons had
resorted to appellant’s drug store for the purpose of using the board. As to
its manner of use: The court must apply its knowledge of the usual everyday
custom of mankind and hold that the ordinary person entering the store would
pay the sum required (10 cents) for the chance of winning a prize, without
critically examining the questions and returning later with a correct answer or
answers. It was quite apparent that it was never intended that the board would
be so used, but, on the contrary, it was expected that some persons entering
the store would be inveigled to pay for punching a hole and the chance of
winning a prize. This consideration sufficed to demonstrate that the board was
a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance or, at any rate, a mixed
game of chance and skill.

Per Duff C.J.: The magistrate was entitled to look at
the character of the questions and to consider the probability that people
participating in the game would seriously undergo the labour of ascertaining
the

[Page 428]

correct answers, as well as the probability that anybody
offering the game to people entering a public shop would expect that any such
thing would be done. The magistrate evidently concluded that, while the game
could be played as one involving research and with certain results, it would in
actual practice be operated in such a manner that the result, favourable or
unfavourable, would depend entirely upon luck, and that such was the
shopkeeper’s expectation. It could not be said that there was no evidence upon
which the magistrate, employing his knowledge as a man of the world, as it was
his duty to do, could take this view. It was an admissible conclusion, if the
magistrate was so satisfied, that there was no other reasonable explanation of
the proved facts. There was, therefore, evidence to support his finding that
the article was a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance and was
operated for gain by appellant.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] which
(Masten J.A. dissenting) dismissed his appeal from his conviction by a
magistrate of keeping a common gaming house, contrary to s. 229  of the Criminal
Code . The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the
judgments now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed.

L.M. Singer K.C. for the appellant.

C.L. Snyder K.C. and C.P. Hope K.C. for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE.—I have had the opportunity of reading the
judgment of Mr. Justice Kerwin in which I agree. I merely add that the controversy
turns upon the application of sections 985 and 986, Cr. C. Subsection 2
of section 986 is in the following terms:—

If any house, room or place is found fitted or provided with
any means or contrivance for playing any game of chance or any mixed game of
chance and skill, gaming or betting, or with any device for concealing,
removing or destroying such means or contrivance it shall be prima facie
evidence that such house, room or place is a common gaming house or common
betting house as the means or contrivance may indicate;

and the question we have to determine is whether or not there was
before the magistrate evidence sufficient in point of law to support a finding
that the article produced is a “means or contrivance for playing any game of
chance or any mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or betting.”

It is not disputed that the article was not in the shop for sale.
It is equally clear that it is a “means or contrivance for playing a game.” On
the payment of ten

[Page 429]

cents, the person desiring to participate in the game is
entitled, if he succeeds in punching a hole containing one of the winning
letters, to receive a prize specified as appertaining to that letter.

Mr. Singer argues that the game is not a “game of chance or a
mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or betting” because each of the
questions in the six columns has one and only one correct answer—which can be
ascertained; and if such correct answers are ascertained each one of the
winning letters will appear in one or more of them.

The magistrate was entitled to look at the character of the
questions and to consider the probability that people participating in this
game would seriously undergo the labour of ascertaining the correct answers to
these questions, as well as the probability that anybody offering this game to
people entering a public shop would expect that any such thing would be done.
The magistrate evidently came to the conclusion that, while the game could be
played as a game involving research and with certain results, it would,
nevertheless, in actual practice, be operated in such a manner that the result,
favourable or unfavourable, would depend entirely upon luck, and that such was
the expectation of the shopkeeper.

I find myself unable to hold that there was no evidence upon
which the magistrate, employing his knowledge as a man of the world, as it was
his duty to do, could take this view. It was an admissible conclusion, if the
magistrate was so satisfied, that there was no other reasonable explanation of
the proved facts. There was, therefore, evidence to support his finding that
the article produced was a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance
and was operated for gain by the appellant.

The judgment of Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was
delivered by

KERWIN, J.—The appellant was convicted of keeping a common gaming
house contrary to section 229  of the Criminal Code , and his conviction
was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario with Mr. Justice Masten
dissenting in the following words:—

My opinion in this case rests on the simple ground that
there is no evidence that this game has ever been played as a game of chance.
The

[Page 430]

accused is presumed innocent until proved guilty. So far as
appeared on the presentation of this case to this Court the evidence is, that
the device can be used and a successful result obtained with certainty
as a result of research and skill, but no evidence is afforded that it was ever
operated by any person as a game of chance.

For that reason I am of opinion that the prosecution fails.
I think the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.

By section 226 of the Code, a common gaming house is defined as

(a) a house, room or place kept by any person for
gain, to which persons resort for the purpose of playing at any game of chance,
or at any mixed game of chance and skill.

Section 985 provides as follows:—

When any cards, dice, balls, counters, tables or other
instruments of gaming used in playing any game of chance or any mixed game of
chance and skill are found in any house, room or place suspected to be used as
a common gaming house, and entered under a warrant or order issued under this
Act, or about the person of any of those who are found therein, it shall be prima
facie evidence, on the trial of a prosecution under section two hundred and
twenty-eight or section two hundred and twenty-nine, that such house, room or
place is used as a common gaming house, and that the persons found in the room
or place where such instruments of gaming are found were playing therein,
although no play was actually going on in the presence of the officer entering
the same under such warrant or order, or in the presence of the persons by whom
he is accompanied.

Subsection 2 of section 986 is important but in order to
understand the reference therein of the words “any house, room or place,” it is
necessary to quote also what is really subsection 1 although not so numbered.
These two subsections are as follows:—

In any prosecution under section two hundred and
twenty-eight or under section two hundred and twenty-nine it shall be prima
facie evidence that a house, room or place is a disorderly house if any
constable or officer authorized to enter any house, room or place is wilfully
prevented from or obstructed or delayed in entering the same, or any part
thereof.

2. If any house, room or place is found fitted or provided
with any means or contrivance for playing any game of chance or any mixed game
of chance and skill, gaming or betting, or with any device for concealing,
removing or destroying such means or contrivance, it shall be prima facie
evidence that such house, room or place is a common gaming house or common
betting house as the means or contrivance may indicate.

In this case a search warrant was obtained under section 641 of the
Code and in pursuance thereof a constable seized in the drug store
occupied by the accused what is described as a skill puzzle board. A list of
the prizes that might be won is given in large type on a piece of cardboard
attached

[Page 431]

at the top of the board itself, and on the latter appears the
following:—

Read explanation on
other side before punching.

WINNING LETTERS

The letter “J” wins a “Miracle Dry Shaver.”

The letters W, Z and F win a Genuine Ronson Lighter.

The following letters: QKMV win a Package (5’s) of Eastman
Thin Blades.

Last punch on board receives a “Miracle Dry Shaver.”

The words “Read explanation on other side before punching” are in
smaller type than any of the other printing. It is true that immediately above
what has been extracted the same words appear in heavy blue type on the
representation of the face of the board appearing in the case submitted to us,
but an examination of the board itself, filed as an exhibit, shows that the
list of prizes on the cardboard sheet is attached so as to cover this heavy
blue type. This is really of no importance in the view I take of the matter but
I think should be mentioned.

From a perusal of the explanation referred to, it appears that
the operator of the board would first be required to know the answer to one of
the questions contained in six columns. The answer consists of either a seven
or nine letter word, according to the column in which the question appears.
Below the lists of questions numbered from 1 to 12 is a series of holes similarly
numbered and the object of the operator would be to punch, with the instrument
attached to the board by a string, the particular hole which contains a strip
of paper upon which is printed one of the letters of the alphabet described as
“Winning Letters.” It is stated that the answer to each question is the only
correct, complete and precise answer to the correspondingly numbered and
situated question in the question portion of the board. I do not attach any
importance to the fact that the questions are printed on either a yellow or red
background and are somewhat difficult to read, but it is apparent, upon reading
the questions, that very few persons who had not previously examined them and
undertaken to search for the answers in books of reference, etc., would know
the correct response except perhaps in an isolated instance. Taking three
questions at random as examples, we find the following:—

7. Column 1. Wife of King Valentinian in Fletcher’s tragedy
of 1612.

8. Column 5. Speaker of the House of Commons who promoted
death of Mary, Queen of Scots.

[Page 432]

11. Column 5. Professor of comparative philology, 1868-1875,
at Oxford (Full name).

As applicable to this appeal, the effect of section 985 and
subsection 2 of 986 was to render it unnecessary for the prosecution to adduce
evidence that persons had resorted to the appellant’s drug store for the
purpose of using the board. The contention of the appellant is that, there
being only one correct answer to each question, there is no gaming or no chance
connected with the operation of the board. I think, however, we must apply our
knowledge of the usual everyday custom of mankind and hold that the ordinary
person entering the drug store would pay ten cents for the chance of winning a
prize, without critically examining the questions and returning later with the
correct answers to one or more of them. It is quite apparent that it was never
intended that the board would be so used but, on the contrary, it was expected
that some members of the public entering the drug store would be inveigled to
pay ten cents for the opportunity of punching a hole, and the chance of winning
a prize. This consideration is sufficient, in my opinion, to demonstrate that
the board is a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance or, at any
rate, a mixed game of chance and skill.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW
BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION

Criminal law—Evidence—Trial for
murder—Evidence of previous quarrels between accused and deceased with
accompanying assaults by accused —Admissibility.

The accused (respondent) was convicted at
trial of the murder of H., a girl
living near his home and with whom he had been “keeping company” for some time.
On March 30, “1938, accused and
H. were seen together and later on that day H. was found suffering from
injuries from which she died. Evidence was given of statements by accused,
after the alleged attack that he had killed H. with a hammer that he was “awful
jealous of her,” that he took her home the night previous and “afterwards she
ran out with another fellow.” Evidence was given, against objection, of
previous quarrels between accused and H. and accompanying assaults upon H. by
accused, one such incident occurring shortly before Christmas, 1937, one in January, 1938, and one about a week before said
March 30, 1938. The Appeal
Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (Harrison J. dissenting)
directed a new trial, on the ground that evidence of previous assaults by
accused upon H. was improperly admitted (13
M.P.R. 203). The Crown appealed.

Held (Kerwin
and Hudson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Duff C.J.,
Rinfret and Davis JJ.: The Crown’s case was that accused had killed H. in a fit
of jealous passion aroused by her conduct with another man. The evidence
definitely negatived any connection between this other man and the earlier
incidents now in question; and wholly failed to present any facts from which
the jury could properly infer that there was any connection of such earlier
incidents with accused’s objection to H.’s associating with other men; or that
such incidents were the result of enmity or ill-will on accused’s part; they
were transient ebullitions of annoyance and anger which immediately passed away
and led to nothing; in their physical characteristics they had no real
similarity to the attack of March 30. Where
there are acts seriously tending, when reasonably viewed, to establish motive
for a crime, evidence of such acts is admissible, not merely to prove intent,
but to prove the fact as well; but it is important that courts should not slip
into a habit of admitting evidence which, reasonably viewed, cannot tend to
prove motive or to explain the acts charged, merely because it discloses some
incident in the history of the relations of the parties. The incidents in
question did not appear to be such that they could reasonably be regarded as
evidencing feelings of enmity or ill-will which could have been the motive
actuating the homicide charged. A quarrel might, in its incidents or
circumstances or in its relation to other facts in evidence, have such a
character as

[Page 466]

to entitle the jury to infer motive and
intention and state of mind, even in the absence of verbal declaration; while,
on the other hand, such an occurrence or series of occurrences might be so
insignificant as to leave nothing for the jury to interpret and to afford no
reasonable basis for a relevant inference adverse to the accused. The facts in
each case must be looked at, and if, reasonably viewed, they have no probative
tendency favourable to the Crown or adverse to the accused in respect of the issue
joined between them, the evidence should be excluded.

Rex v. Bond,
[1906] 2 K.B. 389, at 397, 401, Rex v. Ball, [1911] A.C. 47,
at 68, and other oases, referred to. Theal v. The Queen, 7 Can.
S.C.R. 397, on its facts has no resemblance to the present case.

Per Kerwin J.
(dissenting): The intent of accused was directly in issue (Cr. Code, s.
259 (b) referred to), and it was for the Crown to adduce evidence
thereon. There was a definite connection between the accused’s acts
accompanying said quarrels and the issue as to accused’s intent in inflicting
the injuries on March 30; the evidence of those acts was relevant to that issue
as indicating a jealous disposition on accused’s part and as evidence of his
motive. The jury was entitled to take those matters into consideration in
conjunction with the other evidence, and the probative value was not so slight
that the evidence as to any of the quarrels was inadmissible.

Rex v. Bond,
[1906] 2 K.B. 389, at 397, 400, 401, Rex v. Ball, [1911] A.C.
47, at 68, Rex v. Shellaker, [1914] 1 K.B. 414, Rex v. Chomatsu
Yabu, 5 West. Australian L.R. 35, and other cases, referred to.

Per Hudson J.
(dissenting): The onus was on the Crown to establish that accused killed H. and
that he did it with malice. To satisfy that onus, recourse to circumstantial
evidence was necessary. Evidence of the previous relations of the parties,
including evidence of their quarrels and how they then behaved towards each
other, was relevant on the issue of malice as that issue is explained in Woolmington
v. The Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 462, at 482. The
evidence being relevant to an issue, it should not be excluded merely on the
ground that it disclosed some other crime or offence of a similar nature
committed by accused (Makin v. Attorney-General of New South Wales, [1894]
A.C. 57; Rex v. Bond, [1906] 2 K.B. 389).

APPEAL by the Attorney-General of New
Brunswick from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal
Division[1],
allowing (Harrison J. dissenting) the accused’s appeal against his conviction
for murder and ordering a new trial, on the ground that evidence given at the
trial of previous assaults by the accused upon the deceased was improperly
admitted. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the
judgments now reported; the evidence is dealt with in some considerable detail
in the judgment of Kerwin J. (dissenting). The appeal to this Court was
dismissed, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. dissenting.

the appellant.

P. J. Hughes K.C. for the
respondent.

The judgment of the majority of the Court (The
Chief Justice and Rinfret and Davis JJ.) was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—This appeal, in my view of it, does not raise
any question of general principle. As Lord Dunedin said in Thompson v. The
King[2]:—

the law of evidence in criminal cases is
really nothing more than a set of practical rules which experience has shown to
be best fitted to elicit the truth as to guilt without causing undue prejudice
to the prisoner.

It must not be forgotten that the jury are not
engaged in a scientific investigation. They are trying an issue of fact between
the Crown and the prisoner; and the court must see that the practical rules,
the purpose of which is thus explained by Lord Dunedin, are duly observed.

Nobody disputes that it is of the utmost
importance to

a prisoner charged with an offence * * *
that the facts laid before the jury should consist exclusively of the
transaction which forms the subject of the indictment which alone he can be
expected to come prepared to answer. It is, therefore, a general rule that the
facts proved must be strictly relevant to the particular charge and have no
reference to any conduct of the prisoner unconnected with such charge.

I am quoting from the judgment of Mr. Justice
Kennedy in Rex v. Bond[3].

While, as already observed, I do not consider
any question of general principle is really involved in this case, I do not
suggest for a moment that assistance in applying well known principles to the
facts may not be gained by consulting the authorities.

In Rex v. Ball[4] two people were indicted upon a charge of
incest. At the trial, evidence was admitted of previous acts of intercourse and
of the fact that they had been living in relations akin to those of husband and
wife. The House of Lords held these acts were admissible as tending to
establish the existence of a guilty passion at the very time the acts charged
were alleged to have been committed on the ground that

their passion for each other was as much
evidence as was their presence together in bed of the fact that when there they
had guilty relations with each other.

[Page 468]

In this Court, counsel for the Crown, who had
conducted the Crown’s case at the trial and who presented his argument with
conspicuous fairness, sustained the admissibility of the evidence objected to
on the strictly narrow ground that it was relevant to the issue of intent and
upon that alone. He expressly disclaimed the suggestion that the quarrels of
which evidence was given proceeded from hostility or enmity, or tended to show
the existence of such feelings. In his factum he contends that evidence of the
relations of the parties, friendly or unfriendly, is admissible without
qualification; but on the oral argument his contention was explicitly limited
as above explained and, it should be noticed, that this limitation is logically
inconsistent with any contention that the evidence tended to establish feelings
of hostility or malignity; a contention which, as observed, he explicitly
refused to adopt. The existence of such feelings would, as we shall see, be
relevant not merely in respect of intent, but in respect of the fact as well.
The evidence adduced by the Crown was inconsistent with the notion that
anything like a feeling of ill-will or malignity actuated these quarrels; and,
indeed, as the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick intimates, they were
transient ebullitions of annoyance and anger on the part of the accused which
immediately passed away and led to nothing.

The Crown’s case was in truth that the accused
had killed the deceased in a fit of jealous passion aroused by her conduct with
another man. There is nothing in the evidence to show that the accused was
aware even of the existence of this man before the last of the incidents in question,
although he had first become acquainted with the deceased, according to his own
evidence, about two weeks before that. The evidence definitely negatives any
connection between him and the earlier incidents. It seems reasonable to infer
from counsel’s opening that he expected to connect all the incidents now in
question with the accused’s objection to the victim’s associating with other
men; but the evidence wholly fails to present any facts from which the jury
could properly infer that there was any such connection. It is true there is a
general statement, elicited in re-examination from one of the witnesses by
leading questions, to the effect that the accused objected

[Page 469]

to her going with other men and that he was a
little “jealous” of her. But there is no evidence which would have entitled the
trial judge to instruct the jury that they might ascribe these quarrels to any
such feeling. Indeed, as regards the first of the quarrels, the evidence of the
witness for the Crown who related the facts is explicit that the quarrel had a
totally different origin. There is no suggestion in the record, it should be
added, from the beginning to the end of the trial that these incidents were the
result of enmity or ill-will on the part of the accused.

If you have acts seriously tending, when
reasonably viewed, to establish motive for the commission of a crime, then
there can be no doubt that such evidence is admissible, not merely to prove
intent, but to prove the fact as well. But I think, with the greatest possible
respect, it is rather important that the courts should not slip into a habit of
admitting evidence which, reasonably viewed, cannot tend to prove motive or to
explain the acts charged merely because it discloses some incident in the
history of the relations of the parties.

In the course of the argument in Rex v. Ball
(1), Lord Atkinson said:—

Surely in an ordinary prosecution for
murder you can prove previous acts or words of the accused to shew he
entertained feelings of enmity towards the deceased, and that is evidence not
merely of the malicious mind with which he killed the deceased, but of the fact
that he killed him. You can give in evidence the enmity of the accused towards
the deceased to prove that the accused took the deceased’s life. Evidence of
motive necessarily goes to prove the fact of the homicide by the accused, as
well as his “malice aforethought” * * *

Of course, a much wider latitude is allowed the
accused, who may adduce any evidence, of good character for example, tending to
show, not only that it was not likely that he committed the crime charged but
that he was not the kind of person likely to do so.

In Rex v. Ball[5], Lord Loreburn quoted the following passage
from the judgment of Kennedy J. in Rex v. Bond[6]:—

The relations of the murdered or injured
man to his assailant, so far as they may reasonably be treated as explanatory
of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment, are properly
admitted to proof as integral parts of the history of the alleged crime for
which the accused is on his trial.

It is most important to attend to the
qualification “so

[Page 470]

far as they may reasonably be treated as
explanatory of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment.” It
explains, I think, why Cresswell J. and Williams J. in Mobbs’ case[7] were not satisfied of the admissibility of
evidence of conduct of the accused directed towards the deceased eleven days
before the date of the alleged murder in the absence of some accompanying
declaration, even as tending to prove malice.

In Theal v. The Queen[8], counsel for the Crown in opening (p. 399)
stated he would prove systematic ill-treatment culminating in the final assault
which was the immediate cause of the victim’s death. The previous acts of
violence were held admissible as tending to establish intent and as in the same
category as deliberate menaces or threats tending to prove malice and intent (per
Ritchie C.J. at p. 406). The judgment must be interpreted in light of the
facts and especially of the character of the previous assaults proved and the
threats accompanying them. The case has no sort of resemblance to that before
us.

By way of summary, it may perhaps be added that,
first of all, the incidents in question do not appear to be such that they
could reasonably be regarded as evidencing feelings of enmity or ill-will which
could have been the motive actuating the homicide charged. I do not doubt that
a quarrel might in its incidents or circumstances, or in its relation to other
facts in evidence, have such a character as to entitle the jury to infer motive
and intention and state of mind, even in the absence of verbal declaration;
while, on the other hand, such an occurrence or series of occurrences might be
so insignificant as to leave nothing for the jury to interpret and to afford no
reasonable basis for a relevant inference adverse to the accused. The facts in
each case must be looked at, and if, reasonably viewed, they have no probative
tendency favourable to the Crown or adverse to the prisoner in respect of the
issue joined between them, it is the duty of the court to exclude the evidence.
The responsibility of the judge in such cases is a grave one if there is any
risk that the evidence tendered may prejudice the prisoner.

Having regard to the character of the case made
at the trial, the course of the trial, and the position taken by

[Page 471]

counsel for the Crown in this court, it would be
unsafe to set aside the order for a new trial pronounced by the Supreme Court
of New Brunswick on any such hypothesis as to the origin and nature of these
incidents.

For the same reason it would be equally unsafe
to proceed upon the proposition that evidence of these incidents was admissible
as relevant to the issue of intent as evidence of similar acts calculated to
negative accident or mistake or tending directly to prove that the acts of the
30th of March were committed with the intent to kill. In view of the relations
of the parties it is questionable if what occurred on any one of the occasions
dealt with by Mr. Justice Harrison amounted even technically to an assault; in
any event, the Crown, as already observed, refused to impute to the accused
ill-will and there is no suggestion that there was any intention to harm; in
their physical characteristics there is no real similarity between these
quarrels and the murderous attack of March 30th.

Nor is there any evidence from which the jury
could reasonably ascribe the conduct of the accused on these isolated occasions
to the motive alleged to have prompted the acts of March 30th—resentment
against the association of the deceased with other men.

The appear should be dismissed.

Kerwin J. (dissenting)—Robert Barbour was convicted of having murdered
Margaret Harris on March 30th, 1938. The Appeal Division of the Supreme Court
of New Brunswick[9]
directed a new trial on the ground that evidence given that the accused had
previously assaulted the deceased was improperly admitted. Mr. Justice Harrison
dissented and the Attorney-General now appeals to this Court upon the question
of law upon which such dissent was based.

Upon an examination of the residuum of the
evidence there would appear to be no dispute as to the following facts. The
accused and Margaret Harris had been “keeping company” for some time. (I refer
immediately to what transpired on the evening of March 29th, 1938, because
while there was a suggestion that the evidence on the point is of a “previous
assault,” it was not so urged

[Page 472]

before us by counsel for the accused and in fact
I do not understand how that proposition could be seriously advanced). On the
evening, then, of March 29th the accused brought Margaret to her home and
shoved her through the doorway, saying to her mother, “keep her home, she is
running around too much.” On March 30th, the accused and Margaret were seen
together,—the latter sitting on the former’s knee and the accused crying.
Shortly thereafter the girl was discovered in the same house bleeding and
suffering from injuries inflicted by a hammer. The same day the accused went to
the shire gaol and gave himself into custody. Upon arrival at the buildings he
met Napoleon Leger and said to him: “My name is Robert Barbour, son of John
Barbour. * * * I have just killed my lady friend.” After being incarcerated, he
made a certain statement in the presence of two prisoners. One of them, Wilmot,
gives the statement as follows: “I just committed murder about ten minutes ago.
* * * Yes, that is right—I just killed my girl with a hammer.” Upon Wilmot
remarking: “How in the name of God did that happen?” the accused continued,
according to Wilmot: “I was awful jealous of her— I took her out last night— I
took her home— Afterwards she ran out with another fellow— She came over to the
house to-day and I killed her.” The other prisoner, Darbison, testified: “He (meaning
the accused) said he had killed a girl—had hit her on the head with a hammer. *
* * He said he took her home the night previous and he was terribly jealous of
her.” As a result of the injuries sustained on March 30th, Margaret died on
April 15th.

The issues to be determined by the jury were
whether the accused had inflicted the injuries from which the girl died, and
under clause (b) of section 259 of the Code, whether he had meant
to cause her any bodily injury which was known to him to be likely to cause
death and was careless whether death ensued or not. That is, the intent of the
accused was directly in issue and the responsibility devolved upon the Crown to
adduce evidence on that point. Evidence as to any motive the accused might have
had in inflicting the injuries spoken of in the Code was directly
relevant to that issue of intent. While the Crown is not obliged to adduce
evidence of motive, the presence

[Page 473]

or absence of motive may be of very considerable
importance. If the evidence before the jury disclosed merely that the girl had
received injuries and that the accused had caused those injuries, the case
would have been left in a very unsatisfactory position, and hence it was that
evidence of what the accused said to Leger and to the two prisoners was
tendered, not merely to indicate that the accused had inflicted the injuries
but as to his motive in so doing.

How, then, does the matter stand with reference
to the evidence of previous assaults which the Court of Appeal has determined
was improperly admitted? In his opening address to the jury, after stating that
the accused had been keeping company with Margaret Harris and after referring
to one Robert MacPherson, who “comes into the scene on March 29th,” and after
referring to the evidence to be adduced that on the evening of that day the
accused had pushed Margaret through the doorway saying something to this
effect: “Keep her home. She is running around too much,” Crown counsel
continued, according to the transcript on page 40 of the Appeal Case, as
follows:—

Now there is evidence also to be submitted
here that the accused and his girl friend, sweetheart if you like, have not
been getting along very well lately. Evidence to show that there had been some
quarrelling. Now what the reasons for the quarrels are you will have to have
some evidence before you what was bring that about. What was the trouble. What
he was crying about that day. Why his mysterious movements on the day before
and why his mysterious actions in the house that afternoon of the fatal day,
March 30th.

During the course of the trial this evidence as
to quarrelling was adduced:—

(1) The evidence of Frances Barbour, a sister of
the accused. After the objection of counsel for the accused had been
over-ruled, the questions and answers proceeded:

Q. I would ask you the question, prior to
March 30th shortly prior to March 30th, did you ever see Robert Barbour, your
brother, and Margaret Harris quarrelling?

A. Yes.

Q. About how long before March 30th?

A. About a week.

Q. Where was this quarrel you saw? Where
did it take place?

A. In the Barbour house.

Q. In your own house?

A. Yes.

Q. In what room in your own house?

A. In the living room.

[Page 474]

Q. Tell us what you saw on that occasion?

A. Margaret and Robert were sitting down, they
were quarrelling. They were talking about something. I didn’t hear. Robert
jumped up and started hitting Margaret.

Court: He jumped up?

A. Yes.

Court: And did what?

A. Hit Margaret.

Court: He hit Margaret?

A. Yes, Margaret went into the bed room and
Robert went out.

Q. Margaret went into the bed room?

A. Yes.

Q. And Robert went out doors?

A. Yes.

Q. How many times did he hit her and how
did he hit her?

A. He hit her with his hand.

Q. Do you know whether it was his clenched
hand or open hand?

A. I didn’t take notice.

Q. What stopped the quarrel?

A. My sister-in-law stopped it.

Q. Your sister-in-law?

A. Yes.

Q. That is Mrs. Richard Barbour?

A. Yes.

Q. How did she stop them?

A. Came and parted them.

Q. What did you do yourself in that case?

A. I called for Mrs. Galley.

Q. Where is Mrs. Galley?

A. In the same building we are in.

Q. In the rear part of your house, is that
right?

A. Yes.

In cross-examination the witness was asked and
answered as follows:—

Q. You say your brother Robert, the
accused, and Margaret Harris went out together a great deal?

A. Yes.

Q. As a matter of fact, he was very fond of
her?

A. Yes.

* *
*

Q. Isn’t it true that Margaret Harris was
inclined to tease Robert?

A. Yes.

Q. You said yes?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you know whether or not she was teasing
him on the occasion you spoke of, that you were telling Mr. McLatchey of?

A. No, she was not.

(2) The evidence of Mrs. Richard Barbour, a
sister of Margaret Harris, which on this point appears at pages 160 to 165 of
the Case. After an objection had been overruled, this witness testified that
she had seen the accused and Margaret quarreling on three occasions. The first
was shortly prior to the preceding Christmas; the accused wanted

[Page 475]

Margaret to go to her own home and kicked her;
the witness stopped this quarrel. The next occasion was about January of 1938
and while the witness could not state the reason for the quarrel, she saw the
accused strike Margaret once or twice over the shoulder with his open hand; the
parties to the quarrel stopped of their own accord. The third occasion was a
week before March 30th and is the same one already spoken of by Frances
Barbour. On cross-examination the witness admitted that the accused and
Margaret had been keeping company for a long time; that they seemed to be fond
of each other; that Margaret was inclined to tease the accused from time to
time “for fun,” and that they would have “spats”; that when they were
quarrelling on the two latter occasions spoken of by this witness “it would be
one of those spats”; that they would generally “make up right after and go on
as they had before”; and that on the first occasion spoken of by the witness,
the accused wanted Margaret to go to her own home so that he might go to bed to
be rested for his work in the morning. On re-examination the following
occurred, as reported on page 184 of the Case:—

Q. Was Robert jealous about Margaret?

A. He appeared to be a little.

Q. Did he object to her going around with
other men?

Mr. Hughes:
Just a moment—I object.

Question allowed.

A. Yes, he did.

Cross-examination on these questions—Mr.
Hughes.

Q. Mrs. Barbour, you said Robert appeared
to be a little jealous of Margaret?

A. Yes.

Q. He seemed, as you have already said, to
be very fond of her?

A. Yes.

Q. And you thought he wanted to marry her,
I take it? Mr. McLatchey: She
didn’t say that.

Q. That would be correct, would it not?

A. Well, I don’t know.

Q. Well, that was the impression you
gathered from their relationship, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And that if he thought he was likely to
lose her he appeared to be jealous, that is what you thought?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did he not appear to be trying to
protect her?

A. I don’t know.

Q. Have you not seen indications of that?

A. No, I have not.

[Page 476]

Q. Did he not try to keep her from going to
places that he thought she should not go to?

A. Well, I don’t know anything about that.

(3) The evidence of John Harris, Margaret’s
father, who testified that in January of 1938 he had had a conversation with
the accused and had told the accused “Margaret had two black eyes and I asked
him what was the meaning of it and he did not give me any answer.” The witness
testified further that on March 29th “he (the accused) told me, he said ‘I will
never lay hands on Margaret again’ and he made a promise and I took him up on
it and we shook hands on it.” On cross-examination the witness testified that
the accused had not admitted that he (the accused) was responsible for the
blackening of Margaret’s eyes.

The only reference in the judge’s charge to the
jury as to the accused having struck or kicked Margaret is at page 450 of the
Case, and it was introduced in connection with the judge’s instructions on the
question of the accused’s insanity, which had also been raised. The learned
judge had discussed this question at some length and then said:—

Let us see what turns here:

We have been told that the accused and this
girl were very friendly. I do not know whether they were lovers or not, but
they had been going around together for three or four years. There is evidence also
that he had kicked her. There is evidence that he hit her. There is evidence
that on the 29th of March he had, that before Margaret Harris was found wounded
or injured in the Barbour house, that he had told Margaret’s father that he
wouldn’t ever lay a hand on her again. So that you compare that with the
situation I have given you, of a father coming in and telling you that he had
killed his child.

The judge immediately continued with his
instruction upon the question of insanity. At page 444 he is reported to have
spoken “of the reference to the fact that Margaret was teasing the accused” and
to have pointed out that it appeared to him that it was introduced for no
reason except to suggest provocation, as to which the judge intimated there was
no evidence.

I have mentioned in detail the only evidence of
previous assaults and have shown how that evidence was introduced and led at
the trial. The manner in which it was dealt with by the trial judge and Crown
counsel cannot, of course, cure the defect, if in truth it was not proper to
place it before the jury, as the objection is to its admissibility and not to
the weight to be attached to

[Page 477]

it. However, it is apparent that it was never
suggested that such evidence was submitted for the purpose of showing the
accused had committed another offence, or that he was a person who was likely
to mean to cause to the deceased an injury known to the accused to be likely to
cause death, or as evidence of similar acts; but on the ground that it was some
evidence of a motive,—particularly when considered in conjunction with the
evidence as to what transpired on the evening of March 29th and the evidence as
to the statements made by the accused on March 30th to Leger and the two
prisoners.

On the argument the case of Rex v. Bond[10] was relied upon by counsel for the
respondent and we were particularly pressed with the applicability of the
judgment of Lord Justice Kennedy. In Rex v. Ball[11], counsel for the accused, during the
course of his argument before the House of Lords, referred to that part of the
judgment of Lord Justice Kennedy at page 397 in the Bond case10,
but later the Lord Chancellor quoted another part of the same judgment at page
401:—

The relations of the murdered or injured
man to his assailant, so far as they may reasonably be treated as explanatory
of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment, are properly
admitted to proof as integral parts of the history of the alleged crime for
which the accused is on his trial.

Upon counsel remarking:—

That is because, in murder, you have the
act, and then the question of what was in the mind of the assailant.

Lord Atkinson then interposed:—

Surely in an ordinary prosecution for
murder you can prove previous acts or words of the accused to shew he entertained
feelings of enmity towards the deceased, and that is evidence not merely of the
malicious mind with which he killed the deceased, but of the fact that he
killed him. You can give in evidence the enmity of the accused towards the
deceased to prove that the accused took the deceased’s life. Evidence of motive
necessarily goes to prove the fact of the homicide by the accused, as well as
his “malice aforethought,” inasmuch as it is more probable that men are killed
by those who have some motive for killing them than by those who have not.

It is true that the circumstances in the Ball
case[12] were
peculiar but in The King v. Shellaker[13] Sir Rufus Isaacs, Lord Chief Justice of
England, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, which
included Channell,

[Page 478]

Bray, Avory and Lush, JJ., pointed out that the Ball
case[14]
followed a long line of authorities of which Reg. v. Ollis[15] was one. The rule propounded by Channell
J. in the latter was adopted wherein he stated that in such cases evidence of
other transactions is admitted not for the purpose of showing that the prisoner
committed other offences but for the purpose of showing that the transaction in
question was done with the intent to defraud or with guilty knowledge, as the
case may be. The Ollis case[16] is
again referred to, as well as the Shellaker case[17], in Rex v. Love-grove[18], another judgment of the Court of Criminal
Appeal (the Earl of Reading, L.C.J., Salter and Acton JJ.) delivered by the
Lord Chief Justice.

These decisions show, if any authority be
needed, that the Bond case[19], and
particularly the judgment relied upon, cannot be taken as setting forth the
only circumstances under which prior offences of an accused may be disclosed on
his trial. In fact, Lord Justice Kennedy enunciated several general rules,
i.e., (1) “evidence must be confined to the point in issue” and (2) “the facts
proved must be strictly relevant to the particular charge and have no reference
to any conduct of the prisoner unconnected with such charge” (page 397). As to
these rules, it will be noticed that the Lord Justice refers to the “point in
issue” and to “conduct of the prisoner unconnected with such charge,” and later
at page 400 points out that it is not easy to say whether a particular case
falls within the (second) rule or within the apparent exceptions.

In Reg. v. Mobbs[20], it is reported in (1853) 6 Cox C.C. 223
and in 17 J.P. 713, that Baron Cresswell and Williams J., in a case where
evidence was offered of a prior assault, felt so uncertain about the matter
that they decided not to admit the evidence. These reports are very meagre but
in 38 Central Criminal Court Reports, 651, which purports to give the
proceedings as they occurred, no reference is made to a ruling by the judges.
From this report it appears that upon counsel for the accused objecting to the
question, “What did you then see the prisoner do to his wife?” and stating that
such evidence did not 

[Page 479]

explain the difference between murder and
manslaughter, which was the only argument open to him, Mr. Bodkin for the Crown
indicated “that he did not purpose to prove any expressions accompanying the
acts but only the acts themselves; that it was not consistent with his duty to
omit all mention of the matter, but having done so, he would now withdraw the
question.”

Whichever report of Reg. v. Mobbs[21] is correct, it is apparent that the case
cannot be considered a precedent to apply to other cases where, either a prior
act of the accused is accompanied by a statement of his, or where there are other
acts of his that a jury might consider in conjunction with such prior act. And
this view was taken in Rex v. Chomatsu Yabu[22]. It was there held, on an appeal from a
conviction of a man for having murdered a Japanese woman, that evidence was
rightly admitted that at a date some time earlier than the date of the alleged
offence the accused was in a yard behind the house of the woman and in answer
to her accusation admitted that he had broken up her furniture. McMillan J.
stated:—

I think if facts can be found from which
the jury can properly infer what the motive and intention and state of mind of
prisoner was, that those facts are as properly brought before them as any
declaration on the part of the prisoner would have been.

At the famous trial of William Palmer, 1856[23], one question was as to whether the
accused administered the poison. After referring to the practice in some
countries of allowing a probability to be raised that an accused has committed
an offence by showing that he has committed other offences, Lord Campbell
instructed the jury that by the law of England every man is presumed to be
innocent and that it allowed his guilt to be established only by evidence
directly connected with the charge. He then referred to circumstantial evidence
leading to the conclusion of guilt, stating that with respect to the alleged
motive “it is of great importance to see whether there was a motive for
committing such a crime” and concluded that the adequacy of the motive was of
little importance.

[Page 480]

In the case at bar, it is doubtful, in my
opinion, in view of the relations between the accused and Margaret Harris, if
the striking and kicking may be termed offences in any sense of the word. In
any event, for the reasons already indicated, I believe there was a definite
connection between those acts, accompanying, as they did, the quarrels
mentioned, and the issue as to the accused’s intent in inflicting the injuries
on Margaret Harris on March 30th, 1938. The evidence of these acts was relevant
to that issue as indicating a jealous disposition on the part of the accused
and as evidence of the accused’s motive.

In connection with the four episodes, it is well
to bear in mind the relationship between the Harris and Barbour families and
just who the witnesses were who testified. Mrs. Richard Barbour was not only
the sister of Margaret Harris but was also married to a brother of the accused.
Frances Barbour was a sister of the accused; and John Harris, besides being the
father of Margaret Harris, was, of course, the father-in-law of his other
daughter’s husband. As to the first occasion, Mrs. Richard Barbour did testify
on cross-examination, as has been noted, that the accused wanted Margaret to go
to her home so that he might go to bed to be rested for his work. In view of
the fact that this testimony was given by answering “Yes” to a series of
suggestions by counsel for the accused (put by him with perfect propriety), the
jury would be entitled to weigh such answers and give such effect to them, if
any, as they saw fit. The jury was entitled to take all these matters into
consideration in conjunction with the other evidence and I cannot agree that
the probative value is so slight that the evidence as to any of the quarrels
was inadmissible. The trial judge admitted the evidence and, in my opinion,
should not have ruled otherwise.

Notwithstanding that the appellant is restricted
upon his appeal to the question of law upon which there has been dissent in the
court below, it was submitted on behalf of the accused that the latter is not
to be deprived of the new trial granted him unless this Court is satisfied, in
making such order “as the justice of the case requires” (section 1024,
subsection 1), that no error exists in connection with any of the other grounds
taken by the accused before the Court of Appeal. We accordingly heard 

[Page 481]

argument on all questions that counsel for the
accused desired to raise. It is unnecessary for me to express an opinion on any
of these questions or on the point of jurisdiction, since the majority of the
Court have come to the conclusion that the appeal of the Attorney-General
fails.

Hudson J. (dissenting)—The
only point: on which there was dissent in the court below is that “there was
error in admitting the evidence of previous assaults by the accused upon
Margaret Harris.”

The prisoner was charged with murder and pleaded
not guilty. The duty of the Crown in such a case is stated by the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Sankey, in the case of Woolmington v. The
Director of Public Prosecutions[24], as follows:—

When dealing with a murder case the Crown
must prove (a) death as the result of a voluntary act of the accused and
(b) malice of the accused. It may prove malice either expressly or by
implication. For malice may be implied where death occurs as the result of a
voluntary act of the accused which is (i) intentional and (ii) unprovoked. When
evidence of death and malice has been given (this is a question for the jury)
the accused is entitled to show, by evidence or by examination of the circumstances
adduced by the Crown that the act on his part which caused death was either
unintentional or provoked.

The onus then was on the Crown to establish that
the prisoner killed the deceased and that he did it with malice. To satisfy
this onus, recourse to circumstantial evidence was necessary. The questions
immediately arose: What were the previous relations between the parties? Were
they friends or otherwise? If friends, how friendly? How did they normally
behave towards each other? What were their normal acts and ordinary doings?

I am of opinion that evidence in this case of
the previous relations of the parties, including evidence of their quarrels and
how they then behaved towards each other, was relevant on the issue of malice
as above defined by the House of Lords.

If the evidence was relevant to any issue, then
I can find no authority to justify the exclusion of such evidence merely on the
ground that it disclosed some other crime or offence of a similar nature
committed by the accused. The decision of the Privy Council in Makin v. Attorney-General
for New South Wales[25], and
of the Court of Appeal in The King v. Bond[26], sufficiently establish this.

[Page 482]

For these reasons, I agree on this point with
the conclusion of Mr. Justice Harrison who dissented in the court below.

As the majority of this Court has come to the
conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed, it is unnecessary for me to
express an opinion on the question of jurisdiction or on the other points
raised on behalf of the prisoner.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Conspiracy—Duress—Action for alleged
obtaining of property by threat of criminal prosecution—Jury’s findings—Ground
of action—Substance of the claim—Remedy.

Plaintiff, who had been the general manager
and a shareholder of a company, alleged that defendants, one of whom: was the
president and a large shareholder of the company, entered into an unlawful
conspiracy to obtain from him a transfer of his shares in the company by threats
of criminal prosecution; that pursuant to the conspiracy defendants made such
threats and, induced thereby, he delivered to defendants a transfer of the
shares as demanded; and he claimed recovery of their value. Defendants denied
plaintiff’s allegations and they alleged breaches of duty in plaintiff’s
management of the company, resulting in loss to it, and that plaintiff
surrendered his shares in satisfaction of claims on behalf of the company for
such loss. At the trial two totally different stories in the evidence went to
the jury, who, in answers to questions submitted, found in favour of
plaintiff’s allegations. Judgment was given to plaintiff for the amount awarded
as damages by the jury, being the value of the shares plus interest. An appeal
by defendants to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan was dismissed, [1938] 1
W.W.R. 241. Defendants appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per The Chief
Justice, Crocket and Davis JJ.: There was evidence to justify the jury’s
findings. These findings were in effect that there was an intentional design on
defendants’ part to obtain from plaintiff, without any valuable consideration,
a transfer of his shares and that

[Page 236]

the same was demanded and obtained by menaces
and illegal extortion. This was quite sufficient to answer the argument that a
mere threat in itself is not unlawful. A threat to prosecute may not of itself
be illegal where a just debt actually exists and where the transaction between
the parties involves a civil liability as well as, possibly, a criminal act (Flower
v. Sadler, 10 Q.B.D. 572, at 576). Here the findings plainly
negatived defendants’ story that the transaction was merely the legitimate
compromise of a claim for damages for breach of duty. Moreover, no question of
plaintiff’s civil liability to the company set up by defendants was asked of
the jury and defendants had no finding that there was any such liability.

Per Davis J.:
Remarks with regard to conspiracy as a ground of action. Inclination expressed
to the opinion that civil conspiracy is not properly applicable to cases where
physical property is sought to be recovered on the ground of duress and is
really only relevant in cases of general or undefined rights, such as a right
to trade, as distinguished from defined rights, such as the right to property.
Doubt expressed whether the present, case properly lies in conspiracy. But,
whether or not plaintiff’s remedy was properly laid as an action in conspiracy,
the substance of the claim was that plaintiff had been maliciously and
unlawfully deprived of his property by duress and coercion on defendant’s part;
that was the issue that was contested at the trial and that was the issue that
really went to the jury.

Kerwin and Hudson JJ. adopted the reasons of
Mackenzie J.A. in the Court of Appeal, [1938] 1 W.W.R. at 244-260.

APPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1]
dismissing their appeal from the judgment of Taylor J., on the verdict of a
jury, that the plaintiff recover from the defendants the sum of $26,840 and
interest.

The action was brought to recover from the
defendants the value of certain shares of stock in the Reliance Lumber Co. Ltd.
The plaintiff had been the owner of the said shares; and he alleged that
defendants entered into an unlawful conspiracy to obtain from him a transfer of
said shares by threats of criminal prosecution; that pursuant to the conspiracy
the defendants threatened to institute criminal proceedings against him unless
he would transfer the shares to them; that, induced by said threats, he
delivered to defendants a transfer of the shares, defendants obtained
possession of the share certificates and had ever since been in possession of
the same.

The plaintiff had been the general manager,
and the defendant Stoltze was the president, of said company. The other
defendants were employees of Stoltze and as such had made certain
investigations into the affairs of the company.

[Page 237]

In their defence the defendants denied
plaintiff’s allegations, and they alleged breaches of duty in plaintiff’s
management of the company, as a result of which, it was alleged, the company
lost large sums of money and suffered and would suffer loss of profits, which
the plaintiff became liable to repay and make good to the company, and that
plaintiff agreed to surrender his shares to the company in full satisfaction of
all claims of the company against him in respect of the aforesaid matters, and
did so, delivering the share certificates endorsed in blank, and that the shares
were now held by or on behalf of the company.

Defendants’ allegations were denied by
plaintiff.

The delivery of the share certificates
(endorsed in blank), and also the resignation of the plaintiff as general
manager of the company, took place immediately after a certain interview
between the defendants and the plaintiff. Conflicting accounts of what was said
at that interview were given at the trial.

The evidence is discussed at some length in
the judgment of Davis J. in this Court, now reported, and also in the judgment
of Mackenzie J.A. in the Court of Appeal[2].

At the trial the jury found in favour of the
plaintiff. The questions submitted and the jury’s answers thereto were as
follows:

1. Did the plaintiff receive any valuable
consideration for the transfer of his interest in his shares in the Reliance
Lumber Company Limited referred to in the memorandum of agreement dated March
16th, 1936.

Answer: No.

2. Did the defendants, on or about the 16th
day of March, 1936, enter into a conspiracy to obtain a transfer of the
plaintiff’s shares of the capital stock of the Reliance Lumber Company Limited
by threats of criminal prosecution of the plaintiff?

Answer: Yes.

3. If you so find, did the defendants,
pursuant to the said conspiracy, threaten to criminally prosecute the
plaintiff?

Answer: Yes.

4. And if you find in the affirmative in
answering questions 2 and 3 was the plaintiff induced by the said threat to
transfer and deliver his said shares in the said company to the defendants?

Answer: Yes.

[Page 238]

5. Assess the damage sustained by the
plaintiff in consequence of the said conspiracy, if you have so found.

Answer: $26,840, plus interest at legal rate
(from) March 16th, 1936.

6. Did the defendants agree not to prosecute
the plaintiff?

Answer: Yes, by implication.

The trial judge directed that judgment be
entered for the plaintiff for the amount, with interest, as awarded by the
jury. The defendants appealed from the verdict and findings of the jury and
from the said judgment to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal[3], and defendants appealed to this Court. By
the judgment of this Court, now reported, the appeal was dismissed with costs.

F. L. Bastedo K.C. for the appellants.

G. H. Yule K.C. and R. L. Winton for the
respondent.

The Chief
Justice.—I do not desire to lay down any rule of
general application as to the scope of actions founded on conspiracy. Subject
to that, I concur with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Davis.

Crocket, J.—Subject to the same reservation as that indicated in the
learned Chief Justice’s memorandum, I concur in the judgment of my brother
Davis.

Davis, J.—From some time in the year 1909 until March 16th, 1936, the
respondent Fuller had been the general manager of the Reliance Lumber Company,
Limited, a Dominion company with head office at Saskatoon in the province of
Saskatchewan and with an executive office in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A. The
company carried on a retail lumber business in the province of Saskatchewan and
had in March, 1936, about thirty lumber yards, mostly in the northern part of
the province. The respondent resided in Saskatoon. The appellant Stoltze is the
President of the Company and resides in St. Paul, Minnesota. His father, now
deceased, had owned nine-tenths of the capital stock of the company and the
respondent the other one-tenth. On the death of his father in 1928, the
appellant Stoltze and his wife became the owners of, and still hold,
nine-tenths of the stock of the company. The respondent remained the owner of
the other one-tenth of the stock

[Page 239]

of the company. Stoltze’s co-appellants, Kemper
and Hadrath, also reside in St. Paul, Minnesota, and were requested by Stoltze
in February, 1936, to investigate for him certain charges of mismanagement
against the respondent in respect of the company’s affairs that had been
reported to Stoltze by one Davies. Hadrath was in the employ of Stoltze, having
done both clerical and executive work for some years for him in connection with
different companies with which Stoltze was connected. Stoltze described Hadrath
as his “confidential man—what in the United States we call in slang a trouble
shooter. When something goes wrong I send him down to attend to it; if there is
a problem before me, I ask him to look into it.” Stoltze admitted that Hadrath
had no special knowledge of the business of the Reliance Lumber Company. Kemper
was an uncle of Stoltze’s wife and had been assisting Stoltze in his office in
St. Paul. Stoltze said he trusted him entirely but “he had no particular
qualifications for this work.”—that is, of investigating the affairs of the
Reliance Lumber Company. Neither Hadrath nor Kemper appear to have had any
shares in the company.

On March 16th, 1936, the respondent turned over
to the appellant Stoltze all his shares in the company and resigned as
secretary, general manager and a director of the company. His shares were
admitted to be worth $30,000 and there is no question that they were his own
property. The share certificates, immediately prior to their delivery to
Stoltze, were in the Dominion Bank at Saskatoon, collateral to loans to the
respondent of $3,160. This amount the company paid to the Bank in order to
release the security. On April 2nd, 1936, the respondent by his solicitor
demanded from the appellant Stoltze the immediate reassignment and delivery to
the respondent of the share certificates in question, or their value, his
contention being that the transfer of the shares had been obtained by duress,
in the form of threats of prosecution. This action by the respondent against
the appellants Stoltze, Kemper and Hadrath followed the refusal of Stoltze to
return the share certificates.

Two totally different stories were given to the
jury. The evidence on behalf of the appellants (defendants) was that at a
meeting of the four persons, parties to this action, in the company’s office in
Saskatoon on the said

[Page 240]

March 16th, 1936, the affairs of the company
were discussed for about an hour; charges of mismanagement and breach of duty
by the respondent as general manager of the company were made on the basis that
the respondent had caused the company great loss by buying lumber through the
medium of his son, so that his son would get a commission; that after the
respondent had asked what he could do or should do about the “mess” that
Stoltze had told him he had got the company into, Stoltze suggested to the
respondent that he might turn in his stock in reparation; and that the
respondent agreed to do that. Stoltze said at the trial that his understanding
was that the respondent was voluntarily turning over the stock in reparation of
the damage he had permitted to be done to the company and that he, Stoltze,
believed the turning over of the stock would be an equitable solution because
he was satisfied that the losses were much greater than the value of the stock.

The respondent’s story was that on returning
from a western business trip he was summoned to his office at the company’s
head office by telephone on the day in question, March 16th, 1936, and found
the three appellants there; they had Changed the lock on the door of his office
before his arrival; they made charges against him and threatened him with
criminal prosecution and demanded, to avoid his prosecution, that he turn over
to them all his shares in the capital stock of the company. The crucial part of
his evidence as to the interview in the office that morning is this:

Hadrath and Kemper both said, You had
better come clean, come clean. And we have got the goods on you. * * * After
that was gone over, it got to such an extent that I hardly knew what to say.
And then it was Hadrath said, You had better throw yourself into the hands of
Mr. Stoltze. * * * Another question came up that seemed to break the ice, was
this: Why did you give Gerald—which is my son—all of this business? I said, Mr.
Stoltze knows that Gerald got this business. Mr. Stoltze rather flew off in a
huff, and he said, I didn’t know that he got all of the business, or so much of
the business. * * * He (Stoltze) says, You have had no sympathy with others, and
I haven’t sympathy with you; you ought to be in gaol, and that is where we are
going to send you; and your friend Arthur Moxon agrees.

Mr. Moxon was the company’s solicitor in
Saskatoon and a man of very high standing in his profession. The significance of
the words “and your friend Arthur Moxon agrees” would be very apparent to a
local jury.

[Page 241]

I was simply crushed; my mind was nearly a
blank. They asked me a few more questions; and I was mentally—I hardly knew
what they did ask; asked a few more questions. And I says, What do you want me
to do? What do you want me to do? Or what can I do? What do you want me to say?
I didn’t know where I was at. I hadn’t been told. And finally Mr. Stoltze came
on to the scene again—* * * he spoke up. And he says, We want your shares in
the Reliance Lumber Company; we want your resignation; we want you to agree not
to compete with the Reliance Lumber Company anywhere, and to get out of the
country.

The respondent said that he was crushed by all
this; that Hadrath then went out into another room and came back with a paper
which he respondent signed, containing his resignation and authority to the
Dominion Bank to turn over his shares in the company. The respondent said that
when Hadrath presented the document to him he said he thought he had better get
a lawyer but was told by Stoltze, “This has got to be done before you get out
of this room.” Stoltze, on his cross-examination, when asked “Who didn’t you go to him (the respondent)
quietly, it seems the obvious
thing to do, and say, Let us get together and talk about this quietly’?”
answered, “That doesn’t happen to be my way of doing things.”

The respondent was obviously a man who was well
and favourably known in his community, active in the work of the Y.M.C.A. and
of the Rotary Club and was President of the Saskatoon Exhibition Board. He was
a married man and his home was in Saskatoon. He said that he signed the
document, not that he had done anything wrong, but he thought of “all those
different things, different friends, and people, and associations, and I
couldn’t do it—the disgrace of it.” He very positively swore that during his
administration of the company’s affairs he never knowingly did anything or
omitted to do anything to the prejudice of the company; that there was in his
mind no just ground for the complaints and charges that were made; and that he
was not attempting to stifle the prosecution of any just changes against him.
Overcome by the threats of these three men and the situation that confronted
him, he sought escape by acquiescing in their demands that he turn over his
shares.

Now those were the two stories that went to the
jury. There was a mass of evidence directed to show that here and there the
respondent had given advantage to his son in the buying of lumber for the
company and suggestions

[Page 242]

that the company had as a result been getting a
poorer grade of lumber than it otherwise would have obtained. The charges were
of the most general character and the respondent gave his explanation of the
several impeached transactions. There was no suggestion that the respondent was
offered any release by the company of any claims the company might have against
him for any loss that may have occurred as a result of the alleged breaches of
duty. What was said by the appellants was that these losses were in excess of
$30,000 and that it was a fair transaction to take the respondent’s shares in
the company in reparation for the losses.

It is perfectly plain that the jury accepted the
respondent’s story of what took place and, it being entirely contradictory of
the appellants’ story of what occurred, the jury obviously disbelieved the
appellants. The jury’s verdict was that the appellants should pay the
respondent $26,840 (being the value of the stock, $30,000, less the amount of
the loans paid to the Bank, $3,160) together with interest on that sum at the
legal rate from March 16, 1936.

Without for the moment giving consideration to
the form of the action or to certain objections taken by the appellants as to the
rejection of evidence, no one could fairly disagree with the jury, upon the
contradictory evidence, having arrived at the conclusion they did. If it had
not been for the exhaustive review of the evidence and the very able argument
presented to us by Mr. Bastedo, counsel for the appellants, I should not have
thought that there was the slightest hope for any interference with the jury’s
verdict.

Mr. Bastedo, however, contended with great force
that, the action being laid in conspiracy and there being no express plea of
malice and nothing in the charge to the jury on malice, malice cannot
reasonably be read into the questions to and the answers by the jury. If the
action was properly framed in conspiracy, I should not find any difficulty in
implying not only a charge but proof of malice. I have very considerable doubt
myself that a case of this kind properly lies in conspiracy. Where, for
instance, the charge is a charge of defrauding a man of his money, the
allegation of conspiracy may add nothing to the charge and be mere surplusage.
Conspiracy may be

[Page 243]

important where the act complained of is prima
facie not a violation of a right, but may become so by reason of malice or
spite. I am inclined to think that civil conspiracy is not properly applicable
to cases where physical property is sought to be recovered on the ground of
duress, and is really only relevant in cases of general or undefined rights,
such as the right to trade, as distinguished from defined rights, such as the
right to property. But however that may be, the effect of the jury’s findings
in this case is that there was an intentional design on the part of the three
appellants to obtain from the respondent, without any valuable consideration, a
transfer of the respondent’s shares in the company that were worth $30,000 and
that the same was demanded and obtained from the respondent by menaces and
illegal extortion. That is quite sufficient to answer the argument that a mere
threat in itself is not unlawful. As Lord Justice Cotton said in Flower v.
Sadler[4], a
threat to prosecute is not of itself illegal where a just and bona fide debt
actually exists and where the transaction between the parties involves a civil
liability as well as, possibly, a criminal act. But here the jury’s findings plainly
negative the appellants’ story that the transaction was merely the legitimate
compromise of a claim for damages for breach of duty. Moreover, the appellants
set up a civil liability on the part of the respondent to the company for
alleged loss by reason of the alleged breaches of duty but no such question was
asked of the jury and the appellants have no finding that there was any such
liability. Whether or not the remedy of the respondent was properly laid as an
action in conspiracy, the substance of the claim was that the respondent had
been maliciously and unlawfully deprived of his property by duress and
coercion, on the part of the appellants. That was the issue that was contested
at the trial and that was the issue that really went to the jury.

Objection was taken by Mr. Bastedo to the
refusal of the learned trial judge to admit evidence that was tendered on
behalf of the appellants at the trial as to the details of the report made to
Stoltze by one Davies with charges of the respondent’s misconduct as general
manager of the company, and as to information given by Davies to

[Page 244]

Stoltze as a result of which Stoltze caused the
investigation to be made by Hadrath and Kemper, and of conversations between
these persons, and of information obtained by Hadrath and Kemper on their trip
of investigation through western Canada; also general evidence of the yard
agents of the Reliance Lumber Company as to purchases of lumber being of a poor
and inferior quality and below invoice grade, and evidence of prices paid by
the Reliance Lumber Company to other companies in respect of which the
respondent’s son was alleged to be getting a commission. On the question of the
exclusion of this evidence, the jury had before them the report of Davies upon
which Stoltze acted, and the learned trial judge was quite right in declining
to permit the trial to be dragged out interminably. The report of Davies was
quite sufficient in itself for the purposes of the appellants. In any event the
exclusion of the evidence did not occasion any substantial wrong.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

Kerwin, J.—Notwithstanding Mr. Bastedo’s able argument, I think this
appeal should be dismissed. I cannot usefully add anything to the judgment of
Mr. Justice MacKenzie[5].

Hudson, J.—I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs for reasons
mentioned by Mr. Justice MacKenzie in the court below[6].

dismissed with costs.

KERWIN, J.—The accused was charged under section 229  of the Criminal
Code  with keeping a disorderly house, that is to say, a common bawdy house.
This latter expression is defined by section 225 of the Code as follows:

A common bawdy-house is a house, room, set of rooms or place
of any kind kept for purposes of prostitution or for the practice of acts of
indecency, or occupied or resorted to by one or more persons for such purposes.

There is no dispute about the facts, as the accused gave evidence
from which it appears that she had rented a room and there had intercourse with
men who paid her. Some called at the room and others were accosted by her on
the street. Another girl lived with her but nothing turns upon this as this
girl was not a prostitute. No woman had intercourse with men in the room except
the accused.

[Page 213]

The magistrate dismissed the charge, following the judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v. Sorvari[1].
That Court, with Middleton J.A. dissenting, affirmed the acquittal and from its
order the Crown now appeals.

Prior to 1907, a common bawdy house was defined by section 225 of
the Code as “a house, room, set of rooms or place of any kind kept for
purposes of prostitution,” but in that year, by 6-7 Edward VII, chapter 8,
section 2, the section was repealed and a new one enacted in the same terms but
with the addition at the end, of the words “or occupied or resorted to by one
or more persons for such purposes.” These added words clearly cover the
circumstances in the present case where there was not an isolated act of
fornication but a habitual occupation of the room for purposes of prostitution.

This same view had been expressed by the Ontario Court of Appeal
in Rex v. Margaret Smith[2], but
this decision was not cited to the court that decided the Sorvari case1
or to the court below in the present appeal. To the same effect is the decision
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Rex v. Miket[3].

The appeal should be allowed. All the facts are before the Court
but we merely direct a new trial, which we were informed by counsel for the
appellant it is not the Crown’s intention to prosecute.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL OF BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Evidence—Charge
of conspiracy to distribute drug—Evidence of accomplice—Corroboration.

The appeal was from the
affirmance by the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia of appellant's conviction for
conspiracy to distribute morphine contrary to the Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act, 1929, (Dom.). There was a dissent in the Court of Appeal on the ground
of lack of corroborative evidence and misdirection with regard thereto.

The evidence against appellant
was almost wholly that of one F., named as a co-conspirator of appellant but
who had previously been tried and convicted. F.'s story set out conversations
and dealings with appellant as to the sale of morphine and in particular an
occasion when he had met him at a certain house and went with him out of a room
there where others were gathered, and had a private conversation with him as to
delivery of morphine. A police agent gave evidence that he was present on said
occasion, that the place was one where dealings in morphine were being carried
on by some of those

[Page 422]

involved in the conspiracy,
and that he had seen F. and appellant leave the room together. Appellant in
evidence admitted being present at the place at the time, but denied that he
had any private conversation with F.

In the course of charging the
jury the trial judge stated that, while it is open to a jury to convict upon
the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, it is dangerous to do so; that
""corroboration is such evidence as confirms not only the circumstances of
the crime as related by the accomplice, but also the identity of the prisoner;
by that I do not mean that it will not be corroboration unless every
circumstance is confirmed; it will be corroboration if there is confirmation as
to a material circumstance of the crime and of the identity of the prisoner;
evidence to amount to corroboration need not be direct evidence that the
accused committed the crime, it may amount to corroboration if it is
confirmation of a material circumstance and it connects the accused with the
crime."" Referring to the police agent's evidence, he said it ""amounts
to only this: it is a confirmation, if you accept it, of F.'s evidence as to
the conspiracy on the part of the others outside of [accused]; he does appear to
corroborate him on substantial points""; and that ""all that amounts to
is this: it is proof of a fact, if you accept what F. tells you, that it did
occur; if you accept that, then you have [the police agent's] corroboration of
nothing more or less than that the conference which F. says occurred, did
occur; that is all it corroborates, and the inference there is for you,
***."" He further stated: ""If you think that corroboration is
necessary then it is for you to say whether you have corroboration which falls
within the definition I have given you.""

Held (Kerwin J. dissenting): On consideration of the
summing up as a whole and in view of all the circumstances, there was no
material misdirection or non-direction on the point of corroboration. The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin J. (dissenting): As the police agent's
testimony indicated merely an opportunity on accused's part to discuss with F.
the delivery of morphine, the trial judge was wrong in telling the jury that
the police agent's evidence, if believed, was corroboration. There were no
circumstances surrounding the particular episode that would tend to implicate
accused in the commission of the crime charged (the house in question being a
boot-legging establishment where those desiring beer, etc., might be served).
Opportunity by itself is not sufficient (Burbury v. Jackson,
[1917] 1 K.B. 16).

Kerwin J. criticized as
improper the fact that, while F. had pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy
under the same Act, he had not been sentenced at the time he gave evidence at
appellant's trial.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal of British Columbia affirming (Martin J.A. dissenting) the conviction of
the appellant (on trial before Manson J. with a jury) for conspiracy with
others to commit the indictable offence of distributing a drug (morphine)
contrary to s. 4 (f) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929
(Dom.) and amendments thereto. By the judgment now reported the appeal to this
Court was dismissed, Kerwin J. dissenting.

[Page 423]

L. Clare Moyer K.C. for
the appellant.

Gordon S. Wismer K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of the majority of
the Court (Duff C.J. and Rinfret, Davis and Hudson JJ.) was delivered by

HUDSON J.—The appellant Canning
was convicted at the trial before Mr. Justice Manson of the Court of King's
Bench of British Columbia and a jury, of unlawfully conspiring to distribute
morphine contrary to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929. From this
decision he appealed to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and in that court
the appeal was dismissed by a majority of 2 to 1. In the formal judgment the
reasons for dissent by Mr. Justice Martin are stated to be that

there is no evidence to
corroborate the witnesses for the prosecution; and that there was misdirection
and non-direction amounting to misdirection respecting said corroboration and
also respecting the consequences of the erroneous direction that there was such
evidence.

No written reasons for dissent
appear to have been delivered.

Under section 1023 of the Criminal
Code  our jurisdiction in this case is confined to any question of law in
which there has been dissent in the court of appeal. Neither in the language of
the formal judgment nor in the notice of appeal is there a clear statement of
the point or points of law upon which dissent rests, and it is questionable
whether or not there is sufficient to give jurisdiction. However, we have not
thought it necessary in the present instance to decide this question.

The evidence against Canning was
almost wholly that of a man named Furumoto who was named in the indictment as a
co-conspirator of Canning but who had previously been tried separately and
convicted. Furumoto gave a detailed story setting out various conversations and
dealings with Canning in regard to the sale of morphine and, in particular,
that on one occasion in the course of the negotiations he had met him at the
house of one Ferraro and while there went out of the room where others were
gathered and had a private conversation with Canning in regard to the delivery
of a quantity of morphine. A man named Morley Fisher, an agent of the Mounted
Police, was called as a witness on behalf of the Crown and stated that he was
present on the occasion above mentioned, that the place

[Page 424]

was one where dealings in
morphine were being carried on by some of the parties involved in the
conspiracy and that he had seen Furumoto there in conversation with Canning and
that they had gone out together. Canning was called as a witness on his own
behalf and admitted being present at this place on the evening in question but
denied that he had any private conversation with Furumoto.

The learned trial judge in his
charge to the jury correctly stated the law in regard to the danger of
accepting the evidence of an accomplice without corroboration and expressly
gave to the jury the necessary warning as stated in the judgment of this Court
in the case of Vigeant v. The King[1]
. It was contended before us that in this instance the trial judge should not
only have stated the law and given the warning as to the danger of accepting
the evidence of an accomplice, but also should specifically have charged that
the evidence of Fisher put forward on behalf of the Crown did not amount to
corroboration.

The learned trial judge in his
charge stated :

Corroboration is such
evidence as confirms not only the circumstances of the crime as related by the
accomplice, but also the identity of the prisoner. By that, I do not mean that
it will not be corroboration unless every circumstance is confirmed. It will be
corroboration if there is confirmation as to a material circumstance of the
crime and of the identity of the prisoner. Evidence to amount to corroboration
need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime—it is
important to bear that in mind here. Let me repeat it. Evidence to amount to
corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime,
it may amount to corroboration if it is confirmation of a material circumstance
and it connects the accused with the crime. I repeat: while it is open to a
jury to convict upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice, it is
dangerous to do so.

He further stated:

Now you will remember what I
said about corroboration. Corroboration is always important, whether the question
of an accomplice arises or not, particularly when you have a flat
contradiction, as you have here. Fisher says he was there on the famous
Saturday night. It is urged upon you, and it is something for you to consider,
that as Fisher said he did want to get Canning—there is no denying that he said
he was the very man he wanted to get—it is suggested to you in the defence that
Fisher is not telling the truth. Now how far does Fisher go, taking his own
statement: ""I knew about this man Canning and wanted to get him.""
What evidence have you that he wanted to get him? The only evidence he gives is
the evidence that on this Saturday night he saw the accused call Furumoto away
from the kitchen for a conference. He says they went to the foot of the stairs in
the front room, and he said at one point that they went upstairs, but obviously
he did not actually see them go

[Page 425]

upstairs. He perhaps, giving
him credit for truthfulness, if you so desire, he probably was giving a
conclusion there from what he saw them do, rather than an actual statement of
fact, because he says in cross-examination he did not see them go upstairs,
although he said so before, and he then said ""the living room and the foot
of the stairs were out of my range of vision."" Furumoto says definitely
they did leave the kitchen at the accused's request and did go upstairs.
Fisher's evidence amounts to only this: it is a confirmation, if you accept it,
of Furumoto's evidence as to the conspiracy on the part of the others outside
of Canning. He does appear to corroborate him on substantial points.

At the conclusion of the charge,
counsel for the prisoner asked this question : 

Did I understand your
lordship's instructions to be the jury might consider Morley Fisher's statement
that he heard Canning ask Furumoto to go upstairs, to be corroborative evidence—that
they might consider it as such?

The Court:

Yes, I think so. The charge
is that this conspiracy was between certain dates, and it is not confined to
the sale of these two particular half pounds, if sale there was, by Furumoto to
Canning. The charge is not confined to these two particular incidents. It says
he did conspire between the 15th day of August, 1934, and the 1st day of March,
1936. Now then if it be that Furumoto and the accused conferred at a time and
place within these dates—Fisher does not say, of course, and you know this
perfectly well, members of the jury, Fisher does not say he overheard the
conversation. He does not know what the conversation was. It might have been as
to the weather. All that amounts to is this: it is proof of a fact, if you
accept what Furumoto tells you, that it did occur. If you accept that, then you
have Fisher's corroboration of nothing more or less than that the conference
which Furumoto says occurred, did occur. That is all it corroborates, and the
inference there is for you, as I pointed out.

Then, after some further
discussion, the learned trial judge said :

I think the best thing I can
do for you is to read again what constitutes corroboration. It may be just as
well that I should read that to you now so that you will have it fresh.
Corroboration is such evidence as confirms not only the circumstances of the
crime as related by the accomplice, but also the identity of the prisoner. By
that I do not mean that it will not be corroboration unless every circumstance
is confirmed. It will be corroboration if there is confirmation as to a
material circumstance of the crime and of the identity of the prisoner.
Evidence to amount to corroboration need not be direct evidence that the
accused committed the crime, it may amount to corroboration if it is
confirmation of a material circumstance and it connects the accused with the
crime. Then you will remember with what I concluded. I told you it is open to a
jury to convict upon the evidence of an accomplice alone if they are so advised—if
that is their opinion—but it is dangerous to do so without corroboration. If
you think that corroboration is necessary then it is for you to say whether you
have corroboration which falls within the definition I have given you.

On consideration of the summing
up as a whole and in view of all the circumstances, we do not think that there

[Page 426]

was material misdirection or non-direction
on the point of corroboration. The appeal should be dismissed.

KERWIN J. (dissenting)—The
appellant was convicted of unlawfully conspiring to distribute morphine
contrary to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929. The only direct
evidence against him was given by one Furumoto, who testified that on a certain
occasion a conversation took place between him and the accused, and that at a
subsequent date, in the house of one Ferraro, another conversation occurred
between them. It is of this latter date that the witness Fisher, a Mounted
Police agent, spoke, and he testified that he saw the two leave Ferraro's
kitchen together. Furumoto's evidence was that they went upstairs and that it
was there a conversation occurred in regard to the delivery of a quantity of
morphine. Fisher, of course, could not, and did not, attempt to speak of what
transpired between Furumoto and the accused.

The learned trial judge told the
jury that Fisher's evidence, if believed, was corroboration within the meaning
of the rule. With this I cannot agree, as Fisher's testimony indicated merely
an opportunity on the part of the accused to discuss with Furumoto the delivery
of morphine. There were no circumstances surrounding the particular episode
that would tend to implicate the accused in the commission of the crime
charged, as Ferraro conducted a boot-legging establishment, according to all
the evidence, where those who desired to obtain beer and other refreshments
might be served.

Opportunity by itself is not sufficient. Burbury v. Jackson[2] . The main judgment in that case was delivered by
Lord Reading, who had delivered the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in
The King v. Baskerville[3]
. At page 18 of the Burbury case[4] , the
Lord Chief Justice states:

The evidence here shows
nothing more than that it was possible to have committed the misconduct at the
material date. That is not enough. The evidence must show that the misconduct
was probable. If the parties were seen in the neighbourhood of a wood or other
dark place where they had no occasion to be, that might possibly be corroborative
evidence. So in the case cited of Harvey v. Anning[5]
the fact of persons of different social positions being seen together in lanes
was held enough.

[Page 427]

Whether there was other evidence
in which the jury could, if properly directed, find corroboration, is
immaterial as the trial judge did not refer to it in his charge but on the
contrary directed the jury that Fisher's evidence, if believed, was
corroboration. Hubin v. The King (1).

While not open on this appeal,
there is a matter that should, I think, be referred to. That is, that while
Furumoto had pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy, under the same Act, he
had not been sentenced at the time he gave evidence at the trial of the present
applicant. This is a practice that should not be tolerated.

In my opinion, the appeal should
be allowed and a new trial directed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA IN BANCO

Criminal law—Constitutional law—Application
of fines—Whether payable to the Province or to the Dominion—Cr. Code, s.
1036—Proceeding instituted at the instance of a Department of the Government of
Canada in which that Government “bears the cost of prosecution” (exception (b)
in s. 1036(1), Cr. Code).

The question was whether certain fines in
question should be paid to the Treasurer of the Province of Nova Scotia or to
the Minister of Finance for Canada.

An information was laid at Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the instance of
the Department of National Revenue of the Government of Canada, against certain
persons as having conspired to commit specified indictable offences against the
Excise Act  and the Customs Act , and contrary to s. 573  of the Criminal
Code .

The accused were, on a preliminary inquiry at
Halifax, committed for trial, were subsequently admitted to bail, later they
surrendered to the gaol keeper, they were granted writs of habeas corpus and
recipias corpus to bring them before the stipendiary magistrate in and
for the City of Halifax, before whom they were brought and charged, they
consented to be tried by him under Part XVI of the Criminal Code , pleaded
guilty, were convicted and adjudged to be imprisoned and to pay the fines now
in question, aggregating $16,000, which were paid to the treasurer of the City
of Halifax.

Counsel for the informant, on instructions of
the Department of National Revenue, appeared at the preliminary inquiry, on the
applications for bail and for writs of habeas corpus, etc., and at the
trial. The prosecuting officer for the County of Halifax, or his assistant,
appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia on the same
proceedings except the preliminary inquiry.

The Province or the Municipality of the
County of Halifax made no disbursements. The Department of National Revenue
paid direct to the parties concerned the fees of informant’s counsel, costs of
stenographer’s

[Page 404]

notes, and other costs, and fees of witnesses
for the prosecution and fees and allowances of the justice of the peace on the
preliminary inquiry. Witnesses’ fees or the justice’s fees and allowances were
never certified to be correct nor produced or presented to the treasurer of the
municipality in manner prescribed under The Costs and Fees Act, R.S.N.S.
1923, c. 252 (which provides for payment thereof) and no claim for fees by
witnesses or the justice was made to the treasurer of the municipality. The
Dominion Government did not pay for the services of the said prosecuting
officer (or his assistant) or of the stipendiary magistrate (who each receive
remuneration annually from the Government of Nova Scotia or the municipality).

Held: The
fines in question were imposed in a proceeding instituted at the instance of
the Government of Canada or of a department thereof, in which that Government
bore the cost of prosecution, within the meaning of exception (b) in s.
1036 (1)  of the Criminal Code , and were payable to the Minister of
Finance for Canada.

Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in
banco, 11 M.P.R. 335, affirmed on above ground.

Per Duff C.J.,
Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.: The words “in which that Government bears the
cost of prosecution” in said exception (b) in s. 1036 (1)  do not relate
to what may take place in a particular prosecution; they connote something
broader than the mere casual occurrence of the payment of the costs in an
individual case; they imply a consistent course of action sanctioned by law or
by custom. The existence of The Costs and Fees Act of Nova Scotia cannot
affect the construction nor preclude the true effect of s. 1036  of the Criminal
Code , which is essentially federal legislation. As to custom or practice,
the Government of Canada had full right to institute the proceedings and to
conduct the prosecution in question; and the costs thereof were such as would
usually and properly be borne by the Dominion of Canada; and, moreover, they in
fact were so borne.

The provinces establish and maintain the
ordinary criminal courts and, for this reason in itself, the “cost of prosecution”
referred to in said exception (b) must be of a character apart from the
ordinary costs of maintenance of those courts.

The said words “cost of prosecution” which
the “Government bears” are necessarily referable to cost specially incurred in
connection with the proceeding it has instituted. The fact that the trial was
presided over by a stipendiary magistrate who is not paid by the Government of
Canada, or the participation by the prosecuting officer, or his assistant, who
are not paid by that Government, does not affect the situation. When acting in
the premises, said magistrate and prosecuting officer (who receive their
remuneration annually as aforesaid) are doing so merely as part of their
regular duties; they were not paid specifically in connection with the
prosecution in question.

Per Davis J.:
Without attempting to define the full scope and extent of the statutory
condition that the Government of Canada “bears the cost of prosecution,” it is
plain that in this case that Government did bear such cost within the meaning
of that condition; and this is sufficient for the purpose of deciding the
present question.

Quaere, as to
the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the appeal (on noting the language
of the relevant provisions—ss. 1 and 6 of c. 226, R.S.N.S. 1923, under which
the Reference was made to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and s. 43 of the Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35)

[Page 405]

APPEAL by the Attorney-General of the
Province of Nova Scotia from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in
banco[1],
holding that the amount of certain fines which the Provincial Treasurer of Nova
Scotia claimed should be paid over to him by the City of Halifax or the
Treasurer of the City of Halifax under s. 1036  of the Criminal Code , and
which claim was referred to that Court by order in council under and by virtue
of R.S.N.S. 1923, c. 226 (Of the Decision of Constitutional and Other
Provincial Questions), was not payable over to the Provincial Treasurer
under s. 1036  of the Criminal Code  in the circumstances set forth in the
statement of facts contained in the order in council, but that the same was
payable to the Minister of Finance of Canada.

The material facts are sufficiently stated in
the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal
to this Court was dismissed.

J. H. MacQuarrie K.C. for the appellant.

H. P. MacKeen K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of Duff C.J., Rinfret, Kerwin and
Hudson JJ. was delivered by

Rinfret J.—By order in council dated the 12th day of June, 1936, the
Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia, by and with the advice of the Executive
Council of Nova Scotia, and acting under chapter 226 of the Revised Statutes of
Nova Scotia 1923 (Entitled: “Of the Decision of Constitutional and other Provincial
Questions”), referred this matter to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for
hearing and consideration.

The Provincial Treasurer claims that the amount
of certain fines hereinafter mentioned should be paid over to him by the City
of Halifax, or the Treasurer of that city, under section 103G  of the Criminal
Code ; and the question to be decided in this appeal is whether the fines in
question belong to the Province, represented by the Provincial Treasurer, or to
the Dominion of Canada, represented by the Minister of Finance, under the
following circumstances set forth in the order in council:

[Page 406]

On the 10th day of June, 1935, an information
was laid in the city of Halifax, before a justice of the peace in and for the
county of Halifax, by Frank E. McGowran, a corporal of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, on the instructions of the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police at the instance of the Department of National Revenue of the
Government of Canada.

The information and complaint were to the effect
that certain persons therein named and domiciled respectively in the provinces
of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had, at Halifax and
elsewhere, between the 1st day of January, 1927, and the 8th day of June, 1935,
conspired together and with one another to commit the following offences:

1. The indictable offence of having in
their possession without lawful authority spirits unlawfully imported contrary
to section 181  of the Excise Act  1927, and section 169  of the Excise
Act , 1934, and section 573  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

2. The indictable offences of harbouring,
keeping, concealing, purchasing and selling without lawful excuse alcoholic
liquor unlawfully imported into Canada of a value for duty exceeding two
hundred dollars, to wit, of a value of upwards of one millions dollars, without
paying the duties lawfully payable thereon contrary to section 217 (3)  of the Customs
Act , 1927, and section 573  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

3. The indictable offence of smuggling and
clandestinely introducing into Canada alcoholic liquor subject to Customs Duty
of a value for duty of over two hundred dollars, to wit, of a value of upwards
of one million dollars, contrary to section 203 (3)  of the Customs Act  as
amended, and section 573  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

4. The indictable offence of by deceit or
falsehood or other fraudulent means defrauding His Majesty the King in the
Right of the Dominion of Canada of Customs and Excise duties to the extent of
upwards of one million dollars.

The several persons charged in this information
appeared before the justice of the peace in the city of Halifax to answer the
charge; and a preliminary inquiry was held, as a result of which they were
committed to the common gaol at the city of Halifax for trial on the said
charge.

At the preliminary inquiry, the prosecution was
conducted by counsel for the informant on instructions of the Department of
National Revenue.

The persons charged were subsequently admitted
to bail by a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. On the application for
bail counsel appeared on behalf of the informant, again on the instructions of
the Department of National Revenue. On that occasion, the assistant to the

[Page 407]

prosecuting officer for the county of Halifax appeared on behalf of the
Attorney-General of Nova Scotia.

Later on, on the 27th day of September, 1935,
the persons charged surrendered to the keeper of the common gaol and applied to
a judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for writs of habeas corpus and
recipias corpus to bring them before the stipendiary magistrate in and
for the city of Halifax. On the application for these writs both the
prosecuting officer for the county of Halifax appeared on behalf of the
Attorney-General of Nova Scotia and counsel appeared on behalf of the informant
on instructions of the Department of National Revenue.

The writs were granted, and by virtue thereof
the accused were brought before the stipendiary magistrate and charged with the
offence set forth in the information (then amended as will be mentioned later).
They consented to be tried before the stipendiary magistrate under Part XVI of
the Criminal Code . The amendment to the information consisted in
striking off paragraphs 2 and 3 the words: “to wit, of a value of upwards of
one million dollars”; thus leaving the “value for duty” of the alcoholic liquor
unlawfully imported, or introduced, into Canada as exceeding two hundred
dollars, without stating any definite amount. The information was further
amended by striking out paragraph 4 thereof.

The accused pleaded guilty and they were
convicted and adjudged to be imprisoned for terms varying in length, and also
to forfeit and pay certain fines to be “applied according to law,” the
aggregate of which amounted to $16,000.

At the trial, the prosecuting officer appeared
on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia, and counsel appeared on
behalf of the informant on the instructions of the Department of National
Revenue.

The fines imposed by the stipendiary magistrate
were paid to the Treasurer of the City of Halifax, who has since held the same;
and, in effect, the question submitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was:
To whom, of the Provincial Treasurer or of the Minister of Finance of Canada,
the amount of the fines should now be paid over by the Treasurer of the City of
Halifax?

The judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
were unanimous in the opinion that the amount of the fines were

[Page 408]

not payable over to the Provincial Treasurer
under section 1036  of the Criminal Code , in the circumstances set forth
in the statement of facts contained in the order in council; but that the same
were payable to the Minister of Finance. Their reasons, however, for reaching
that conclusion differed in the following respects: The Chief Justice (Mr.
Justice Carroll and Mr. Justice Doull concurring) was of opinion that the fines
should go to the Dominion Government, both because they have been “imposed in
respect of the breach of the revenue laws of Canada” and also because they were
imposed “in a proceeding instituted at the instance of the Government of
Canada, or of a department thereof, in which that Government bore the cost of
prosecution.” Mr. Justice Ross (with whom Mr. Justice Hall concurred), while
sharing the opinion on the second point and, therefore, on the result, stated
that he was “not prepared at the moment to agree that the fines were imposed in
respect of a breach of the revenue laws of Canada.”

The matter is now referred to us under section
43 of the Supreme Court Act, in view of the fact that, by section 6 of
chapter 226 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923, the opinion of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia upon the reference, although advisory only, is,
for all purposes of appeal to this Court, to “ be treated as a final judgment
of the court between parties.”

The answer to the question put by the
Lieutenant-Governor in Council of Nova Scotia must result from the
interpretation of the first paragraph of section 1036  of the Criminal Code .

That paragraph is as follows:

1036. Whenever no other provision is made
by any law of Canada for the application of any fine, penalty or forfeiture
imposed for the violation of any law or of the proceeds of an estreated
recognizance, the same shall be paid over by the magistrate or officer
receiving the same to the treasurer of the province in which the same is
imposed or recovered, except that

(a) all fines, penalties and
forfeitures imposed in respect of the breach of any of the revenue laws of
Canada, or imposed upon any officer or employee of the Government of Canada in
respect of any breach of duty or malfeasance in his office or employment, and
the proceeds of all recognizances estreated in connection with proceedings for
the prosecution of persons charged with such breaches or malfeasances; and

(b) all fines, penalties and
forfeitures imposed for whatever cause in any proceeding instituted at the
instance of the Government of

[Page 409]

Canada or of any department thereof in
which that Government beans the cost of prosecution, and the proceeds of all
recognizances estreated in connection with such proceedings, shall belong to
His Majesty for the public uses of Canada, and shall be paid by the magistrate
or officer receiving the same to the Minister of Finance and form part of the
Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada.

(N.B.—We omit the last part of the paragraph
which concerns exclusively the province of Ontario.)

By force of the enactment, as will be observed,
the general rule is that fines are payable over to the Treasurer of the
province. They belong to His Majesty for the public use of Canada, they are to be paid to the Minister
of Finance and to form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada only in
some particular cases which are exceptions to the rule.

The Dominion government claims that the fines
here in question come within either of two of the exceptions prescribed in the
enactment. It is contended by the Attorney-General of Canada that they were “
imposed in respect of the breach of any of the revenue laws of Canada,” and
that they were “imposed * * * in a proceeding instituted at the instance of the
Government of Canada or of a department thereof in which that Government bore
the cost of prosecution.” The Dominion, to succeed, must establish that the
fines came within one of the exceptions mentioned; but, on the other hand, the
Province cannot succeed unless it is able to eliminate both exceptions.

For that reason, we find it sufficient to
examine the question submitted in its relation to the second exception relied
on by the Attorney-General of Canada. Our reason for doing so is obvious: it
was the ground upon which all the learned judges of the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia agreed in their answers upon the reference; and, moreover, if we should
reach the same conclusion as they have, it becomes unnecessary to deal with the
respective claims of the parties in their relation with the first exception.

It is conceded that the proceeding as a result
of which the fines were imposed was instituted at the instance of a department
of the Government of Canada. It remains only to be seen whether it was a
proceeding in which “that Government bears the cost of prosecution,” within the
meaning of subsection (b) of section 1036 .

[Page 410]

The order in council states in terms that “no
disbursements in connection with the said prosecution have been made by the
Province of Nova Scotia or by the municipality of the county of Halifax.” It is
also therein stated that the fees of counsel who appeared on behalf of the
informant on instructions of the Department of National Revenue, the amount of
the account of the stenographer for taking shorthand notes of the evidence on
the preliminary inquiry and for transcribing the same, and any other costs,
fees, charges or expenses there may have been in connection with the said
prosecution, were paid direct to the parties concerned also by the same
Department of National Revenue. This Department likewise paid direct to them
the sums of money required to the witnesses for the prosecution on the preliminary
inquiry, or to the justice of the peace for fees and allowances claimed by him
for his services in respect of the preliminary inquiry. No claim or demand by
or on behalf of the witnesses or of the justice of the peace was ever made to
the Treasurer of the municipality of the County of Halifax.

But, on behalf of the Province, the
Attorney-General of Nova Scotia points out that, of course, the services of the
prosecuting officer and those of the stipendiary magistrate were not paid by
the Dominion Government. It is further asserted that, although the fees and
allowances claimed by the justice of the peace and the witnesses’ fees were
paid by the Dominion, that was on the latter’s part a purely voluntary and
gratuitous payment, because these fees, charges and expenses are already
provided for in a provincial statute, The Costs and Fees Act (ch. 252 of
the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923); and that such fees and charges were
never certified to be correct, nor produced and presented to the Treasurer of
the municipality of the county of Halifax in the manner prescribed in the
schedule to Part II of that provincial statute; whereas, if the prescriptions
of that statute had been followed by the justice of the peace and the
witnesses, their fees and charges would have been met and paid as provided for
therein.

The respective rights of the parties, however,
must be determined in accordance with the true construction of the section of
the Criminal Code  which applies; they cannot be made to depend upon what
may have happened in this

[Page 411]

particular instance. It may not be left to the
option of one party to act in a certain way and later to claim the fines on the
strength of the procedure it has elected to follow. The answer which the court
must give must flow essentially from the language of the statute. And when the
statute enacts that the fines are to belong to the Government of Canada in a
proceeding “in which that Government bears the cost of prosecution,” that
language does not relate to what may take place in a particular prosecution.

The phrase in the enactment: “in which that
Government bears the cost of prosecution” connotes something broader than the
mere casual occurrence of the payment of the costs in an individual case; it
implies a consistent course of action sanctioned by law or by custom.

Moreover, the words “cost of prosecution” which,
so it is enacted, the “Government bears” are necessarily referable to cost
specially incurred in connection with the proceeding it has instituted and
resulting in the imposition of the fines which, under the exception, become
payable to the Minister of Finance.

For that reason, the fact that the trial was
presided over by a stipendiary magistrate, who is not paid by the Government of
Canada; or the participation of the prosecuting officer and his assistant, who
are not paid by that Government, does not affect the situation. The magistrate
and the prosecuting officer are receiving their remuneration annually either
from the municipality or from the Government of Nova Scotia; and, when acting
in the premises, they are doing so merely as part of their regular duties; they
were not paid specifically in connection with the prosecution with which we are
concerned, or with the proceeding herein instituted at the instance of the
Government of Canada.

It cannot be questioned, as stated moreover in
the order in council, that all the “costs, fees, charges or expenses there may
have been in connection with the said prosecution” have been incurred and paid
by the Government of Canada, and the question is whether they were costs which
the Government of Canada bore within the meaning of section 1036 .

[Page 412]

Whether the stipendiary magistrate could or
could not have ordered the costs to be paid otherwise, it is sufficient to note
that, in the convictions adjudging the payment of the fines, no order was made
as to costs.

We have said that subs. (b) implied a
consistent course of action sanctioned by law or custom. As to the law, there
are no provisions in the Criminal Code  expressly dealing with the matter
in issue. Of The Costs and Fees Act of Nova Scotia, it is sufficient to
say that, in our view, its existence cannot affect the construction, nor
preclude the true effect, of section 1036  of the Criminal Code , which is
essentially federal legislation. As to custom or practice, it cannot be doubted
that the Government of Canada had full right to institute the proceedings and
to conduct the prosecution before the court.

The provinces establish and maintain the
ordinary criminal courts and, for this reason alone, we think that the costs of
prosecution referred to in section 1036  of the Criminal Code  must be of
a character apart from the ordinary costs of maintenance of these courts.

As stated by Chief Justice Chisholm in his reasons
for judgment in the present case:

It has always been the practice to permit
counsel for the Government of Canada to act in revenue eases, nominally under
the Attorney-General of the Province. The Attorney-General has the nominal, the
counsel for the Government of Canada has the virtual conduct of such
prosecutions. In no other way can the revenues of Canada be adequately or at
all protected unless the Dominion is represented and given the conduet of the
case.

We have no doubt that this statement of the learned
Chief Justice, concurred in by the other judges of the court, rightly
represents the situation.

In our view, the costs of prosecution in this
case are such as would usually and properly be borne by the Dominion of Canada
and, moreover, they here in fact were borne by the Dominion of Canada. For
these reasons, we think that the amount of the fines in question is not payable
to the Provincial Treasurer but is payable to the Minister of Finance of
Canada.

The appeal should, therefore, be dismissed. There
will be no order as to costs.

[Page 413]

Davis J.—I agree that this appeal should be dismissed, but it is
sufficient, in my opinion, to rest that conclusion upon the sole ground that
the particular facts stated in the Reference satisfy the condition of section
1036  (b) of the Criminal Code  that the Government of Canada “bears
the cost of prosecution,” it being admitted that the proceedings were
instituted at the instance of a department of that Government.

The facts are not in dispute. It is stated in
the Reference that the information was laid by a member of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police on the instructions of the Commissioner at the instance of the
Department of National Revenue of the Government of Canada; that the
preliminary inquiry before a Justice of the Peace in the City of Halifax
extended to eleven days during the months of July and August, 1935; that at the
said preliminary inquiry the prosecution was conducted by two counsel for the
informant, on instructions of the said Department of National Revenue; that on
the application before a Judge of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia of the
several accused for bail, counsel appeared on behalf of the informant, on the
instructions of the said department, and that an assistant to the prosecuting
officer for the County of Halifax (receiving an annual salary from the
Government of Nova Scotia) appeared on behalf of the Attorney-General of Nova
Scotia; that subsequently on the return of writs of habeas corpus, counsel
appeared on behalf of the informant, on instructions of the said department,
and the prosecuting officer for the County of Halifax appeared on behalf of the
Attorney-General of Nova Scotia; that at the trial counsel appeared on behalf
of the informant, on instructions of the said department, and the said
prosecuting officer for the County of Halifax appeared on behalf of the
Attorney-General of Nova Scotia; that no disbursements in connection with the
said prosecution have been made by the Province of Nova Scotia or by the
Municipality of the County of Halifax, but the said prosecuting officer was
receiving an annual salary from the Provincial Government; that the fees of
counsel for the informant in connection with the said prosecution and the
amounts of the account of a stenographer for taking shorthand notes of the
evidence on the said preliminary inquiry and 

[Page 414]

transcribing the same, and any other costs,
fees, charges or expenses there may have been in connection with the said
prosecution (other than those prescribed in the Schedule to Part II of The
Costs and Fees Act, ch. 252 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923)
were paid direct to the parties concerned by the said Department of National
Revenue; that the said department paid sums of money direct to the witnesses
for the prosecution on the said preliminary inquiry, as fees claimed by them
and prescribed in the said Schedule to said Part II of The Costs and Fees
Act for their travel and actual attendance; that the said Department of
National Revenue paid sums of money direct to the said Justice of the Peace as
the fees and allowances claimed by him and prescribed in the said Schedule to
said Part II of The Costs and Fees Act, for his services in respect of
the said preliminary inquiry.

Without attempting to define the full scope and
extent of the statutory condition that the Government of Canada “bears the cost
of prosecution,” it is plain, I think, in this case that the Government of
Canada bore the cost of the prosecution within the contemplation of the
statutory condition. It would, in my opinion, entirely defeat the object of the
provision of sec. 1036  (b) if the facts of this case were held not to
come within the language of the provision. That being so, there is no necessity
to consider whether or not the Dominion could recover by virtue of the
provision of sec. 1036  (a).

As the appeal is to be dismissed, it is not
necessary to discuss the question of the jurisdiction of this Court to
entertain the appeal, but it may be observed that sec. 43 of the Supreme
Court Act gives a right of appeal to this Court

from an opinion pronounced by the highest
court of final resort in any province on any matter referred to it for hearing
and consideration by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of such province
whenever it has been by the statutes of the said province declared that such
opinion is to be deemed a judgment of the said highest court of final resort
and that an appeal shall lie therefrom as from a judgment in an action.

The provincial statute under which this
Reference was made by the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia in Council to the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia is chapter 226 of the Revised Statutes of Nova
Scotia, 1923. The relevant sections, 1 and 6, are as follows:

[Page 415]

1. The Governor in Council may refer to the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, for hearing or consideration, any matter which he
thinks fit to refer, and the court shall thereupon hear and consider the same.

6. The opinion of the court upon any such
reference, although advisory only, shall, for all purposes of appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada, or to His Majesty in Council, be treated as a final
judgment of the court between parties.

Had we reached a different conclusion on the
merits of this appeal, the question of the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain
the appeal would have presented some difficulty.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Offence of stealing a “post
letter” from a “post office”— Meaning—Construction—Provincial “parliamentary
post office”— Criminal Code , sections 6  and 324 —Post Office Act, R.S.C., 1927,
c. 161, ss. 2 (h, j, l), 4, 7, 35, 39, 101—Criminal Code , section 364 .

The appellant was charged, under section 364 
of the Criminal Code , with having stolen “une lettre dans le bureau de poste du
Parlement” in the city of Quebec. He was found guilty and the conviction was
affirmed by a majority of the appellate court. The appeal in this Court was as
to the proper construction of section 364  of the Criminal Code .

Held, Duff C
J. and Davis J. dissenting, that the appeal should be allowed and the
conviction quashed.

Per Cannon J.—The control and responsibility
of the Dominion post office authorities over the stolen letter ceased from the
moment that it was delivered in the main post office to the representative of
the provincial authorities.—In law, the letter was abstracted after it
had been delivered to the duly constituted agents of the provincial authorities
and it had passed out of the control of the Dominion post office: the
abstraction took place when it was no more a “post letter” or “lettre confiée à la poste.”

Per Crocket
J.—The parliamentary post office (bureau de poste du Parlement) was not a
“bureau de poste” within the meaning of section 364  of the Criminal Code ; and,
also, the stolen letter was not a “lettre confiée à la poste” at the
time of the theft in the sense of that expression as given in section 2 of the Post
Office Act. The letter at that time was neither in a “post office” nor
“being carried through the post,” the Post Office Department’s control and
responsibility of and for it having ceased upon its delivery at the so-called
“bureau de poste” which was officered and operated by appointees of the
Provincial Government entirely at the latter’s expense and over which neither
the Quebec city post office nor the Post Office Department of Canada had any
control.

Per Kerwin
J.—The parliamentary post office was not a “post office” within the meaning of
section 2 (l) of the Post Office Act. A “post office” means any
building * * * where any letter which may be sent by post is received * * *;
and it cannot have been intended that any letter which may be sent by post is in
a post office unless it is in a building * * * which is under the
control of the Postmaster-General as part of the postal service of Canada. Upon
the evidence, the quarters in the Legislative Assembly building in Quebec, set
aside by the provincial authorities cannot be said to be part of the postal
service of Canada, even though what was done was by the consent or authority of
the Postmaster-General.

[Page 33]

Per Duff C.J.
and Davis J. (dissenting).—Upon the evidence and in view of the findings of the
trial judge, the officials of the Parliamentary Post Office, in all their
activities, in undertaking to receive, collect send or deliver letters and in
receiving, collecting sending, delivering letters and having in possession
letters for the purpose of so conveying and delivering them, were acting under
the authority of the Postmaster-General. The Parliamentary Post Office was a
post office established by the Postmaster-General in exercise of his powers
(section 7) under the Post Office Act, and, therefore, a post office
within the contemplation of section 364  of the Criminal Code . Accordingly, the
letter in question in this case had not ceased to be a “post letter” within the
meaning of that section when it was abstracted by the appellant.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Court of King’s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, dismissing his
appeal, by a majority of the Court, from his conviction by J. H. Fortier J.
after a summary trial for having stolen a “post letter” from a “post office” contrary to the provisions of section 364  of the
Criminal Code .

F. Choquette K.C. for the appellant.

A. Rivard K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis J.
(dissenting) was delivered by

Duff C.J.—This appeal raises a question as to the scope of section 364  of
the Criminal Code  under which it is an offence to steal a “post letter” from a
“post office.” The definition of “post office” in the Post Office Act is
a very broad one and comprises (inter alias) under that term all places
where “mailable matter” is “received or distributed, sorted, put up in packets
or despatched.”

The appellant was charged with having stolen a
“post letter” from the post office, which is generally referred to in the
record under the designation “the Parliamentary Post Office.” He was found
guilty. An appeal was taken to the Court of King’s Bench on various grounds.
Only two of them will require discussion; first, that, “on the evidence,” the
Legislative Post Office is not a “post office” within the meaning of section
364  of the Criminal Code ; and, second, that the letter stolen was not a “post
letter” within the meaning of that section.

These questions, in my conception of the
evidence and of the findings of the trial judge, are, I am disposed to think,

[Page 34]

questions of mixed fact and law rather than of
law; and, moreover, I am disposed
to think that in substance the grounds of dissent in the Court of King’s Bench
are matters of mixed law and fact rather than matters of law. Since, however, I am satisfied that the appeal should
be dismissed on the merits, I shall
not further discuss the point of jurisdiction.

By section 6 of the Criminal Code :

In every case in which the offence dealt
with in this Act relates to the subject treated of in any other Act the words
and expressions used herein in respect to such offence shall have the meaning
assigned to them in such other Act.

and before proceeding to the facts, it is
convenient first of all to quote the precise terms of the definition of “post
office” contained in the Post Office Act. That definition is as follows:

2(1) “post office” means any building,
room, post office, railway car, street letter box, street stamp-vending box,
receiving box or other receptacle or place where post letters or other mailable
matter are received or delivered, sorted, made up or despatched.

By section 7
of the Act, the Postmaster-General has authority to,

“(a) establish
and close post offices and post routes.”

Since there is nothing in the context which
“otherwise requires,” it follows that “post office” here has the meaning
ascribed to the phrase in section 2(1); and,
in consequence, the Postmaster-General has authority under section 7 to establish a post office for
providing any one or more of the services mentioned in this definition.

By section 35,

Subject to the provisions and regulations
aforesaid, and the exceptions hereinafter made, the Postmaster-General shall
have the sole and exclusive privilege of conveying, receiving, collecting,
sending and delivering letters within Canada.

Our attention has not been called to anything in
the “provisions and regulations aforesaid” which qualifies the application of
this section in its bearing on this appeal. There is another section which
ought not to be overlooked. Section 101 is
in these words:

Every person who without the authority of
the Postmaster-General, the proof of which authority shall rest on such person,
places or permits or causes to be placed or to remain on his house or premises,
the words Post Office, or any other words or mark which imply or give
reasonable cause to believe that such house or premises is a post office or a
place for the receipt of letters, shall, on summary conviction, incur a penalty
not exceeding ten dollars for each offence.

[Page 35]

2. Any person who, otherwise than in
conformity with this Act, collects, sends, conveys or delivers, or undertakes
to collect, send, convey or deliver any letter within Canada, or receives or
has in his possession within Canada any letter for the purpose of so conveying
or delivering it, shall, for each and every letter so unlawfully collected,
sent, conveyed or delivered, or undertaken so to be, or found in his
possession, incur a penalty not exceeding twenty dollars.

The learned trial judge had before him a letter
addressed by the Deputy Postmaster-General to the Postmaster at Quebec, who
appears to have filled the role of Post Office Inspector for the city of
Quebec, dated the 12th of March, 1919. That letter was written in response to a
request made by the Legislative Assembly of Quebec “for the installation of a
House of Assembly Post Office” and authorized the inauguration of such a post
office, which I shall refer to hereafter as the Parliamentary Post Office. There
were departmental memoranda, apparently, indicating the character of the office
to be established which are not in evidence, but the letter, coupled with the
facts found by the trial judge, determines with sufficient accuracy for our
present purposes the character of it.

As to outgoing mail, the letter states:

Letters and other matter prepaid by postage
stamps would be stamped and “primary” sorted in the Legislative Assembly Post
Office. This mail would be sent in “lock” bags to the Quebec Post Office, where
it would be carefully looked over before being distributed for despatch * * *
All mail for despatch originating with any of the Provincial Departments should
be deposited in the Legislative Assembly Post Office.

As to incoming mail,

A duly authorized messenger representing
all the Legislative Assembly Departments would call at the Quebec Post Office
and sign for all registered mail for all the Departments, which he would
deliver as instructed to the several Departments located in the Legislative Assembly
building. The lock bag containing the ordinary mail would be sent to the
Legislative Assembly Post Office, where it would be distributed and messengers
from the various branches call at that post office for the mail.

* * *

Mails would be conveyed as often as
required by a courier with horse drawn vehicle, whose services would be paid
for by the Legislative Assembly.

Again,

* * * the Legislative Assembly Post Office
would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules and
regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada,

Now, this letter makes it quite clear that this
Parliamentary Post Office was established at the request of the Legislative
Assembly for the convenience of the Legislative Assembly and the Government
departments housed

[Page 36]

in the same building and their employees; and
that the intention of the letter is to give the authority of the
Postmaster-General to the establishment of such an office, where mail would be
received from the Quebec Post Office in one of the Departmental sacks; that
such sacks would be opened at the Parliamentary Post Office and the mail
contained therein distributed in the usual way to be called for and delivered
to persons to whom the mail might be addressed or to messengers of the
Departments. It was also contemplated that mailable matter prepaid by postage
stamps would be received and stamped with an official stamp of the usual
character and provisionally sorted in the Post Office and sent forward in an
official bag to the Quebec Post Office. It was contemplated, there can be no
doubt, that this Parliamentary Post Office would be used by all the members and
employees of the Legislature; as well as by the employees of the Departments.
The effect of the letter beyond doubt is to authorize the use of legends
indicating where mail would be received as such; where letters, for example,
properly stamped, would be collected and dealt with as mail.

The learned trial judge has found as a fact that
letters are registered in this Post Office; and it appears that, for a period
which ended in 1935, Post Office orders were issued.

The Parliamentary Post Office was to be, as the
letter states, under the control of an official designated as Postmaster and
there is evidence to the effect that this official receives from the Postmaster
of Quebec, who acts as inspector of the post offices in the city of Quebec, the
circular communications addressed to postmasters generally and communications
sent to him by the inspector are addressed to him as “The Postmaster of the Parliamentary
Post Office.” The letter of the Deputy Postmaster General, as we have seen,
makes it quite plain that the office is to be governed by the rules and
regulations of the Post Office Department.

It must have been fairly clear to anybody
reading the Post Office Act that a “post office” operated in the manner
contemplated would, in the absence of authority from the Postmaster-General,
infringe the Post Office Act; and, on the evidence, the learned judge
was entitled to start from the premise that the Parliamentary Post Office

[Page 37]

was in fact established and operated under such
authority. He has, indeed, found as a fact that the Postmaster of the central
post office in Quebec gives instructions and governs and directs the
administration of the Parliamentary Post Office and that this is done
conformably to the control of this post office by the Postmaster-General and to
the circumstance that it is subject to the departmental regulations.

I concur with the following observations of Mr.
Justice St. Jacques:

L’établissement des bureaux de poste
nécessaires au service des postes relève entièrement du Ministre, et l’on sait
que les députés ministres sont particulièrement préposés à l’application des
détails de la loi.

C’est dans l’exercice des pouvoirs qui sont
confiés au ministère des Postes par les articles 35 et 39 de la loi que ce
bureau particulier a été établi dans l’édifice du Gouvernement provincial.

Il est évident que le ministre des Postes,
représenté par le sous-ministre, n’a pas voulu que ce bureau ait le caractère
complet et absolu des bureaux de poste ordinaires qui sont établis un peu
partout dans les cités, suivant les besoins du service des Postes. On a voulu
que ce bureau soit simplement un “clearing-house” oui seraient transportées par
un messager dûment autorisé par le Gouvernement provincial toutes les lettres
adressées aux divers services du Gouvernement provincial et qui sont reçues au
bureau de poste principal établi dans la cité de Québec, sur la rue Buade.

Il est prévu à ce document, émis par le
sous-ministre des Postes en 1919, que le sac fermé contenant le courrier
ordinaire serait envoyé au bureau de poste de l’Assemblée Législative où les
lettres seraient distribuées, et les messagers des différents services du
Gouvernement Provincial pourraient recevoir à ce bureau les lettres qui y
parviennent.

Il faut retenir de ce document la phrase
suivante:

“In brief, the Legislative Assembly Post
Office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules
and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada.”

Il est évident que des bureaux semblables
existent dans d’autres parties du pays, puisque le sous-ministre dit:

“The office would not be a postal station,
but a clearing house, similar to that conducted by the Federal Parliament and
applicable to the various Legislative Assemblies.”

Jusqu’à 1935, le ministère des Postes
permettait aux employés de ce bureau d’émettre des mandats et des bons
de poste, tout comme on le fait dans les bureaux de poste réguliers Ce privilège
a été supprimé par le ministère des Postes en 1935.

La recommandation des lettres peut se faire
au “bureau de poste du Parlement” qui perçoit le coût de cette recommandation.

Il importe peu, me semble-t-il, que les
employés qui travaillent dans ce bureau de poste soient engagés et payé par le
Gouvernement provincial. C’est à cette condition que le ministère des Postes a
consenti à l’établissement dans l’édifice du Gouvernement provincial d’un tel
bureau.

Ce bureau est-il régulier ou non, au sens
absolu de la loi? Ce n’en est pas moins un bureau de poste où l’on reçoit des
lettres qui ont été

[Page 38]

confiées à, la poste et où l’on reçoit
également des lettres pour être confiées a la poste.

There was evidence, I repeat, before the trial
judge from which he might not improperly conclude that the officials of the
Parliamentary Post Office, the postmaster and others, in all their activities,
in undertaking to receive, collect, send or deliver letters and in receiving,
collecting, sending, delivering letters and having in possession letters for
the purpose of so conveying and delivering them, were acting under the
authority of the Postmaster-General; and I think Mr. Justice St. Jacques is on
solid ground in holding that, in view of the evidence and of the findings of
the trial judge, the Parliamentary Post Office was a post office established by
the Postmaster-General in exercise of his powers under the Post Office Act and,
therefore, a post office within the contemplation of section 364  of the
Criminal Code . It is a post office within the scope, as I think, of section 7 
and constituted as such by the authority of the Postmaster-General. Such being
the case, it follows necessarily in my view that the letter in question had not
ceased to be a “post letter” within the meaning of section 364  when it was
abstracted by the appellant. Admittedly, it was in the Parliamentary Post
Office among a number of other letters in process of being distributed when the
abstraction occurred.

It was contended before us on behalf of the
appellant that the delivery of the post bag to the courier whose duty it was to
take the bag from the Quebec Post Office to the Parliamentary Post Office was a
delivery to the person to whom the letter was addressed. The dissenting judges
in the court below appear to have taken the view that the latter was not
delivered until it reached the Parliamentary Post Office. The trial judge was
entitled to find, however, as a fact, and in effect did so find, that the
courier was acting under the authority of the Post-master-General in carrying
an official bag from one post office to another post office and that there was
no delivery to the addressee.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Cannon J.—In his factum, the respondent states the point to be decided by
us as follows:

The Court of King’s Bench did not come to
the same understanding upon the words “post letter.” Whilst the majority
asserted that the

[Page 39]

letter, at the time of its withdrawal by
the appellant, was still “in transit,” the dissentient minority claimed that at
that time it was already in the hands of he to whom it was addressed, or at
least that it should be considered so.

Thus this is the disputable point, at the
time of the theft, which is not doubted, was the above described letter still,
yes or no, a “post letter” in the meaning of the law?

Under the provisions of the Act respecting the
postal service, R.S.C., c. 161, section 2, par. (j),

“Post letter” means any letter transmitted by the post or delivered through
the post, or deposited in any post office, or in any letter box put up anywhere
under the authority of the Postmaster-General, whether such letter is addressed
to a real or a fictitious person or not, and whether it is intended for
transmission by the post or delivery through the post or not; and a letter
shall be deemed a post letter from the time of its being so deposited to the
time of its being delivered to the person to whom it is addressed, or so
long as it remains in the post office or in any such letter box or is being
carried through the post; and a delivery to any person authorized by the
Postmaster-General to receive letters for the post shall be deemed a delivery
at the post office, and a delivery of any letter or other mailable matter at
the house or office of the person to whom the letter is addressed, or to him,
or to his servant, or agent, or other person considered to be
authorized to receive the letter or other mailable matter, according to the
usual manner of delivering that person’s letters, shall be a delivery to
the person addressed.”

Exhibit P2 concerning the organization of the
post office at the Parliament contains the following about the delivery of the
mail addressed to the Parliament Buildings:

Mails will be conveyed as often as required
by a courier with horse drawn vehicle, whose services would be paid for by the
Legislative Assembly.

* * *

The Legislative Assembly Post Office would
be conducted without any expense whatever to the Post Office Department of
Canada, and there would be no account for the purchase of stamps in view of the
fact that stamps would be purchased as hereinbefore mentioned.

In brief, the Legislative Assembly Post
Office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules
and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada. It would be operated
and officered by clerks appointed by authority of the Legislative Assembly, who
would obtain supplies of postage stamps from the City post office and postal
stations, or from stamp vendors or sub-offices of their own choosing, conveying
the mail bags both ways between the Quebec Post Office and the Legislative
Assembly, without expense to the Post Office Department of Canada in any way.

An office of this nature would not be
recognized as a regular post office, being simply a clearing house, as the
Department could not undertake to establish either a sub-office or a regular
office in a separate institution such as Provincial Government building, as all
post offices have to be for the service of the general public, and under the direct
control of the Department. Letters and other matter prepaid by postage
stamps would be stamped and “primary” sorted in the Legislative

[Page 40]

Assembly Post Office. This mail would be
sent in “lock” bags to the Quebec Post Office, where it would be carefully
looked over before being distributed for despatch.

A fully authorized messenger representing
all the Legislative Assembly Departments would call at the Quebec Post Office
and sign for all registered mail for all the Departments which he would
deliver as instructed to the several departments located in the Legislative
Assembly Building. The lock bag containing the ordinary mail would be sent
to the Legislative Assembly Post Office, where it would be distributed and
messengers from the various branches call at that post office for the mail.

Exhibit D1 contains the regulation as to the
distribution of correspondence:

Art. 246. Distribution des correspondances.

La responsabilité du ministère au sujet
d’un objet quelconque de correspondance cesse lorsquei la distribution en a été
effectuée, soit au destinaire, soit à une personne dûment autorisée à
recevoir sa correspondance, ou à une personne aux soins de qui cet
objet était adressé, et le ministère ne peut entreprendre de faire des
recherches relativement au traitement dudit objet lorsqu’il en a disposé
régulièrement.

Now, as to what happened to the letter addressed
to J. P. Bergeron, we have the evidence of the postmaster, J. B. L. Morin, who
is the Federal official in charge of the main post office and of all the
stations within the city of Quebec. Here is what he
says:

Q. Maintenant, M. Morin, voulez-vous dire
à quel endroit se fait la délivrance des lettres destinées au
Parlement de Québec?

R. Nous livronsi la malle au représentant
officiel du Parlement provincial, qui vient quatre fois par jour chercher la
malle au bureau de poste de Québec.

Q. A quel endroit?

R. A l’intérieur du bureau.

Q. De votre bureau de poste à vous?

R. Au bureau chef, à l’intérieur
du bureau.

Q. A la rue Buade?

R. A la rue Buade, au même endroit que
toutes les autres malles. C’est remis par le département de l’expédition.

Q. C’est là que vous faites votre
délivrance?

R. Oui.

La Cour:

Q. Au bureau central?

R. Au bureau central, M. le Juge.

Me Choquette C.R.

Q. Et une fois que cette délivrance est
faite par votre bureau de poste aux employés du gouvernement provincial,
avez-vous encore un control sur ces lettres, sur cette malle et ces courriers?

R. Non. Nous n’avons aucun contrôle, mais
nous coopérons avec le . . .

Q. Avez-vous des employés qui travaillent
au Parlement, du ministère des postes? R. Aucun.

* * *

[Page 41]

La Cour:

Q. On vous demande si, parce que cela n’est
pas compris dans la liste, vous pensez, vous êtes sous l’impressioni que ce
n’est pas un bureau de poste?

R. Je suis de l’opinion que ce n’est pas un
bureau de poste officiel.

* * *

Q. Où est-ce que cette lettre-là a été
délivrée par les autorités postales?

R. Dans leur paquet de malle destiné
au Parlement Provincial.

Q. A quel endroit l’avez-vous delivrée?

R. On l’a delivrée ici, au bureau de poste
de Québec.

Q. Et vous l’avez délivrée à qui?

R. * * * A leur employé autorisé là * * *

Q. Leur employé? quel employé?

R. L’employé des * * * du parlementi
provincial.

Q. Par des employés des postes que vous
avez délivré ça?

R. Bien * * * l’employé autorisé à venir
chereher la malle.

Q. Avez-vous livré ça à des employés du
Ministère des Postes, c’est ça que je vous demande?

Me Dorion C.R.,

Du Ministère Fédéral des postes?

Me Choquette C.R.,

Du Ministère fédéral des postes, Oui?

Du Ministère fédéral des postes, non.

It would, therefore, appear that delivery took
place and was completed, as contemplated by Dr. Coulter’s letter within the
central post office when the duly authorized messenger took out the parcel of
letters addressed to the Parliament Building. The dissenting judges, however,
seem to have reached the opinion that delivery took place only after it reached
Parliament and that it was still under the control of the Dominion authorities
between the main post office and the Parliament Building. This does not agree,
in my opinion, with the facts as they appear by the evidence of Morin, the only
person who really knows about the exact relationship in actual practice between
the Dominion Postal Service and the Parliament distribution office. I would say
that the control and responsibility of the Dominion post office authorities on
this particular letter ceased from the moment that it was delivered in the main
post office to the representative of the provincial authorities. Although my
views do not agree fully with the dissenting judges in appeal, as to the time
and place where delivery took place, I agree with them on the construction of
the statutory definition of “post letter.” For slightly different reasons, the
same conclusion is reached, to wit: in law, the letter was abstracted after it
had been delivered

[Page 42]

to the duly constituted agents of the provincial
authorities and it had passed out of the control of the Dominion Post Office;
the abstraction took place when it was no more a “post letter,” or “lettre
confiée à la poste.”

I am of opinion that the conviction should be
quashed and the appeal allowed.

Crocket J.—This is an appeal under s. 1023  of the Criminal Code  from a
majority judgment of the Court of King’s Bench of the province of Quebec
affirming a conviction made against the appellant in the Court of Sessions of
the Peace for the theft of a letter containing money “dans le bureau de poste
du Parlement” in the city of Quebec contrary to the provisions of s. 364  of the
Criminal Code . Dorion and Galipeault JJ. were the dissenting judges.

When the appeal came on for hearing in this
court Mr. Rivard for the Crown in pursuance of notice objected to the court’s
jurisdiction to entertain it on the ground that the dissent in the court below
was not on a question of law as provided by s. 1023  of the Criminal Code , and
moved to quash the appeal for that reason. As this objection appeared to
involve a consideration of the grounds of the appeal itself, the learned Chief
Justice suggested that it would be more convenient to allow the appeal to
proceed and hear counsel on the merits as well as on the jurisdictional
objection. The motion to quash and the appeal itself were, therefore, argued
together.

As to the motion to quash, Mr. Rivard contended
that the record of the dissent appearing in the entry of the formal judgment of
the court, under the provisions of s. 1013  of the Criminal Code , shewed on its
face that it was a dissent on a question of fact or on a question of mixed law
and fact.

This entry stated that Judges Dorion and
Galipeault dissented, holding that the charge of theft of a post letter is not
proven, and that the evidence only discloses theft of a sum of $1.50, entailing
a maximum penalty of six months.

While it may very well be said, if one looks
Only at the statement “that the charge of theft of a post letter is not
proven,” that it may indicate a dissent upon a pure question of fact of a mixed
question of law and fact, the

[Page 43]

words which immediately follow would seem to me
to shew that the real basis of the dissent was that the theft which the
evidence disclosed as having been committed by the defendant was not the theft
of a post letter within the meaning of s. 364  of the Criminal Code , for which he
would be liable to a minimum penalty of three years under the provisions of
that section.

However this may be, there seems to be no doubt
that this court will look at the notes or written reasons of dissenting judges,
and whenever necessary at the notes or reasons of the majority judges or any
other portion of the record to ascertain the real grounds upon which any
dissent is based, if the formal judgment of the court omits to state these
grounds specifically or fails to make them clear.

An examination of the written reasons for both
the majority and the dissenting judgments in the present case makes it quite
clear, as I read them, that the only question considered in the court below was
whether upon the undisputed facts disclosed by the evidence the Bureau de Poste
du Parlement, where the letter was stolen, was a “bureau de poste” or the
letter the appellant was charged with stealing there a “lettre confiée à la
poste” within the meaning of s. 364 of the French version of the Criminal Code 
or s. 2  (the interpretation section) of the Canada Post Office Act.

St. Jacques J., who, having been deputed by the
court for the purpose, signed the formal judgment containing the ground of
dissent as above stated, sets out in his own notes four grounds on which the
appeal was heard. All these he describes as “motifs de droit,” and states that
the facts are not in dispute. After pointing out, as to the first two grounds
relied on by the appellant, viz.: (1) The Bureau de Poste du Parlement was not
upon the evidence “un bureau de poste au sens de la loi,” (2) The letter the
appellant was charged with having stolen was not upon the evidence “une lettre’
confiée à la poste’ au sens de la loi,” that they were in effect one and the
same, His Lordship said that there was, therefore, only one point to be decided
on the appeal, i.e., “au sujet du sens qu’il faut donner, au regard de la loi,
aux mots lettre confiée a la poste.” He held, not only that the stolen letter
fell within the definition of a “lettre confiee a la poste” given

[Page 44]

in the interpretation section of the Canada Post
Office Act because it had been posted the previous day in the Quebec City
Post Office and was stolen before it had reached the addressee or other person
authorized to receive it for him, but also that the “Bureau de Poste du
Parlement,” though not a regular post office, fell within the definition of
“Bureau de poste” given in the same section of that Act as a place where
“lettres confiées à la poste” are received.

Létourneau J., in his notes, confirmed the
conviction for the reason that the bureau, where the letter was stolen, was a
“bureau de poste” in the sense which the Canada Post Office Act gives to
these words since that office was undoubtedly a place where “lettres confiées à
la poste” or other mailable matter were distributed, sorted, etc., within the
meaning of that statute.

Walsh J. concurred with the latter and the
accused’s appeal was, therefore, dismissed for the reasons indicated.

Dorion and Galipeault JJ. dissented from these
conclusions of the majority judges on the ground that the accused stole the
letter in a place which was not a “bureau de poste” and the letter not a
“lettre confiée à la poste,” within the meaning of the definition of these
expressions given in s. 2 of the Canada Post Office Act, for the reason
that upon the undisputed facts as disclosed by the evidence, the so-called
Parliament post office was officered and operated entirely by appointees of the
Quebec Provincial Government, over whom the Post Office Department of Canada
had no control, and that the letter in question, at the time it was stolen, had
ceased under the provisions of s. 2 of the Canada Post Office Act to be
a post letter within the meaning of that section.

Dorion J., in his notes, set out the provisions
of the Canada Post Office Act, which define “bureau de poste” and
“lettre confiée à la poste” as well as other provisions of that Act, and also
discussed a letter from the Deputy Postmaster-General under date of March 12,
1919, addressed to the then Postmaster of Quebec city regarding the request of
the Legislative Assembly for the installation of a post office in the
Parliament Building. This letter set forth the conditions under which the
proposed office should be instituted and the mail delivered from the Quebec city

[Page 45]

Post Office. Among the conditions stated were:
the proposed office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by
the rules and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada; that it
would be operated and officered by clerks appointed by authority of the
Legislative Assembly, who would obtain supplies of postage stamps from the city
post office and postal stations, etc., conveying the mail bags both ways
between the Quebec city Post Office and the Legislative Assembly without
expense to the Post Office Department of Canada in any way. The letter stated
that an office of this nature would not be recognized as a regular post office,
being simply a clearing house, as the Department could not undertake to
establish either a sub-office or a regular office in a separate institution
such as a Provincial Government building, as all post offices have to be for
the general service of the public and under the direct control of the
Department. It was also stated that a duly authorized messenger representing
all the Legislative Assembly departments would call at the Quebec city Post
Office and sign for all registered mail for all the departments, which he would
deliver as instructed to the several departments located in the Legislative
Assembly building; that the locked bag containing the ordinary mail would be
sent to the Legislative Assembly post office where it would be distributed and
messengers from the various branches call at that post office for the mail.

It is evident, therefore, that all the judges,
who heard the appeal in the Court of King’s Bench, treated the problem before
them, viz.: whether the accused was properly convicted of the offence with
which he was charged under s. 364  of the Criminal Code , as one which involved a
question or questions of law only inasmuch as all the facts relating thereto
were established by undisputed and undisputable evidence.

In my opinion they were right in doing so. No
question was involved on the appeal as to the weight or appreciation of
evidence by inference or otherwise as in Gauthier v. The King[1], where it was held by this court, assuming
that the question whether there was any evidence to support a conviction should
be deemed a question of law, the

[Page 46]

question whether the proper inference has been
drawn by the trial judge from facts established in evidence is really not a
question of law, but purely a question of fact for consideration. The
conviction of the appellant for the theft with which he was charged under s.
364  of the Criminal Code  admittedly could not properly have been made if the
Bureau de Poste du Parlement was not a “bureau de poste” within the meaning of
that section of the Code and of the interpretation section of the Canada Post
Office Act, or if the letter he was charged with stealing, at the time of
the theft, was not a “lettre confiée à la poste” within the meaning of those
statutory provisions, no matter what inferences may have been drawn from
established facts as to the culpability of the appellant in respect of the
commission of the theft of the letter itself. As to whether the place where the
theft was in fact committed was or was not such a bureau de poste or the stolen
letter such a letter depends entirely on the interpretation of the statutory
provisions referred to. The letter of the Deputy Post master-General of March
12, 1919, was produced by the Crown on the trial as evidence of the conditions
under which the Bureau de Poste du Parlement was instituted and was to be
operated. As regards its meaning and effect upon the two vital issues involved
in the appeal that also was for the decision of the trial court as a question
of law. These two questions are manifestly in my judgment questions of law
alone, and two of the judges of the Court of King’s Bench having dissented from
the majority judgment upon them, I am of opinion that the appellant has a right
to a further appeal to this court under the provisions of s. 1023 , and that the
motion to quash the appeal should be dismissed.

As to the merits of the appeal it is apparent
that s. 364  of the Criminal Code  creates an offence which relates to the
conduct of the postal service of Canada and that in virtue of the provisions of
s. 6 of the Code the words “bureau de poste” and “lettre confiée à la poste”
must be given the meaning assigned to them by s. 2 of the Post Office Act, c.
161, R.S.C., 1927. I am of opinion that the definition of “bureau de poste”
given in par. (1) of that section as embodying “a place where post letters or
other mailable matter are received or delivered, sorted, made up

[Page 47]

or despatched” or, as the French version states
it, “un lieu où les lettres confiées à la poste ou autres objets transmissibles
sont reçus ou délivrés, distribués, triés, formés en paquets ou expédiés,” must
be taken as necessarily implying a bureau or place which is under the control
and supervision of the Post Office Department of Canada. Otherwise any room or
place in any large business establishment which manitains a staff for the
receipt, classification, distribution, delivery or despatch of any letters
brought to the establishment by its own employees or stamped and addressed for
transit through the regular postal service would constitute a post office
within the meaning of the Post Office Act and of s. 364  of the Criminal
Code . I am of opinion also that the definition in the same section of the Post
Office Act of the words “post letter,” or, as it is in the French version,
“lettre confiée à la poste” and the proviso that a letter shall be deemed a
post letter from the time of its being deposited in any post office “to the
time of its being delivered to the person to whom it is addressed, or so long
as it remains in the post office or in any such letter box or is being carried
through the post” shew that the intention was that no letter should be deemed a
post letter within the meaning of the Post Office Act unless it be in
the custody and control of some post office or branch of the postal service,
which is under the direct control of the Post Office Department of Canada.

Although the letter of March 12, 1919, from the
Deputy Postmaster-General to the Postmaster at Quebec regarding the agreement
for the establishment of the “bureau de poste du Parlement” says that that
office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules
and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada, its whole tenor, in my
judgment, shews that it is in no sense a post office in the true sense of the Post
Office Act, but simply a clearing house for the reception and distribution
of outgoing and incoming mail for the convenience of the Legislative Assembly
and the Departments of the Provincial Government situated in the Parliament
Building. Indeed the letter explicitly states that an office of this nature
would not be recognized as a regular post office, “as the Department could
not undertake to establish either a sub-

[Page 48]

office or a regular office in a separate
institution such as a Provincial Government building, as all post offices
have to be for the general service of the public and under the direct control
of the Department.”

If I am right in my construction of the two
material paragraphs of the Canada Post Office Act, it follows that the
“bureau de poste du Parlement” is not a “bureau de poste” within the meaning of
s. 364  of the Criminal Code , and also that the letter which the defendant was
charged with stealing therein was not a “lettre confiée à la poste” at the time
of the theft in the sense of that expression as given in s. 2 of the Canada Post
Office Act. The letter at that time was neither in a “post office” nor
“being carried through the post,” the Post Office Department’s control and
responsibility of and for it having ceased upon its delivery at the so-called
“bureau de poste” which is officered and operated by appointees of the
Provincial Government entirely at the latter’s expense and over which neither
the Quebec city post office nor the Post Office Department had any control.

For these reasons I would allow the appeal and
quash the conviction in so far as it applies to an offence against s. 364 .

Kerwin J.—The accused was charged under section 364  of the Criminal Code 
that he “a volé une lettre dans la bureau de poste du parlement,” and the
question is what construction is to be placed upon the expression “un bureau de
poste” in clause (6) of section 364 , which, for this purpose, by virtue of
section 6 of the Code, is to have the meaning assigned to it by section 2,
paragraph (l) of the Post Office Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 161. That paragraph states:—

(l) “post
office” means any building, room, post office, railway car, street letter box,
street stamp-vending box, receiving box or other receptacle or place where post
letters or other mailable matter are received or delivered, sorted, made up or
despatched.

It is to be noted that not only does it include
a building, etc., where post letters are received, etc., but also a building,
etc, where other mailable matter is received, etc. By section 2 (h):—

“mailable matter” includes any letter,
packet, parcel, newspaper, book or other thing which, by this Act or by any
regulation made in pursuance of it, may be sent by post.

[Page 49]

That is “post office” means any building, etc.,
where any letter which may be sent by post is received, etc. Now it cannot have
been intended that any letter which may be sent by post is in a
post office unless it is in a building, room, etc., which building,
room, etc., is under the control of the Postmaster-General as part of the
postal service of Canada. In my opinion that is the construction to be given to
section 364 of the Code.

Section 4 of the Post Office Act enacts:—

4. There shall be at the seat of government
of Canada a department, known as the Post Office Department, for the
superintendence and management, under the direction of the Postmaster-General,
of the postal service of Canada.

By section 7, the Postmaster-General has
authority to do a number of things. By section 35 he has the sole and exclusive
privilege of conveying, receiving, collecting, sending and delivering letters
within Canada. By section 39 he may establish one or more branch post offices.

It may be assumed that the Postmaster-General
would be justified, under his powers, in permitting certain actions to be done
to accelerate the work of the postal service proper, such as, for instance,
allowing private commercial houses to collect all the mailable matter of its
employees and even such as has been deposited by members of the public in
receptacles provided by the concerns themselves. He might authorize them to use
a machine which would indicate that the postage had been paid. He might permit
the inhabitants of an outlying settlement to deal with mailable matter in
various ways. He might not object to the sign “Post Office” being used under
certain conditions. And it may be assumed that he could from time to time
revoke or alter any directions given, or regulations made, by him with respect
to such matters.

There is no dispute as to what he has done in
the present case. There is in evidence a letter from the Deputy
Postmaster-General to the Postmaster at Quebec, and there is certain oral
testimony bearing on the question which is uncontradicted. To summarize from
such evidence:—

1. Those engaged in what is called the
Parliamentary Post Office are employees of the Provincial Government and not of
the Post Office Department; as are also the couriers who transport the bags
between the Quebec Post Office and the Legislative Assembly Building.

[Page 50]

2. There is a “primary sorting” in the building.

3. Receipts are given for mailable matter which
the senders decide to register.

4. At one time money orders were issued although
the authority for so doing has since been withdrawn.

5. To quote from the letter of the Deputy
Postmaster-General:—

In brief, the Legislative Assembly Post
Office would be a self-contained operating institution governed by the rules
and regulations of the Post Office Department of Canada.

But

An office of this nature would not be
recognized as a regular post office, being simply a clearing house, as the
Department could not undertake to establish either a sub-office or a regular
office in a separate institution such as Provincial Government building, as all
post offices have to be for the service of the general public, and under the
direct control of the Department.

The office would not be a postal station,
but a clearing house, similar to that conducted by the Federal Parliament and
applicable to the various Legislative Assemblies. In this case postal note,
money orders and savings bank business could not be put into effect, as the
Assembly Post Office would not be a regular post office, nor published in the
Canada Official Postal Guide.

Bearing in mind all these considerations, the
quarters in the Legislative Assembly Building in Quebec, set aside by the
provincial authorities, cannot be said, in my opinion, to be part of the postal
service of Canada even though what was done was by the consent or authority of
the Postmaster-General.

However, what we are asked to do is to construe
an expression used by Parliament in describing an offence. Parliament indeed
has provided for various offences which may be termed “postal offences” as, for
example, section 365 of the Code; and it has seen fit to differentiate between
the punishments that may be imposed for such offences. We are not concerned
wiht the reason for such distinctions. Unless the courts below are correct in
their interpretation of the section under which the accused was charged, he is
entitled to have the conviction set aside.

A motion was made to dismiss the appeal for want
of jurisdiction but I am of opinion that this appeal is on a question of law on
which there has been dissent in the Court of King’s Bench, as provided by
section 1023  of the Criminal Code . A perusal of the dissenting judgment
satisfies me that the dissent was on the proper construction of section 364 of
the Code. There are no facts in dispute

[Page 51]

and it is not a “question whether the proper
inference has been drawn by the trial judge from facts established in evidence”
as in Gauthier v. The King[2].
This Court had to consider what was a question of law when the proper
construction of a statutory provision was involved in Township of Tisdale v. Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mines[3]. Referring to the finding made by the
Ontario Railway and Municipal Board that the property attempted to be assessed
was situate on “mineral land,” the judgment states at page 323:—

It seems., as found by the Supreme Court of
Ontario, that upon the evidence adduced and the findings of the Board, we would
be precluded from interfering therewith if we agree in law with their view as
to the meaning of the statute. The construction of a statutory enactment is a
question of law, while the question of whether the particular matter or thing
is of such a nature or kind as to fall within the legal definition of its term
is a question of fact.

In Loblaw Groceterias Co. Ltd. v. City
of Toronto[4], the
Court, at page 254, dealt with the argument that

the courts below having reached the
conclusion that the land and building were used as distribution premises, this
is a finding of fact with which we ought not to interfere.

The judgment proceeds:—

But it is a question of law that is made
the subject-matter of the right of appeal from the County Judge upon a stated
case and we are bound to determine upon the proper construction of the
amendment whether or not upon the facts stated the land and building are caught
by the increased rate of assessment.

I have not lost sight of what the Court was
dealing with in the two cases cited and I am not unaware of the danger of
relying upon statements extracted from a judgment without relating them to the
facts of the particular case, but the principles therein declared appeal to me
as affording a criterion which may usefully be followed in arriving at a
conclusion in this case.

It was stated in the dissenting judgment that
while the conviction should be set aside, the accused should be found guilty of
some other offence. The only other offence suggested is one which would carry
with it a sentence which the accused has already served, and under the
circumstances, therefore, I would restrict our judgment to allowing the appeal
and setting aside the conviction.

Appeal allowed and conviction quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Culpable homicide—As to reduction from murder to
manslaughter—Provocation—Cr. Code, s. 261—Acts of third person—Directions to
jury—Questions for jury.

An appeal by the Crown from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, [1937] O.R. 693, ordering a new trial of accused (who had
been convicted at trial on a charge of murder) on the ground of misdirection or
failure of proper direction by the trial judge in charging the jury on the question
of provocation, was dismissed.

The law with regard to provocation as embodied in s. 261 of
the Cr. Code does not contemplate the extension of the relative lenity
(in reducing culpable homicide from murder to manslaughter) to a case in which
provocation received from a third person becomes the occasion of an act of
homicide against a victim who, as the offender knows and fully realizes, was
not in any way concerned in the provocation. But acts of provocation committed
by a third person, which might be sufficient to reduce the offence to
manslaughter if the victim had in fact participated in them, may have the same
effect where the offence against the victim is committed by the accused under
the belief that the victim was a party to those acts, although the victim was
not implicated in them in fact. (Brown’s case, 1 Leech C.C. 148, and Hall’s
case, 21 Cr. A.R. 48, cited and discussed.)

In the present case, the trial judge ought to have asked the
jury to consider whether, in the blindness of his passion aroused by his
quarrel with the husband of Mrs. S., the accused, suddenly observing Mrs. S.
(the victim of the act now in question) within a few feet of the scene of the
quarrel and of his mortal assault on the husband, attacked her on the
assumption that she was involved in the acts of the husband and daughter. It
was a question for the jury whether (a) the acts relied upon as
constituting provocation were calculated to deprive an ordinary man of
self-control to such an extent as to cause an attack upon Mrs. S. of such a
character as that delivered by the accused, and (b) whether in fact the
accused was by reason of what occurred deprived of his self-control to such a
degree; and in his attack upon Mrs. S. was acting upon such provocation on a
sudden and before his passion had time to cool, and under the assumption that
she was involved therein.

APPEAL by the Attorney-General of Ontario (under s. 1023 (2) 
of the Criminal Code , as amended by 25-26 Geo. V (1935), c. 56, s. 16)
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
which (Fisher and Henderson JJ.A. dissenting) allowed the accused’s appeal

[Page 19]

against his conviction of murder at his trial before McFarland
J. with a jury and set aside the conviction and ordered a retrial, on the
ground of misdirection or failure of proper direction by the trial judge in
addressing the jury on the question of provocation.

W.B. Common K.C. and E.H. Lancaster K.C. for the
appellant.

Peter White K.C. and H.M. Rogers for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

DUFF C.J.—We have come to the conclusion that the order directing
a new trial should not be disturbed. As there is to be a new trial, we think it
better to abstain from a discussion of the facts.

The controversy on the appeal concerns the application of section
261  of the Criminal Code , the text of which we quote:

Culpable homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may be
reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so in the heat of
passion caused by sudden provocation.

2. Any wrongful act or insult, of such a nature as to be
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, may be
provocation if the offender acts upon it on the sudden, and before there has
been time for his passion to cool.

3. Whether or not any particular wrongful act or insult
amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked was actually
deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he received,
shall be questions of fact: Provided that no one shall be held to give
provocation to another by doing that which he had a legal right to do, or by
doing anything which the offender incited him to do in order to provide the
offender with an excuse for killing or doing bodily harm to any person.

We think it right to emphasize that this section deals with the
conditions under which “culpable homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may
be reduced to manslaughter,” because the act of the accused was committed “in
the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.”

The provocation contemplated by the section neither justifies nor
excuses the act of homicide. But the law accounts the act and the violent
feelings which prompted it less blameable because of the passion aroused by the
provocation, leaving the offender in a condition in which he was not at the
critical “moment the master of his own understanding,” to quote the phrase of
Tindal C.J. in

[Page 20]

Hayward’s case[2],
adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeals in Hall’s case[3];
though still sufficiently blame-able to merit punishment—and it may be
punishment of high severity—but not the extreme punishment of death. We do not
think that the law, as embodied in section 261 , contemplates the extension of
this relative lenity to a case in which provocation received from one person
becomes the occasion of an act of homicide against another who, as the offender
knows and fully realizes, was not in any way concerned in the provocation. We
do not think section 261  contemplates such a case, for example, as Simpson’s
case[4].

On the other hand, the law has recognized that an offender under
the dominion of a passion provoked by wrong or insult may in some circumstances
attack a person not in any way concerned with the act of provocation, under the
full belief that he has been so; and such circumstances have been held to be
sufficient to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.

Brown’s case[5] would
appear, from the report in 1 East’s Pleas of the Crown, at p. 246, to have
proceeded upon this ground.

Hall’s case[6] may
have been decided upon similar considerations. There is nothing in any of the
reports of the case indicating that there was any direct evidence of the
participation of the victim in the attack on the accused upon which the latter
relied as constituting provocation, or even that the victim was present at the
time. It was held that the jury ought to have been asked to consider the issue
of provocation and, accordingly, the court reduced the verdict of murder to
manslaughter, although, obviously, as Lord Hewart observes, there were grave
difficulties in the way of this defence. There was evidence from which it might
have been inferred, if the story of the accused was accepted, that the offender
acted upon the assumption that the victim had been one of his assailants. We
are disposed to think, after considering the judgment with care, that the Court
of Criminal Appeals did not regard the

[Page 21]

actual participation by the victim in the alleged assault upon
the accused as an essential element in the defence of provocation.

True it is that in these cases there was an affray and, both in Brown’s
case[7] and in Hall’s
case[8],
the alleged provocation consisted in a violent assault upon the accused. We
think, however, that section 261  of the Criminal Code  leaves exclusively
to the tribunal of fact, as an issue of fact, the question whether any
particular “wrongful act or insult” is of such a character as to constitute
provocation for the purposes of the section; at least subject to the condition
expressed in the proviso to the third sub-section. And we think, moreover, as
regards the source from which the provocation proceeds, that acts of
provocation committed by a third person, which might be sufficient to reduce
the offence to manslaughter if the victim had in fact participated in them, may
have the same effect where the offence against the victim is committed by the
accused under the belief that the victim was a party to those acts, although
not implicated in them in fact.

We think the trial judge ought to have asked the jury to consider
whether, in the blindness of his passion, aroused by the quarrel with the
husband, the accused, suddenly observing the wife within a few feet of the
scene of the quarrel and of his mortal assault on the husband, attacked her on
the assumption that she was involved in the acts of the husband and daughter.

We think it was a question for the jury whether (a) the
acts relied upon as constituting provocation were calculated to deprive an
ordinary man of self-control to such an extent as to cause an attack upon Mrs.
Seabright of such a character as that delivered by the accused; and (b)
whether in fact the accused was by reason of what occurred deprived of his self‑control
to such a degree; and in his attack upon Mrs. Seabright was acting upon such
provocation on a sudden and before his passion had time to cool, and under the
assumption that she was involved therein.

At the new trial the presiding judge will, no doubt, impress upon
the jury the importance of considering with great care the first of these
questions; but he will, of course, instruct the jury that, on the ultimate
issue, they must be

[Page 22]

satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of
murder before convicting him of that crime. For these reasons, the appeal is
dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Jury trial—Assessment of damages in
negligence action—New trial ordered on ground that damages
excessive—Jurisdiction of appellate court—Order for new trial set aside.

Where in an action for negligence the damages
have been assessed by a jury, an appellate court has no jurisdiction in respect
of the amount awarded to rehear the case and control the verdict of the jury.
The court is not a court of review for that purpose. If, viewing the evidence
as a whole, an appellate court can see plainly that the amount of damages is in
law indefensible, or that the trial has been unsatisfactory by reason of
misdirection or wrongful admission or rejection of evidence, or if it is
demonstrable that the jury have or must have misunderstood the evidence or
taken into account matters which could not legally affect their verdict, the
court may grant a new trial for the reassessment of the damages. This is not to
be taken, however, as an exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which a
new trial may be granted for such a purpose. The verdict ought to be set aside
in any case in which an appellate court finds it clearly established that the
jury had misunderstood or disregarded their duty.

Per Kerwin J.—When
an appellate court cannot agree with the jury’s estimate of the amount of
damages, “the rule of conduct” for that court when considering whether a
verdict should be set aside on the ground that the damages are excessive, “is
as nearly as possible the same as when the court is asked to set aside a
verdict on the ground that it is against the weight of evidence.” Praed v.
Graham (24 Q.B.D. 53) approved.

APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1],
reversing the judgment of the trial judge, with a jury, awarding $5,392.30 as
damages resulting from an automobile accident and ordering a new trial limited
to the assessment of damages (unless the parties consented to a reduction of
the general damages from $5,000 to $2,000), upon the ground that the amount of
the damages fixed by the jury was grossly excessive.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the judgment now reported.

J. M. Stevenson K.C. for the appellant.

Thos. N. Phelan K.C. and Brenton O’Brien
for the respondent.

[Page 53]

The judgment of Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by

Davis J.—The plaintiff (appellant) was a passenger in a public motor car
owned and operated by the defendant company (respondent) on an occasion when
the car suddenly left the travelled highway and went into the ditch. The
plaintiff claimed damages in this action for physical injuries alleged to have
been suffered as a result of what occurred. Liability was denied. The action
was tried with a jury and on the answers of the jury to certain questions
submitted to them the learned trial judge entered judgment against the
defendant for $392.30 special
damages and $5,000 general
damages. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[2] and that court affirmed the liability but
ordered a new trial limited to the assessment of damages (unless the parties
consented to a reduction of the general damages from $5,000 to $2,000) upon
the ground that the amount of the damages fixed by the jury was grossly
excessive. Both parties appealed from that judgment to this Court.

The motor car was not a regular bus model but
was an old seven-passenger car that had been driven for 200,000 miles and had been put into service as a public
conveyance. There was evidence that the accident was caused by a break
occurring in the steering apparatus which put the car out of control of the
driver and there was evidence that part of the steering apparatus had been
severely worn and was in a bad state of disrepair. On the other hand, there was
evidence, on behalf of the defendant, that the practice had been to have an
almost daily inspection of the car and that the car had in fact been inspected
and the steering apparatus found in good condition three days before the
accident. The jury were of course entitled to disbelieve this evidence if they
chose. They found that the defendant had been guilty of negligence and that the
negligence was “that proper inspection of the vehicle was not carried out.”

At the time of the accident and for some time
thereafter it is plain that the plaintiff did not regard the physical injuries
which he suffered as of very much account. He

[Page 54]

was a war veteran with a progressive disability
which had led to the increase of his pension from a ten per cent disability to
a thirty per cent disability and at the time of the accident an application
from him for a larger disability pension was pending. After the accident he
consulted several doctors, one after the other, over a period of some months.
His substantial claim for damages at the trial was made upon his story that he
had suffered very considerably from headaches since the accident occurred and
that they had resulted in a condition of physical weakness and in a lack of
power of concentration on his work which had seriously affected his earning
capacity. His business was that of an insurance adjuster. It appears that a
diet which one of the doctors prescribed for him had counteracted the headaches
but the evidence does not disclose what effect if any the diet had upon his
general health.

Counsel for the defendant contends that there is
no liability. This contention is put firstly upon the ground that, while the
jury found negligence, the answer they gave as to what constituted the negligence,
i.e., the absence of proper inspection of the vehicle, was not in itself
negligence and that the very answer negatived all other acts of alleged
negligence. We did not require to hear counsel for the plaintiff on this point.
While it may well be that want of inspection is not by itself negligence unless
there was either some original defect or a state of disrepair which inspection
would have disclosed, where, as here, the evidence pointed to a known defect or
condition of disrepair in the steering apparatus, the language of the jury read
and construed in the light of the evidence and the charge can only be
interpreted fairly as meaning that the jury thought that a proper and
sufficient inspection would have disclosed the full extent of the faulty condition
and that its repair would have avoided the event that happened. A high degree
of care is required on the part of common carriers and the lack of inspection
as found by the jury was, in view of the evidence, plainly a sufficient finding
of negligence.

The mention of an insurance company in the case,
which was one of the grounds of the defendant’s appeal to the Court of Appeal
for Saskatchewan, was not pressed in that

[Page 55]

court, perhaps because the complaining party
realized that it was as remiss as its opponent in this regard. In any case, as
the point was not pressed in the court below, it was not open to the defendant
in this Court.

The main proposition advanced by counsel for the
defendant before us was that on the evidence no causal relation is proved
between the headaches and the accident —that the evidence is so vague that it
could not reasonably be concluded that the headaches were the direct result of
the accident. But there was some evidence, if believed, sufficient to connect
the headaches with the accident. The weight of the evidence was a question
solely for the jury and in an admirably clear and direct charge the learned
trial judge put that question to the jury as “the big question” to be decided
by them.

If you find he was not suffering from a
headache before the accident and that he struck his head on the occasion in
question against the back of the front seat of the car and has been suffering
headaches since then, it would be a fair inference that it was the blow on the
head from the back of the front seat that caused them; and in that case the
evidence of Dr. McConnell would be of some importance. But before using the
evidence of Dr. McConnell at all you must find that the headaches did not exist
before the accident and that he did not suffer from headaches before the
accident. Because the evidence of Dr. McConnell is not going to be of any
assistance to you in coming to a conclusion as to whether he had these before
or after. He says: “Assuming the truth of his history”; that is, assuming the
truth of what the plaintiff tells him, then he says: “The condition I found
could be due to the accident.” But he also says “The condition which I found
may have existed long before the accident.” So that as to whether he was
suffering from those injuries before the accident or whether they commenced
after the accident, the evidence of Dr. McConnell does not help you one way or
the other. If you find they were non-existent before the accident, then you
consider the evidence of Dr. McConnell who says he found the third ventricle
was slightly larger than normal, that the left frontal region was abnormal,
there was a larger space than normal, and that they were liable to cause
headaches.

The Jury could not have assessed the general
damages at $5,000 unless they had accepted the plaintiff’s evidence that the
headaches were the direct result of the accident because the other complaints
of the plaintiff were admittedly of trifling significance. The jury’s finding
of liability, affirmed as it was by the Court of Appeal, must stand.

Once liability has been established, any views
as to the weakness of the evidence regarded from the point of view of liability
(the weight of which evidence, we repeat, was for the jury) must not influence
the Court on the amount

[Page 56]

of compensation for the injuries. While it may
be that the general damages were awarded on a generous scale, there was no firm
ground, in our opinion, on which the Court of Appeal was entitled to set aside
the jury’s assessment. This was essentially a case for a jury and it is quite
impossible for the Court to say that the amount of the damages fixed by the
jury was so large that the jury reviewing the whole of the evidence reasonably
could not properly have arrived at that amount. Lord Wright in the House of
Lords in Mechanical and General Inventions Co. v. Austin[3] said:

The appellate court is never the judge of
fact in a case where the constitutional judge of fact is the jury. For the
appellate court to set aside the verdict of a jury as being against the weight
of evidence, merely because the court does not agree with it, would, in my
judgment, be to usurp the functions of the jury and to substitute their own
opinion for that of the jury: that would be quite wrong. Much more is necessary
in order to justify the setting aside of a jury’s verdict where there is some
evidence to support it.

And at p. 377:

The jury were, as the Lord Chancellor
explains, properly directed and had all the facts fully before them. In
considering their award on damages, that view of the evidence most favourable
to their finding must be taken, not the view most adverse to it, if or where
two views are competent. It is true that the damages awarded ran into big
figures, but damages cannot be treated as excessive merely because they are
large. Excess implies some standard which has been exceeded.

The authorities are numerous but we might
usefully refer to the judgment of the Privy Council in McHugh v. Union
Bank of Canada[4]. That
was an Alberta case. Beck, J., sitting without a jury, assessed the damages (a
mortgagee’s negligence case) at $2,800. The Alberta court of appeal set aside
the assessment but granted to the plaintiff the option to have it referred back
to the clerk of the court at Calgary to take an account within prescribed
limits of what damage, if any, the plaintiff had suffered by the negligence of
the defendants. Upon appeal to this Court, the majority (Duff and Anglin JJ.
dissenting) affirmed the order permitting a reference at the plaintiff’s option
but varied the directions as to the mode of assessing the damages. Upon further
appeal to the Privy Council, the assessment made by the trial judge was
restored. Lord Moulton, who delivered the judgment of the Board, said at p.
309:

[Page 57]

The tribunal which has the duty of making
such assessment, whether it be judge or jury, has often a difficult task, but
it must do it as best it can, and unless the conclusions to which it comes from
the evidence before it are clearly erroneous they should not be interfered with
on appeal, inasmuch as the courts of appeal have not the advantage of seeing
the witnesses—a matter which is of grave importance in drawing conclusions as
to quantum of damage from the evidence that they give. Their Lordships cannot
see anything to justify them in coming to the conclusion that Beck J.’s
assessment of the damages is erroneous, and they are therefore of opinion that
it ought not to have been disturbed on appeal.

The importance of that case lies in the fact
that the assessment had been made by the trial judge himself and the court of
appeal had jurisdiction to rehear the case and to substitute their findings for
his findings. But notwithstanding that both the court of appeal of Alberta and the Supreme Court of Canada had
seen fit to set aside the assessment of damages made by the trial judge, the
Privy Council restored the assessment. That course undoubtedly would not have
been taken had the Privy Council not concluded that the two appellate courts
below had erred in principle in interfering with the assessment made by the
trial judge.

In the case before us, however, the damages had
been assessed by a jury and the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction in respect
of the amount awarded to rehear the case and control the verdict of the jury.
The court is not a court of review for that purpose. If, viewing the evidence
as a whole, the Court of Appeal can see plainly that the amount of damages is
in law indefensible, or that the trial has been unsatisfactory by reason of
misdirection or wrongful admission or rejection of evidence, or if it is
demonstrable that the jury have or must have misunderstood the evidence or
taken into account matters which could not legally affect their verdict, the
court may grant a new trial for the reassessment of the damages. This, of
course, is not an exhaustive statement of the circumstances in which a new
trial may be granted for such a purpose. The verdict ought to be set aside in
any case in which the court finds it clearly established that the jury have
misunderstood or disregarded their duty.

In this case the jury were properly directed and
had all the facts before them and there is no reason for inferring that they
took into account any irrelevant consideration in arriving at the amount of the
damages.

[Page 58]

The appeal must be allowed and the cross-appeal
must be dismissed and the judgment at the trial restored, with costs
throughout.

Kerwin J.—The cross-appeal was practically disposed of on the argument. The
evidence at the trial was directed to the condition of the automobile and the
answer of the jury must be considered in view of that evidence and of the
judge’s charge. I have no doubt that so reading the jury’s answer, it is a
sufficient finding of negligence.

As to the appeal of the plaintiff on the
question of the amount of damages, I must confess that I was much impressed by
Mr. Phelan’s contention that there was not shown to be any connection between
the accident and the headaches of which the plaintiff complained. That argument
is based to a great extent upon the care with which Dr. McConnell answered the
questions put to him upon the precise point. However, a perusal of the evidence
since the argument satisfies me that while Dr. McConnell was not as emphatic as
some expert witnesses in other cases, there was no doubt as to his opinion, the
reasons for which he gave simply and clearly. The jury were entitled to give
effect to his opinion and, of course, so far as it was predicated upon the
symptoms of the plaintiff, as told by the latter to the doctor, the plaintiff
was in the witness box and was heard and seen by the jury. The jury apparently
accepted the plaintiff’s story and their finding cannot be disturbed.

Once granted these premises, I am unable to see
how, on the evidence, the amount of the verdict can be challenged. A claim
based upon headaches may be suspect but the evidence of the plaintiff as to his
loss of earnings, the fact of the encephalographies and the prescribed diets,
and the plaintiff’s testimony as to his pain and suffering, coupled with the
evidence of Dr. McConnell that the plaintiff would have pain, were all
questions for the jury to consider. As the Lord Chancellor stated in Mechanical
and General Inventions Co. Ltd. and Lehwess v. Austen[5]:

The jury were the proper constitutional
tribunal to assess the damages and it is impossible to say that they have gone
so wrong that their (assessment must be set aside. It is not a case merely for
a nominal but for substantial damages, of which the jury were the judges.

[Page 59]

Part of Lord Wright’s judgment in the same case,
at page 374, has been transcribed and referred to by this Court in McCannell
v. McLean[6], and I
think that the following quotation from the extract,—

Thus the question in truth is not whether
the verdict appeals to the appellate court to be right but whether it is such
as to show that the jury have failed to perform their duty.

is particularly appropriate to the case at bar.

Neither from a perusal of the evidence and the
judge’s charge nor from a careful consideration of the reasons for judgment of
the learned judges in the Court of Appeal can I conclude that the jury in this
case have failed to do their duty. With great respect I read the latter as
indicating nothing more than that the learned judges in the Court of Appeal
could not agree with the jury’s estimate of the amount of damages, and that is
not in my view a correct method of approach. In the Mechanical and General
Inventions case, Lord Wright, at page 378, points out that in Praed v.
Graham[7], Lord
Esher had stated that “the rule of conduct” for the appellate court when
considering whether a verdict should be set aside on the ground that the
damages are excessive,

is as nearly as possible the same as where
the court is asked to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is against the
weight of evidence.

I would allow the appeal with costs throughout
and dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.

Appeal allowed with costs.

Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.

C.L. Yoerger for the appellant.

C.L. Snyder K.C. and N.L. Croome for the Attorney General
of Ontario.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

KERWIN J.—William Schmidt appeals against the affirmance of his
conviction for murder by the Court of Appeal for Ontario based on the
dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Laidlaw. By section 1023 of the Criminal
Code  our jurisdiction is limited to any question of law expressed in such
dissent.

Schmidt was jointly indicted and tried, together with three other
persons. Two of the latter (as well as the accused) had made written
confessions which, after the usual inquiry by the trial judge, were admitted in
evidence. Mr. Justice Laidlaw’s first matter of dissent is that the trial judge
“ought to have warned the jury immediately each statement was admitted, to not
pay any attention or give any weight whatsoever to that evidence except as against
the person who made the

[Page 439]

statement.” This is an advisable practice but there is no such
absolute rule. A trial judge, during the course of the trial of two or more
persons jointly indicted and tried, must make it clear to the jury that a statement
by one of the accused is evidence only against him. This, as will appear, the
trial judge did in the present case.

It is doubtful if Mr. Justice Laidlaw was of the opinion that,
although no application for a separate trial was made, one should have been
directed by the trial judge proprio motu at some late stage of the
trial, but certainly he was of opinion that there was “a prejudice and
substantial injustice” to Schmidt. The trial judge, of course, exercised no
discretion because he was not asked to do so. Assuming that when that occurs a
Court of Appeal may set aside a conviction and direct a separate trial if it is
of the opinion that an appellant has not had a fair trial, and assuming that a
dissent on a matter of that kind is a question of law, this is not a case where
such an order is warranted. The record discloses that, after the trial judge
had passed upon the admissibility of the confessions and they were about to be
placed in evidence before the jury, the following occurred:—

Mr. FITCH [who was counsel for Schmidt]: My Lord, I would
suggest that it should be made perfectly plain that these statements made by
Tillonen and Tony [meaning Anthony Skrypnyk] are evidence as against them and
not against Schmidt.

His LORDSHIP: The jury will so be instructed, Mr. Fitch.

Mr. FITCH: I mean, it is going in as if it was evidence
against all the defendants, when it is not.

His LORDSHIP: Quite right.

On three occasions in his charge, the trial judge referred to
this matter as follows:—

I should tell you further, as has been mentioned by some of
the defence counsel in addressing the jury, that the statement made by each of
the accused is only evidence against that accused. Whatever he may have said in
that statement against the other accused, it is not evidence against such
other. In dealing with those statements I trust that you will keep that in
mind.

* * *

Now, Anthony Skrypnyk made a statement. As I said before,
these statements are only evidence against the person making them.

* * *

Tillonen also made a statement, only evidence against
himself.

We are unable to agree in Mr. Justice Laidlaw’s description of
these references as “meagre” or that the appellant did not have a fair trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Murder—Charge of trial judge—Whether defence
theory adequately put to jury—Reduction from murder to manslaughter—Criminal
Code , s. 1024(1) .

At his second trial for murder, ordered by this Court ([1951]
S.C.R. 115), the appellant was again found guilty. The crime was committed in
June 1947. The deceased was returning home from the City of Quebec in a taxicab
driven by the appellant. He was in the back seat with two other passengers, one
Vallières and one Légaré. Another
passenger was in the front seat. There was some beer drinking during the ride
and at one time the deceased, who had become noisy and quarrelsome, threatened
to strike Légaré with a bottle. The car was stopped;
the appellant and the three rear passengers got out; the deceased was then hit
with a bottle by both Vallières and Légaré
and when he was on the ground and unconscious, the appellant struck him
with his fists and feet. He was then put on the floor of the car where he
remained without making a sound, except for one prolonged sigh, until the
appellant, with or without the help of Vallières and Légaré, is alleged to have thrown him in a river. The theory
of the Crown was that the deceased died as a result of the blows struck during
the fighting and not by drowning. The appellant's conviction was affirmed by a
majority in the Court of Appeal for Quebec.

Held: The trial judge, by omitting to review that part
of the evidence which showed that the deceased could have died before he was
thrown in the river, left the jury with the impression that the deceased died
by drowning rather than as the result of the blows. The theory of the defence
was, therefore, not adequately put to the jury, and the conviction should be
quashed.

Held further: Under the exceptional circumstances of
this case, and specially in view of the theory on which the case for the Crown
was based, a verdict of manslaughter should be substituted for the jury's
verdict.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1,
affirming, Pratte and Hyde JJ.A. dissenting, the appellant's conviction upon a
charge of murder. Vallières and Légaré,
who were alleged to have participated with the appellant in the
commission of the crime, pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter after a
verdict of murder, pronounced against Légaré, had been
quashed by the Court of Appeal for Quebec.

[Page 412]

A. Chevalier Q.C. for the appellant.

N. Dorion Q.C. and P. Flynn for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Taschereau, J.:—L'appelant Roger Lizotte a été accusé d'avoir assassiné Gérard Beaumont
dans la nuit du 14 au 15 juin 1947. Le crime aurait été commis au cours d'un
voyage entre Québec et St. Gérard de Magella, conjointement avec Maurice Légaré
et Auguste Vallières. Des plaidoyers de ""coupables de manslaughter"" de
la part de Légaré et Vallières ont été acceptés par la Couronne après qu'un
verdict de meurtre, prononcé contre Légaré, eût été cassé par la Cour du Banc
de la Reine. Tous deux ont été respectivement condamnés à huit années de
pénitencier. Quant à l'appelant, qui a été également une première fois trouvé
coupable de meurtre, il a aussi obtenu un nouveau procès par jugement de cette
Cour 2,
puis condamné une seconde fois. Il appelle maintenant du jugement de la Cour du
Banc de la Reine 3 qui
a refusé son pourvoi, MM. les Juges Pratte et Hyde dissidents.

Le soir du 14 juin 1947, l'appelant, domicilié
à Val St. Michel, et qui est conducteur de taxi, est descendu à Québec en
compagnie de Maurice Légaré, Auguste Vallières et Armand Demers, trois
bûcherons employés à la Rivière aux Pins, près du Lac St-Joseph. Après qu'ils
eussent bu chacun quelques bouteilles de bière dans une taverne locale, les
compagnons se sont séparés, pour se retrouver vers 11 heures P.M. à un endroit
convenu sur la rue St-Roch. A ce lieu de rendez-vous, il y avait cependant une
cinquième personne, Gérard Beaumont, qui devait être la victime de cette
malheureuse tragédie. La preuve ne révèle pas clairement si Beaumont est monté
volontairement dans la voiture de Lizotte, ou s'il a été contraint par force de
le faire. Mais à tout événement, les cinq voyageurs sont repartis vers 11 heures
P.M. se dirigeant vers le chemin de Valcartier, pour apparemment gagner leurs
domiciles respectifs.

En route, il y eut de nouvelles consommations
de bière, et Beaumont, sans doute excité par les liqueurs alcooliques, était
tapageur et chantait. Au lieu de se calmer à la demande des autres passagers,
il menaça de frapper Légaré

[Page 413]

d'une bouteille, et ce n'est que grâce à
l'intervention de Vallières qu'il ne donna pas suite à son projet. Il semble
que d'un commun accord, Lizotte, Légaré et Vallières ont voulu faire un mauvais
parti à Beaumont, car Lizotte a arrêté sa voiture, il en est descendu, de même
que Légaré et Vallières. On en fit sortir Beaumont, et là sur le bord du chemin
conduisant à St-Gérard, Vallières et Légaré ont tous deux frappé Beaumont d'un
coup de bouteille sur la tête. Alors qu'il gisait à terre, sans connaissance,
Lizotte lui appliqua des coups de poing dans le visage ainsi que des coups de
pied sur le corps et dans la région de la gorge. On le plaça ensuite sur le
plancher dans la partie arrière de la voiture, où il demeura immobile, et sans
murmurer une seule parole. Lizotte se rendit à St-Gérard prendre de l'essence.
En arrivant sur une route boisée de chaque côté, Lizotte arrêta la voiture, et
avec l'aide de Légaré et Vallières, descendit Beaumont, lui enleva une partie
de ses vêtements, et on lui enleva la somme de $38 qu'il portait sur lui. Les
vêtements furent jetés dans le fossé, et retrouvés plus tard. Quelque temps
avant d'arriver à St-Gérard, Beaumont, qui dans le fond de la voiture était
toujours demeuré immobile, rendit un soupir prolongé.

On revint ensuite dans la direction de Québec,
et à un endroit du côté Nord de la Rivière St-Charles, non loin de la ville,
""Le Remous des Hirondelles"", Lizotte arrêta de nouveau, et seul, ou
avec l'aide de Légaré et Vallières, (la preuve est contradictoire sur ce point)
et sous prétexte de ""laver"" Beaumont, le transporta vers le bord
escarpé de la rivière, et en revint sans la victime environ dix minutes plus
tard. Il recommanda aux autres ""de ne pas parler"", et que
""l'affaire finirait là"". Huit jours plus tard, on retrouva le corps
de Beaumont dans les eaux de la Rivière, près de la ville de Québec. Ce n'est
qu'un an plus tard, quand les vêtements de Beaumont furent retrouvés dans le
bois, que l'on commença l'enquête sur cette mort mystérieuse, qu'à l'origine on
avait crue accidentelle.

J'ai cru nécessaire de faire ce résumé des
faits, afin de bien faire saisir la conclusion à laquelle je suis arrivé.

Les principaux griefs d'appel de Lizotte sont
les suivants :

1) Dans son adresse aux jurés, le juge
présidant au procès aurait omis de leur signaler, comme il aurait dû le faire,
certains éléments de preuve tendant à démontrer le moment où Beaumont est mort.

[Page 414]

2) Ce n'est pas le paragraphe D de l'article 259
(Code Cr.) qui s'applique, mais bien le paragraphe B, sur lequel les jurés
n'ont pas été légalement instruits.

3) A défaut d'acquittement, seul un verdict de
""manslaughter"" pouvait être rendu par un jury correctement informé.

Le premier grief, s'il est fondé, est celui
qui à notre sens doit déterminer le sort de cet appel. En effet, si Beaumont est
mort parce qu'il aurait été jeté dans la rivière par Lizotte, ce dernier serait
indiscutablement coupable de meurtre. Au cours de sa charge aux jurés, le juge
présidant au procès, après avoir récité certains faits saillants de cette
triste aventure, semble avoir omis quelques éléments de preuve, essentiels pour
arriver à une juste conclusion. Sans doute, il n'est pas impératif que le juge
décrive en détail toutes et chacune des circonstances qui ont entouré un crime,
mais encore faut-il qu'il place devant le jury tout ce qui est révélé par les
témoignages, soit de la Couronne ou de la défense, qui peut être un moyen
sérieux de disculper l'accusé. (Le Roi v. Azoulay 4)
; (Le Roi v. Kelsey 5) ; (Vide Lord
Goddard in Dereck Clayton-Wright 6).

Avec déférence, nous ne croyons pas que ces
exigences de la loi aient été observées, et que la théorie de la défense ait
été soumise aux jurés, comme elle aurait dû l'être. Il semble incontestable que
la prépondérance de la preuve démontre que Beaumont est mort bien avant qu'il
ne soit jeté dans la Rivière St-Charles. Légaré, Vallières, Demers, témoignent
tous que Beaumont, après les coups qui lui furent portés, gisait immobile dans
le fond de la voiture et qu'il ne prononçait aucune parole. On n'entendait pas
sa respiration, sauf le long soupir qu'il rendit en arrivant à St-Gérard, et
qui fut probablemet son dernier. Aucune apparence de vie ne s'est manifestée,
lorsque le corps inerte a été replacé dans la voiture après l'assaut dont il
fut la victime, pas plus que quand on l'a sorti de nouveau pour le dévaliser,
ou pour plus tard le jeter dans la rivière. C'est bien Lizotte qui, réalisant
ce qui était arrivé à Beaumont, dit à Demers, avant de se diriger vers la
Rivière St-Charles, ""Tu vas nous aider Ti-blond, ou bien tu vas mourir toi
aussi.""

[Page 415]

La preuve médicale semble être au même effet.
Le Docteur Fontaine qui a examiné la victime, n'a pas constaté de fracture du
crâne comme résultat des coups de bouteille, mais paraît être d'opinion qu'il
est possible que la mort soit la conséquence d'une hémorragie interne, qui
aurait provoqué un étouffement. D'ailleurs, la Couronne n'a pas prétendu que Beaumont
était mort noyé. Au contraire, elle a prétendu qu'il était mort des coups qu'il
avait reçus, et que ce n'est qu'un cadavre qui a été jeté à la rivière.

Ce point de vue n'a pas été soumis aux jurés.
A sa lecture, l'ensemble de la charge ignore entièrement le témoignage du
Docteur Fontaine, et ne met pas en relief le fait de la mort probable avant que
Beaumont ne soit jeté dans la rivière. L'impression laissée aux jurés a sans
doute été que la victime est morte noyée par l'acte volontaire et prémédité
de Lizotte, et non comme résultat de la querelle qui a originé dans le taxi
sur la route de St-Gérard. Nous croyons que cette insuffisance d'instruction
aux jurés, a contribué dans une large mesure à la sévérité du verdict qui a été
prononcé.

Il ne nous paraît pas nécessaire de déterminer
si, comme les parties l'ont contradictoirement prétendu, c'est le paragraphe
(B) sur lequel les jurés n'ont pas été instruits, ou le paragraphe (D) de
l'article 259 (C. Cr.), qui doit trouver son application. Que ce soit l'une ou
l'autre de ces dispositions qui régisse le présent cas, nous croyons que le
verdict ne peut être maintenu et doit être cassé.

Nous sommes d'avis, en tenant compte des faits
particuliers de ce procès, et spécialement de la théorie sur laquelle la
Couronne a basé sa cause, que les fins de la justice seront bien servies, si
cette Cour, en vertu de l'autorité qui lui est conférée par l'article 1024(1)  du
Code Criminel , rend une ordonnance substituant un verdict de ""manslaughter""
à celui de meurtre qui a été prononcé. (Vide: Manchuk v. Le Roi 7) ; (Lizotte et Savard v. Le
Roi 8).

L'appelant, Légaré et Vallières ont été
arrêtés au mois d'août 1948, et détenus en prison. Légaré et Vallières ont été
tous deux condamnés pour ""manslaughter"" à 8 ans de pénitencier au
mois de mars 1952. Il s'ensuit que l'appelant est incarcéré depuis près de 5 ans,
et nous croyons en conséquence, étant donné les diverses circonstances de cette

[Page 416]

cause, et vu le sort qui a été réservé aux
autres qui ont participé à ce crime, qu'une sentence de 8 années de
pénitencier, à compter du présent jugement, serait juste et adéquate.

Nous sommes d'opinion de maintenir l'appel, de
casser le verdict de meurtre qui a été rendu, d'y substituer celui de ""manslaughter"",
et de condamner l'appelant à huit années de pénitencier, à compter de la date
du présent jugement.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Drift logs in
rivers—Whether mens rea ingredient of offence under s. 894  (b) of the Criminal
Code —Alleged custom or practice of paying salvage.

The appellants, acquitted by the trial judge, were convicted
by a majority in the Court of Appeal under s. 394 (b) of the Criminal
Code  for having refused to deliver up to the owners certain saw-logs which
had been found adrift in a river in British Columbia.

Held: The appeal should be allowed.and the trial
judgment restored.

Per: Taschereau, Rand and Fauteux JJ.—There was an
implied understanding between the appellants and the owners of the logs
salvaged whereby the former were entitled to assume that they would be paid for
services upon delivery of the logs and, under such circumstances, the
appellants were not within s. 394(b) of the Code.

Per: Kellock J.—Considering s. 394 (b) with
s. 990(2) of the Code, the appellants had lawfully taken possession of
the logs on the implied basis that the owners in accordance with past practice
were willing to remunerate them. Therefore no offence was disclosed.

Per: Estey and Cartwright JJ.— Mens rea is an
essential ingredient of the offence created by s. 394 (b) of the Code
and, in view of the practice between the owners of these logs and the
appellants, its existence was not established.

[Page 506]

Locke J. agreed with Robertson J.A. that there was at the time
an outstanding offer by the owners of these logs to pay the beachcombers for
the salvaged logs, that the appellants were doing what they thought they had a
right to do and that therefore there was no mens rea.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , allowing, Robertson J.A. dissenting, the appeal of
the Crown and convicting the appellants under s. 394  (b) of the Criminal
Code .

G. McDonald for the
appellants.

S. J. Remnant Q.C. for the
respondent.

A. A. Moffat Q.C. for the A.G. of Canada.

TASCHEREAU, J.—In view of the
practice that was followed for many years, I believe that the appellants
thought that they were entitled with the tacit consent of the owners, to keep
possession of the logs they had found afloat or resting on the shore. They
were, I think, left under the honest impression, as a result of previous
happenings, that they were entitled to receive forty per cent of the market
value of the logs they had recovered, or sell them after ten days, remitting
sixty per cent to the owners. I can find no elements of criminality attached to
the act done by the appellants.

I would allow the appeal, and
quash the conviction.

RAND, J.:—There is no doubt that the accused acted on the
fact or the reasonable belief in the fact that they had permission from the
owners to salvage logs on the understanding that they would be entitled to
compensation to the extent of 40 per cent of the value which could be deducted
from the sale price realized by them or paid by the owner on delivery up of the
logs. On that state of facts that no offence has been committed under sec. 394
(b) of the Code seems to me to be scarcely arguable. The word
""fraudulently"" carries through the entire section; and, regardless of
that, on the language of (b) to import an offence from such objective
acts divested of intent would be a new departure in the interpretation of
criminal legislation.

I would, therefore, allow the
appeal and restore the judgment of acquittal.

[Page 507]

KELLOCK, J.:—The appellants were
convicted under the provisions of section 394  (b) of the Criminal
Code  for, on August 20, 1951, having in their possession certain saw-logs
which had been found adrift in a river in Canada and unlawfully did refuse to
deliver up the said sawlogs to the proper owner thereof or to the person
authorized by such owner to receive the same. The appellants had for some years
followed the practice of picking up sawlogs found adrift at the mouth of the Fraser River and the adjacent waters or on the shores. Thereafter
they informed the British Columbia Forest Service, asking that department to
scale the logs so taken. In due course, this was done by an officer of the
department, which then sent a copy of the scale to the appellants and, in the
case of logs bearing a visible mark, a copy was also sent to the respective
owners. It was the practice for the appellants to wait a period of ten days
thereafter and at the end of that time to dispose of the logs, remitting sixty
per cent to the owners and retaining forty per cent for their own services.

According to the evidence, the
purchasers of such logs from the appellants would be furnished by the
department or obtain from the department the original scale showing the names
of the owners of marked logs. The evidence also shows, and counsel for the
respondent argued the case on the basis that, as found by the trial court, the
owners of the particular logs here in question had followed this practice with
the appellants for some four or five years. The majority in the court below[2]
were, however, of opinion that in such circumstances, the appellants, having in
the present instance refused to give up the particular logs to the owners on
demand, there was no defence to the charge. Section 394  (b) reads as
follows:

394—Everyone is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to three years' imprisonment who

(b) refuses to
deliver up to the proper owner thereof, or to the person in charge thereof, on
behalf of such owner or authorized by such owner to receive the same, any such
timber…

It might well be said that this
section contemplates that the owner or his agent who demands possession of the
timber has not, qua the person to whom the demand is addressed, disentitled
himself to possession. However that

[Page 508]

may be, the section is to be
considered, as counsel for the respondent concedes, with section 990(2), which
reads:

Possession by the accused…
of any such timber… shall, in all cases, throw upon him the burden of proving
that such timber… came lawfully into his possession…

In view of this provision, no
offence was disclosed in the circumstances conceded to exist in the case at bar
where the appellants, acting in accord with the practice as between them and
the owners of the logs here in question, had taken possession of the logs with
the consent of the owners on the implied basis that if they did so, the owners
were willing to remunerate them for so doing.

In these circumstances, I think
there was no ground upon which the acquittal could have been properly set
aside. I would allow the appeal and set aside the order below.

ESTEY, J.:—The appellants were
charged that on the 20th day of August, 1951, they refused to deliver up to the
owners, the Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd., saw-logs in their possession and thereby
committed an offence contrary to s. 394  (b) of the Criminal Code .
They were acquitted in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court, but in the
Court of Appeal[3] the
majority of the learned judges directed a conviction.

The appellants were engaged in
the business, recognized in British
 Columbia, of collecting logs that have
become separated, as those here in question, from their booms and are afloat or
resting on the shore.

A few days prior to August 20, 1951,
the appellants, in the course of their business, collected a number of logs,
including those here in question bearing the mark 1-Q-1, the property of the
Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd. The appellants notified the Forestry Service, whose
employees then scaled the logs and under date of September 4 the Forestry
Service notified the appellants of its charge therefor in the sum of $117.45
and added:

Upon receipt of your CERTIFIED
CHEQUE for $177.45 or cash, the original Scale and Royalty Account will be
released to you which will enable you to dispose of these logs.

This amount of $117.45 was paid
by the appellants.

[Page 509]

Either on the same date
(September 4) or prior thereto the Forestry Service notified the Vanwest
Logging Co. Ltd. of the existence of these logs in the possession of the
appellants and, as a consequence, on September 4 the latter wrote the
appellants as follows:

We have received a letter
from the Forest Service that the following logs were scaled at the Ft. Nanaimo Street, South Vancouver for your account:

2 pcs. No. 2 Fir 859 Feet Mark 1Q1

9 pcs. No. 3 Fir 3,213 Feet Mark 1Q1

Kindly forward proceeds,
from these logs after making deductions for salvage, etc.

The appellants, upon receipt of
this letter, deducted the salvage and forwarded the proceeds as requested,
thereby becoming owners of the logs.

The Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd. had
their logs insured with the B. L. Johnson, Walton Company Limited, insurance
brokers, who employed a group of men to collect the logs, afloat or on the
shore, of their insured. When one of their employees, Carson, on August 20,
found the logs here in question in the possession of the appellants the latter
refused to deliver them to Carson, as agent for the owners, unless the salvage
was settled for, which Carson was not prepared to do. He reported to his
employer, the B. L. Johnson, Walton Company Limited, and the latter obtained a
letter from the Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd. reading as follows:

The undersigned, being the
registered owner under the Forest Act of Timber Mark 1-Q-1 do hereby authorize
you or your agent nominated in writing, to demand and secure possession on
my/our behalf of any logs bearing the above mark or marks found in possession
of any unauthorized person or persons whatsoever.

And for so doing, this shall
be your sufficient warrant and authority.

Dated at Vancouver,
B.C., this 20th day of August, 1951.

The phrase ""any unauthorized
person or persons whatsoever"" in this letter is not explained. It may be
that it would include those who were in the business and in the habit of
dealing with the Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd., which would include the appellants.
This much is significant, that the record does not suggest that Carson or
another officer or agent of the B. L. Johnson, Walton Company Limited, in any
conversation with any officer or agent of the Vanwest Logging Co. Ltd.,
mentioned when obtaining 

[Page 510]

the letter that the logs were in
the possession of the appellants. However, the B. L. Johnson, Walton Company
Limited gave this letter to Carson who, with another letter from the B. L.
Johnson, Walton Company Limited to himself authorizing him, on its behalf, to
demand the logs from any unauthorized person, again interviewed the appellants
and demanded the logs. The appellants took the same position to the effect that
when the salvage was paid they would surrender the logs and Carson took
the position that they were not entitled to salvage. As a consequence of this
refusal criminal proceedings were taken against the appellants. The learned
trial judge found as follows:

I do not think there is any
criminal intent on the part of these men whatever. They were carrying on the
practice—there is always the Court of Appeal—that is why I say the custom
between Vanwest and these men existed for four or five years. Every exhibit
there is against you.

Here the practice has gone
on 29 years, according to your own witness; then all at once, they take
criminal proceedings. It sounds very much like private prosecution. I am not
going to say any more about it.

The learned trial judge's report
made under s. 1020(2)  of the Criminal Code  reads in part:

In this particular case I
not only believe the evidence of all the Crown witnesses but also the very
candid evidence of the accused Gaunt who gave evidence on behalf of himself and
his partner Watts.

I found the accused not
guilty, my reasons being:—

(a) There was nothing
fraudulent in their action.

(b) The accused came
lawfully in possession of the logs in question.

(c) A custom had been
established between the actual owners of the logs and the accused as to the
payment of salvage, both before and after the enacting of Sec. 394B of the
Canadian Criminal Code. An arrangement had been made between the owners and/or
their agent or agents as to the payment of the salvage.

(d) I doubted the
delegation of the authority from one agent to pass along the authority to
another agent.

(e) I doubted whether
the logs were picked up in a river, as set out in the indictment.

The Court of Appeal accepted the
finding of the learned trial judge, but the learned Chief Justice, with whom
Mr. Justice Smith and Mr. Justice Bird agreed, was of the opinion that
""fraud is not an element required to be proved in a prosecution under '(b)'
of Sec. 394 "" and apparently treated the word ""fraud"" as
equivalent to mens rea. Mr. Justice Robertson and Mr. Justice O'Halloran
were of the opinion that mens rea is an essential ingredient of the
offence defined in s. 394  (b).

[Page 511]

Section 394  reads:

394. Drift Timber.—Every one
is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to three years' imprisonment who,

(a) without the
consent of the owner thereof, (i) fraudulently takes, holds, keeps in his
possession, collects, conceals, receives, appropriates, purchases, sells or
causes or procures or assists to be taken possession of, collected, concealed,
received, appropriated, purchased or sold, any timber, mast, spar, saw-log,
shingle bolt or other description of lumber, boom chains, chains, lines or
shackles, which is found adrift in, or cast ashore, or lying upon or imbedded
in the bed, bottom, or on the bank or beach of any river, stream, or lake, in
Canada, or in the harbours or any of the coast waters, including the whole of
Queen Charlotte Sound, the whole of the Strait of Georgia or the Canadian
waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, of British Columbia, or (ii) wholly or
partially defaces or adds or causes or procures to be defaced or added, any
mark or number on any such timber, mast, spar, saw-log, shingle bolt, or other
description of lumber, boom chains, chains, lines or shackles, or makes or
causes or procures to be made, any false or counterfeit mark on any such
timber, mast, spar, saw-log, shingle bolt, or other description of lumber, boom
chains, chains, lines or shackles; or

(b) refuses to
deliver up to the proper owner thereof, or to the person in charge thereof, on
behalf of such owner, or authorized by such owner to receive the same, any such
timber, mast, spar, saw-log, shingle bolt, or other description of lumber, boom
chains, chains, lines or shackles.

It is a general rule that mens
rea is an essential ingredient of criminal offences. Its meaning varies in
relation to different offences, but it is generally described by Cave J. as
""some blameworthy condition of the mind,"" Chisholm v.
Doulton[4] ,
or by Chief Justice Robertson as ""at least an intention to do a wrong or
to break the law,"" Rex v. Stewart[5]
, Tremeear, 5th Ed., p. 18; Russell on Crime, 10th Ed. p. 25.

While an offence of which mens
rea is not an essential ingredient may be created by legislation, in view
of the general rule a section creating an offence ought not to be so construed
unless Parliament has, by express language or necessary implication, disclosed
such an intention. Parliament created or defined the indictable offences under
s. 394  (a) and (b) in one sentence. Although it is not necessary
to decide the point, the grammatical construction of the sentence, as well as
the history of the section, suggests that Parliament intended the section
should be construed in a manner that the word ""fraudulently"" is an
essential ingredient of each of the offences therein defined.

[Page 512]

Even if it be assumed that the
word ""fraudulently"" is not included under the offence defined in s.
394  (b), it does not follow that mens rea is not an essential
ingredient thereof.

In Bank of New South Wales v.
Piper[6]
, in the first part of the section an offence was created of which ""with a
view to defraud"" was an essential ingredient, while in the latter part the
offence created did not include these words and their Lordships of the Privy
Council found no ""ground for construing the section as if the words 'with
a view to defraud' had been inserted"" in the latter part. Their Lordships
went on to point out the distinction between a specific intent and mens rea
as essential ingredients of an offence. In the Piper case a fraudulent intent
was required in the first part, yet while that was not required in the second
part it did not follow that mens rea was not an essential ingredient.
Even if, therefore, the word ""fraudulently"" should not be construed
to apply to all the offences under s. 394 , as above suggested, it does not
follow that mens rea would not be an essential ingredient of the offence
under s. 394  (b). At p. 389 their Lordships stated:

It was strongly urged by the
respondent's counsel that in order to the constitution of a crime, whether
common law or statutory there must be mens rea on the part of the
accused, and that he may avoid conviction by shewing that such mens did
not exist. That is a proposition which their Lordships do not desire to
dispute; but the questions whether a particular intent is made an element of
the statutory crime, and when that is not the case, whether there was an
absence of mens rea in the accused, are questions entirely different and
depend upon different considerations.

In cases when the statute
requires a motive to be proved as an essential element of the crime, the
prosecution must fail if it is not proved. On the other hand, the absence of mens
rea really consists in an honest and reasonable belief entertained by the
accused of the existence of facts which, if true, would make the act charged
against him innocent… The circumstances of the present case are far from
indicating that there was no mens rea on the part of the respondent…
Then he knew that he had not the written consent of the mortgagee; and that
knowledge was sufficient to make him aware that he was offending against the
provisions of the Act, or, in other words, was sufficient to constitute what is
known in law as mens rea.

Parliament, in s. 394  (b),
defined an indictable offence in the same sentence with one in which fraud must
be found as an essential ingredient and provides the same maximum

[Page 513]

penalty of three years for each
offence. That is understandable if mens rea is an essential ingredient
under s. 394  (b), but, if one who is acting with an honest and
reasonable belief that what he is doing is right and involves no breach of the
law is guilty of the offence and liable to the same punishment, it involves a
consequence that, apart from express language, ought not to be attributed to
Parliament. As stated by Sir Richard Couch, ""absence of mens rea
really consists in an honest and reasonable belief entertained by the accused
of the existence of facts which, if true, would make the act charged against
him innocent."" Piper case, supra, at p. 389.

Moreover, in the main, statutory
offences that have been construed not to include mens rea as an
essential ingredient have been enacted to promote public safety, health or
morality. Section 394  is placed in the Criminal Code  under the general
heading ""Offences Resembling Theft"" and, therefore, directed to wrong
doing in respect of property.

Section 990(2) places the onus
upon one charged with any one of the offences under s. 394  to prove that the
sawlogs ""came lawfully into his possession."" It would, therefore,
seem that Parliament intended that if one had sawlogs lawfully in his possession
he could retain them if he had a right thereto in the nature of a lien for
services performed which the business or practice here gave to the appellants.

The evidence here does not
justify the conclusion that the business or practice followed by the appellants
existed as far back as 1892. It does, however, establish that it has existed
over a sufficiently long period to justify the conclusion that these provisions
were never directed against one who engages in the business of gathering saw-logs
with the intent and purpose of returning them to the owner upon payment of
salvage, or of purchasing them from the owner upon a basis recognized by both
owners and others in the business, and all with the assistance and co-operation
of a department of government.

With great respect to the opinion
of the learned judges who entertain a contrary view, it would appear that mens

[Page 514]

rea is an essential ingredient of the offence under s.
394  (b) and the evidence here did not establish that the appellants
possessed that essential ingredient.

The appeal should be allowed.

LOCKE, J.:—The relevant facts in
this matter are stated in the dissenting judgment of Robertson J.A.[7]
and it is unnecessary to repeat them.

Whether or not Dickenson knew at
the time he wrote to the appellants on September 4, 1951, that the logs
referred to in the scale and royalty account No. 92492 were those of which
Carson had demanded possession on August 20, that letter and the subsequent
transaction between Gaunt and his partner and the Vanwest Logging Company
Limited, whereby the former paid to the latter sixty per cent of the value of
the logs, support the view that there was at the time in question an
outstanding offer by the owners of these logs to pay to beachcombers either
forty per cent of the market value of logs of that company which had gone
adrift and been recovered qua salvage, or to sell them such logs for sixty per
cent of their market value.

I respectfully agree with the
reasons and with the conclusion of Mr. Justice Robertson and would allow this
appeal.

CARTWRIGHT, J.:—For the reasons
given by my brother Estey I agree with his conclusion that mens rea is
an essential ingredient of the offence defined in clause (b) of section
394  of the Criminal Code . The findings of fact made by the learned trial
judge, as set out in his oral reasons delivered at the conclusion of the trial
and in his report made pursuant to section 1020(2) of the Code, appear
to me to indicate not merely that mens rea on the part of the appellant
was not established but that it was expressly negatived.

I would allow the appeal and
restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.

[Page 515]

FAUTEUX, J.:—I agree that this
appeal should be allowed. In enacting sections 394  and 990  of the Criminal
Code , Parliament intended to provide a protection of the right of ownership
of things therein mentioned and assure its adequate exercise by punishing such
encroachments of the same as are described in the sections. These provisions
necessarily assume the existence of a right of ownership and are therefore
operative in the measure in which such a right or its exercise is not otherwise
affected or conditioned either by laws of a competent legislature or by the
very person vested with it. It cannot be presumed, for instance, that Parliament
intended, by enacting ss. (b) of s. 394 —i.e. by making the refusal to
deliver to the owner a crime—, to defeat a contract authorized in civil matters
under the terms of which a right to retain the logs until payment for services
rendered would be given by the party owning these logs to the party gathering
them.

In the present case, no one
suggested that the appellants have, in relation to the logs in question,
committed the offence described in paragraph (a) of s. 394 . As to the
charge actually laid against them under paragraph (b) of s. 394 , the
trial Judge found—and this finding is supported by the evidence—in an existing
custom, an implied understanding between the appellants and the owners
entitling the former, at the time when the logs would have to be delivered,
either to be paid by the latter for their services or to purchase the logs they
collected upon a basis recognized by both. The circumstances of this case do
not bring the appellants within the scope of the sub-section on which they were
charged.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA. 

Criminal Law—Habitual
Criminal—Whether an offence within meaning of the Criminal Code —Whether right
of election extends to such an allegation—Criminal Code  ss. 575B , 575C , Part X
(A).

An accused charged with breaking and entering elected for
speedy trial under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code . Thereafter the Crown
served notice under s. 575C (4)  (b) that at the trial he would ""be
charged with being a habitual criminal."" Following his conviction on the
1st charge the trial judge without giving him a further opportunity to elect,
proceeded to inquire and found him to be a habitual criminal and sentenced him
to a term of five years on the 1st charge, and directed that as a habitual
criminal he be detained in prison, as provided by s. 575B , for an indefinite
period. The accused appealed from the sentence imposed on the charge of being a
habitual criminal,

[Page 374]

on the ground that it was a charge of a criminal offence on
which he had a right of election which had not been granted him and in the
alternative, that if such a charge was not a charge of a criminal offence it so
materially affected the punishment which might be imposed that he was entitled
to notice of the habitual criminal proceedings before being called upon to elect
as to the mode of trial on the substantive offence. The appeal was dismissed by
the Court of Appeal, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting.

Held: 1. By the majority of the Court (Locke and
Cartwright JJ. expressing no opinion) that the allegation of being a habitual
criminal is not an offence within the meaning of the Criminal Code . Rex
v. Hunter [1921] 1 K.B. 555, followed.

2. (Cartwright J. dissenting): That the right of election
restricted by Part XVIII to certain indictable offences, does not extend to
such an allegation.

Per: Estey J. Part XVIII restricts the right to an
election to certain indictable offences. The addition of a charge of being a
habitual criminal, after the required notice, does not become a part of the
offence or crime charged in the indictment. There is, therefore, no right
within the meaning of the provisions of the said Part, to a further election
upon the crime as charged, when a charge of being a habitual criminal is added
to the indictment. Rex v. Robinson [1951] S.C.R. 522,
distinguished.

Per: Locke J.—Whether the charge laid under Part X(A)
is of a criminal offence or merely the first step in an enquiry as to the
accused's status or condition, as suggested in Hunter's case, no
question of right of election arises. The very terms of Part X(A) exclude the
provisions relating to election contained in Part XVIII.

Per: Fauteux J.— Rex v. Robinson has no
application. The whole matter being one of sentence, as was decided in Hunter's
case, is one beyond the field of election which is strictly related to the
trial of an indictable offence as to which the right of election is given and
has nothing to do with sentence.

Per: Cartwright J., dissenting—It is not necessary to
determine whether a charge of being a habitual criminal under Part X(A) is a charge
of a criminal offence. On the hypothesis that it is not, its addition to the
charge sheet had the effect of changing the charge upon which the accused made
his election to one different in substance, with the result that the appellant
never elected to be tried on the charge on which he was tried. Rex v. Armitage
[1939] O.R. 417, applied. No notice was conveyed to the appellant that if he
elected trial by a judge on the first charge he would at the same time be
giving up his right to have a jury determine the question whether or not he was
a habitual criminal.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia (O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) [1],
which dismissed an appeal from a conviction on a speedy trial by Grimmett J.,
County Court Judge, on a charge of being a habitual criminal.

[Page 375]

J. L. Farris, Q.C. for the
appellant. 

L. H. Jackson for the
respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—It is
submitted on behalf of the appellant that the Court of Appeal erred in failing
to quash the conviction, because the accused should have been given an
opportunity of electing as to how he wished to be tried on the charge of being
an habitual criminal.

On February 5, 1952, the
appellant was tried in County Court Judge's Criminal Court, New Westminster,
B.C., on the original charge of breaking and entering and convicted and
sentenced to five years imprisonment. Immediately thereafter the appellant was
proceeded against as an habitual criminal and witnesses were heard, whereupon
the learned trial judge found the accused to be an habitual criminal and
ordered that he be detained for an indeterminate period in prison.

The wording of the various sub-sections
of s. 575  of The Criminal Code  of Canada are copied almost verbatim from
the English Statute (Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, c. 59) whereunder
proceedings against habitual criminals have been in effect for a number of
years in England. The Court of Appeal followed the English decision in Rex
v. Hunter [2],
wherein the matter raised by the present appellant is fully discussed. In that
case the judgment of the Court was delivered by the Earl of Reading C.J. and at
p. 559 he said, inter alia:—

In my judgment the whole
question depends upon whether the charge against the appellant was a charge of
an offence or crime or whether it merely asserted a status or condition in him
which would enable the court if it were established to deal with him in a
certain manner. We are of opinion that Mr. Oliver's argument on his behalf is
sound, and that there is nothing in the Act which would justify us in saying
that the charge of being a habitual criminal is a charge of a crime or offence.

And again at p. 560:—

If one turns to s. 10, the
object of the Legislature is shown by reference to sub-s. 1—namely, to enable
the court to pass a further sentence if the accused is found to be a habitual
criminal. That seems to me to be the key to the question, and to show that the
Act intended to empower the Court, not to convict of another offence, but to
pass a further sentence. That shows that Parliament was not creating a new
offence.

[Page 376]

The majority of the Court
appealed from relied on that decision, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting.

The wording of the sections in
question (575 (a) to 575 (g)) are all indicative of their
meaning. Section 575  (b) is as follows:—

Where a person is convicted
of an indictable offence committed after the commencement of this Part and
subsequently the offender admits that he is or is found by a jury or a judge to
be a habitual criminal, and the court passes a sentence upon the said offender,
the court, if it is of the opinion that, by reason of his criminal habits and
mode of life, it is expedient for the protection of the public, may pass a
further sentence ordering that he be detained in a prison for an indeterminate
period and such detention is hereinafter referred to as preventive detention
and the person on whom such a sentence is passed shall be deemed for the
purpose of this Part to be a habitual criminal.

There can be no question that an
enactment of that kind was within the competency of the Canadian Parliament,
since the criminal law in its widest sense is reserved for its exclusive
authority (A.G. for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Ry. [3]; Proprietary
Articles Trade Association v. A.G. for Canada
[4].

Adopting the language of the Earl
of Reading, the sections of The Criminal Code  referred to were ""not
creating a new offence"", but just enabling the court to pass a further
sentence if the accused was found to be a habitual criminal.

The appeal should be dismissed.

ESTEY, J.:—The appellant contends
that an accused who, following his election, has been tried and found guilty of
an indictable offence before a judge presiding under Part XVIII (Speedy Trials
of Indictable Offences) of The Criminal Code  has the right, before being
charged as a habitual criminal under Part X(A), to make an election as to
whether he will be tried upon that charge before a judge or a judge with a
jury.

The appellant and two others were
committed for trial upon a charge that they jointly did break, enter and steal
(hereinafter referred to as the crime). They elected for a speedy trial before
a judge under Part XVIII. Thereafter on December 19, 1951, the Crown served a notice under s. 575C(4) (b) that at the
trial the appellant would ""be charged with being a habitual
criminal."" The learned

[Page 377]

trial judge, on February 5, 1952,
found all three guilty of the crime and forthwith, without giving appellant a
further opportunity to elect, proceeded to inquire and find him to be a
habitual criminal. He accordingly directed that the appellant be detained in
prison for an indeterminate period as provided under s. 575B .

If being a habitual criminal is
an indictable offence it would seem that the provisions of s. 834 would be
applicable and, though the charge of an offence other than that upon which the
accused had been committed may be included in the indictment under the proviso
of that section (834), the prisoner should not be tried thereon without his
consent or, in other words, without an election to be so tried.

The question, therefore, arises
is being a habitual criminal an offence? The provisions with respect to
habitual criminals were first enacted and made a part of our Criminal Code  in
1947. Parliament then enacted, as part X(A) of the Criminal Code , provisions
respecting habitual criminals and in doing so adopted the principle underlying
and much of the language of Part II of the English Prevention of Crime Act,
1908 (8 Edw. VII, c. 59). Section 575B  reads as follows:

575B. Where a person is
convicted of an indictable offence committed after the commencement of this
Part and subsequently the offender admits that he is or is found by a jury or a
judge to be a habitual criminal, and the court passes a sentence upon the said
offender, the court, if it is of the opinion that, by reason of his criminal
habits and mode of life, it is expedient for the protection of the public, may
pass a further sentence ordering that he be detained in a prison for an
indeterminate period and such detention is hereinafter referred to as
preventive detention and the person on whom such a sentence is passed shall be
deemed for the purpose of this Part to be a habitual criminal.

Section 575C  reads as follows:

575C. (1) A person shall not
be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury as the case may be,
finds on evidence,

(a) that since
attaining the age of eighteen years he has at least three times previously to
the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an
indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years'
imprisonment, whether any such previous conviction was before or after the
commencement of this Part, and that he is leading persistently a criminal life;
or

(b) that he has on a
previous conviction been found to be a habitual criminal and sentenced to
preventive detention.

(2) In any indictment under
this section it shall be sufficient, after charging the crime, to state that
the offender is a habitual criminal.

[Page 378]

Parliament does not in these
which may be referred to as the substantive sections of Part X(A) describe
being a habitual criminal as an offence. This in itself is most significant
and, with respect, I think the other language used supports the view that
Parliament did not intend being a habitual criminal should be an offence.

It will be observed that under s.
575B  one who is found to be a habitual criminal will be detained as such only
when the court ""is of the opinion that, by reason of his criminal habits
and mode of life, it is expedient for the protection of the public"" that
he should be detained. If Parliament had intended that being a habitual
criminal was an offence it would, in all probability, have treated it the same
as all other offences and directed that sentence be passed and detention ordered
or suspended as the court might determine upon the offence being established.

Then again under s. 575C  an
accused must first be found guilty of an indictable offence. If, then, he
admits, or evidence is adduced, that he has been three times previously
convicted of indictable offences for which a penalty of at least five years
might have been imposed and he is ""leading persistently a criminal
life,"" he may be found to be a habitual criminal and a further sentence
may then be passed if, as provided in s. 575B , the court is of the opinion that
for the protection of the public an indeterminate period of preventive
detention should be directed. It is not penal servitude that Parliament has in
mind, but rather, as expressed, preventive detention. Penal servitude has for
its object both punishment and example. Punishment, so far as the habitual
criminal is concerned, has failed. Parliament now provides for his preventive
detention.

The significance of the phrase
""preventive detention,"" as used in s. 575B , is further emphasized by
s. 575G (2) under which he may be confined in a prison or that part of a prison
set apart for the purpose. The intent and purpose of Parliament in passing Part
X(A) was to protect the public by placing in preventive detention one who was
found to be a habitual criminal and, while so detained, that he be subject
""to such disciplinary and reformative treatment as may be prescribed by
prison regulations""

[Page 379]

(575G(3)). Parliament, during the
period of his detention, places upon the Minister of Justice the
responsibility, once at least in every three years, to review his condition,
history and circumstances with a view to determining whether he should be
placed out on licence and, if so, in what conditions (575H).

It was necessary that Parliament
should provide a procedure whereby a person may be found a habitual criminal
and it was but to be expected that in the circumstances it would be
substantially the same as that in respect of indictable offences. It directs
that one accused of being a habitual criminal shall be tried on a charge
(575C(4)). The indictment shall first set forth the crime and it will be
sufficient if there be added thereto a statement that the offender is a
habitual criminal (575C(2)). He will first be ""arraigned only on so much
of the indictment as charges the crime"" (575C(3)). If he be found not
guilty of the crime that is an end to the proceeding. If he be found guilty of
the crime then the court will direct its attention to determining whether he is
a habitual criminal. This finding shall be upon evidence (575C(1)). If he be
convicted of being a habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive detention he
may appeal. If being a habitual criminal was an indictable offence the
following words of s. 575E ""the provisions of this Act relating to an
appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence shall be applicable
thereto"" would be unnecessary. It is true that throughout Part X(A) the
words ""charge,"" ""arraignment,"" ""sentence"" and ""conviction""
are used, but it will be noted that these are all in relation to the procedure
and are not, therefore, indicative of a conclusion leading to the designation
of being a habitual criminal as an offence.

Counsel for the appellant seeks
to draw some analogy between the position of a habitual criminal and one
charged with vagrancy. Vagrancy is described as an offence and is in all
respects treated as other offences. There does, however, appear to be some
analogy between the treatment in the court of a habitual criminal and one who,
charged with an offence, has been found to be insane either at the time the
offence was committed or at the time of his trial. In both cases the provisions
are to the effect that such person is not permitted at large, but is detained
in a mental

[Page 380]

hospital or other institution to
await the pleasure of the Lieutenant-Governor. It would be contrary to public
interest to permit such a person to be at large until at least that is deemed
safe by competent authority. In like manner it is deemed unsafe, from the point
of view of the public, that one who is a habitual criminal should be at large
and, therefore, he should be detained subject to the direction of the Minister
of Justice.

In Rex v. Hunter[5],
a decision under the English statute, it was held that being a habitual
criminal is not an offence. Counsel for the appellant submitted that decision
was either distinguishable or ought not to be applied to the provisions of Part
X(A) because of the difference in our legislation. He points out that in England the
inquiry can only be before a jury and, therefore, no election ever takes place.
That, however, is a matter of procedure or mode of trial and does not affect
the substantive provisions. Parliament, in defining the term ""judge""
in Part X(A), expressly contemplated that the inquiry as to whether a person is
a habitual criminal would be made both by a judge presiding under Part XVIII
and any judge having criminal jurisdiction in the province.

Counsel also emphasized the
difference in language between s. 11 of the English Act and the corresponding
s. 575E of the Canadian Act dealing with the matter of an appeal. In the former
the language is ""a person sentenced to preventive detention may…""
while in the Canadian Act it reads ""a person convicted and sentenced to
preventive detention may…"" The word ""convicted"" in s. 575E does
not add anything and is, as already stated, in relation to procedure and in any
event it does not override the general intention of Parliament.

Section 13 of the English Act and
s. 575G of the Canadian Act are different in this sense that under the English
Act the sentence of preventive detention takes effect immediately on the
termination of the sentence of penal servitude, while under the Canadian Act it
takes effect immediately on the conviction of a person on a charge that he is a
habitual criminal. Here again this does not assist in determining whether being
a habitual criminal is an offence within the meaning of the Criminal Code .

[Page 381]

Counsel for the Crown adopts the
language of Mr. Justice O'Halloran that even if being a habitual criminal is
not an offence ""nevertheless Parliament has mandatorily stipulated it
shall be dealt with by the courts in the same manner (with one or two
exceptions) as if it were an indictable offence."" The learned judge,
therefore, concludes that ""Whether being a habitual criminal is a criminal
offence or not the right to elect for trial still remains an essential
statutory requirement.""

It must be conceded that, as
already stated, the words ""charge,"" ""arraignment,""
""sentence"" and ""conviction"" appear throughout the part and
under s. 575E, if an appeal is taken, the procedure therein will be that
applicable to an indictable offence. These are all relative to procedure and as
such do not affect or indicate the substantive nature of being a habitual
criminal as an offence. In fact, as already pointed out, the provision relative
to an appeal would be unnecessry if it were an indictable offence.

What is more significant is that
even in the indictment it is sufficient ""to state that the offender is a
habitual criminal"" (575C(2)) and this statement can be added only after
""not less than seven days' notice"" (575C(4) (b)). Parliament, in the
same Part X(A), in s. 575A, provides that the word ""judge"" means a
judge acting under Part XVIII of this Act and any judge having criminal
jurisdiction in the province. It is, therefore, clear that Parliament had in
mind an election and the procedure in reference thereto and it must follow
that, in providing for seven days' notice, had it intended being a habitual
criminal was an additional offence, it would, not having so described it, have
directed that s. 834 would apply.

Moreover, ss. 825, 826 and 834
make it clear that Parliament intended the provisions for an election should only
apply in certain indictable offences. Being a habitual criminal is not an
offence. A charge that an accused is a habitual criminal is added to an
indictment for an offence. Though Parliament in this sense contemplated that it
should be a part of the indictment, it does not thereby become a part of the
offence charged in the indictment. This is made clear by the provisions which
require that the accused shall first be arraigned and tried for the offence.
Then only if he be guilty of that offence will the court

[Page 382]

direct its attention to the issue
as to his being a habitual criminal and, if so, should there be directed an
indeteminate period of preventive detention. Throughout the proceeding the
offence or crime charged is treated in every respect, even as to punishment, as
separate and distinct from being a habitual criminal. With great respect to
those who entertain a contrary opinion, Part XVIII restricts the right to an
election to certain indictable offences. The addition of a charge of being a habitual
criminal, after the required notice, does not become a part of the offence or
crime charged in the indictment. There is, therefore, no right, within the
meaning of the provisions of Part XVIII, to a further election upon the crime
as charged, when a charge of being a habitual criminal is added to the
indictment.

Counsel for the appellant
referred particularly to the word ""offence"" as used in two of the
reasons for judgment in Rex v. Robinson[6].
In that case this Court had to construe the words ""at least"" where
they appear in s. 575C (1) (a) and, therefore, quite a different issue
from that here to be considered, and the word there used must be read and
construed in relation to that issue. When so read it does not assist counsel
for the appellant in his contention.

Section 575B of our Act is based
upon and adopts much of the language of s. 10(1) of the English Act, in respect
of which the Earl of Reading C.J., in Rex v. Hunter, supra,
stated:

If one turns to s. 10, the
object of the Legislature is shown by reference to sub-s. 1—namely, to enable
the Court to pass a further sentence if the accused is found to be a habitual
criminal. That seems to me to be the key to the question, and to show that the
Act intended to empower the Court, not to convict of another offence, but to
pass a further sentence. That shows that Parliament was not creating a new
offence.

These are the substantive
sections and it would seem that the learned Earl has appropriately described
the intent and purpose of the Parliament both of Great Britain and Canada.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 383]

LOCKE J.:—The appellant Brusch
was arrested on February 26, 1951, with two persons by name Paton and Abbott, on a
charge of having broken and entered certain store premises in Haney, B.C. on
that date, and on this charge the accused persons were committed for trial by a
magistrate. On March 19, 1951, the appellant appeared before His Honour Judge
Sullivan in the County Court Judges' Criminal Court for the County of Westminster and elected to be tried by a judge, without the
intervention of a jury, on such charge. While the record is silent on the
point, apparently Paton and Abbott also elected to be so tried.

On December 19, 1951, something
more than a month before the date fixed for the trial of these three persons by
a judge of the County Court of New Westminster, the Crown caused to be served a
notice on the present appellant, informing him that at the trial then fixed for
January 23, 1952, and on any adjournment thereof he would, if convicted on the
said charge,

""be charged with being
a habitual criminal and be tried upon such charge""

on the grounds that on three
previous occasions since attaining the age of eighteen years he had been
convicted of criminal offences on each of which he was liable to be sentenced
to at least five years' imprisonment, and further:

that since the year 1940 you
have been leading a persistently criminal life in that you have been an
associate of criminals, prostitutes, drug addicts and have had no regular employment
or occupation.

On the charge of breaking and
entering, the appellant, together with Paton and Abbott, was tried before His
Honour Judge Grimmett in the County Court Judges' Criminal Court at New
Westminster on February 7, 1952 and was found guilty.

Upon the charge sheet, following
that portion which charged the three accused persons of the offence of breaking
and entering, there appeared the following:

Regina v. Lloyd Brusch. In that the said Lloyd
Brusch having been convicted of the offence mentioned of breaking, entering and
theft at Haney in the County of Westminster and Province of British Columbia, on the 26th day of February, A.D. 1951, is a
habitual criminal.

R. G. KELL,

Clerk of the Peace

[Page 384]

The transcript of the proceeding
shows that at the conclusion of the trial on the charge of breaking and
entering the further charge was read by the Registrar to the accused, who was
represented by counsel, that he pleaded not guilty and that the trial proceeded
forthwith. At its conclusion the learned County Court Judge reserved his
judgment. On February 13, 1952 he found the appellant guilty on what was
referred to as ""the habitual criminal charge."" On the charge of
breaking and entering, he sentenced the appellant to a term of five years and,
finding him to be a habitual criminal, further directed that he be detained for
an indefinite period in prison.

The appellant moved before the
Court of Appeal for leave to appeal from his conviction and on the same date
gave notice of his intention to appeal and both applications were dismissed by
the Court of Appeal, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting, and it is from this judgment
that the present appeal is taken.

Section 575B  of the Criminal
Code  provides that where a person is convicted of an indictable offence committed
after the commencement of Part X(A) and subsequently:—

the offender admits that he is or is found by a jury or a
judge to be a habitual criminal, and the court passes a sentence upon the said
offender, the court, if it is of the opinion that, by reason of his criminal
habits and mode of life, it is expedient for the protection of the public, may
pass a further sentence ordering that he be detained in a prison for an
indeterminate period… and the person on whom such a sentence is passed shall be
deemed for the purpose of this Part to be a habitual criminal.

Section 575C  provides that a
person shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury,
as the case may be, finds on evidence that since attaining the age of eighteen
years he has at least three times previously to the conviction of the crime
charged in the indictment, been convicted of an indictable offence for which he
was liable to at least five years' imprisonment, and that he is leading
persistently a criminal life, or that he has on a previous conviction been
found to be a habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive detention. The
language of s-s. 3 of this section is of importance in determining the present
matter. It reads:—

In the proceedings on the
indictment the offender shall in the first instance be arraigned only on so
much of the indictment as charges the crime, and if on arraignment he pleads
guilty or is found guilty by the

[Page 385]

judge or jury, as the case
may be, unless he thereafter pleads guilty to being a habitual criminal, the
judge or jury shall be charged to enquiry whether or not he is a habitual
criminal and in that case it shall not be necessary to swear the jury again.

Of the three grounds upon which
Mr. Justice O'Halloran dissented, two only were argued before us, these being
that the charge of being a habitual criminal being a charge of a criminal
offence the accused had a right of election, which was not granted to him, and,
alternatively, if such a charge was not a charge of a criminal offence, it so
materially affects the punishment that might be imposed that the accused was
entitled to notice of the habitual criminal proceedings before being called
upon to decide as to the mode of trial on the substantive offence.

The sections of the Criminal
Code  dealing with habitual criminals were introduced into the statute in
1947 and form Part X(A) of the Code. While not identical in terms, sections
575B  and 575C  follow very closely the language of s. 10 of The Prevention of
Crime Act, 1908 (Imp.).

Since under the English statute
the question as to whether an accused person is a habitual criminal must be
determined by the jury which tries him upon what may be called the substantive
offence, no question can arise there as to a right of election.

The decision of the Court of
Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Hunter[7],
however, deals with the question as to the nature of the proceedings. The Earl
of Reading C.J. there said that the charge under s. 10 of being a habitual
criminal was not a charge of an offence or crime, but rather, merely the first
step in ascertaining ""a status or condition in him"" which would
enable the Court, if it were established, to deal with him in a certain manner.
This question was considered by the Court of Appeal in British Columbia in R.
v. Robinson[8],
in proceedings under Part X(A) and Robertson J.A., who delivered the judgment
of the Court, followed what had been said by the Earl of Reading in Hunter's
case on the question as to whether the charge of being a habitual criminal was
of a substantive offence and said that:—

The question was not one of
guilt but whether under the circumstances a further sentence should be imposed.

[Page 386]

It may, however, be noted that
the exact point to be decided in Robinson's case was as to whether the
trial judge who presided at the hearing had the right to take judicial notice
of the conviction of the prisoner for an offence against the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, which was the substantive offence charged
and of which he had pleaded guilty, and to tell the jury that was empanelled to
hear the habitual criminal charge that he had been so convicted. In the present
appeal, the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia, in delivering the
judgment of the majority of the Court, expressed the view that the sections
related to sentence only and that the Court's decision in Robinson's case
should be followed.

There is much to be said for the
contrary view, in my opinion. Sub-s. 4 of s. 575C  refers to the statement on
the indictment that the offender is a habitual criminal as a charge upon which
no person shall be tried, unless the Attorney-General of the Province consents
and not less than seven days' notice has been given to the offender specifying
the grounds upon which it is intended to found the charge. Sub-s. (a)
provides that a person shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless the
judge or jury, as the case may be, finds on evidence that, in addition to
having been three times previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years,
convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five
years' imprisonment, he is leading persistently a criminal life. This was the
charge that the learned County Court Judge was required to consider in the
present matter. Upon evidence which he considered to be sufficient, he found
Brusch to be a habitual criminal and so, if he considered it to be expedient
for the protection of the public, liable to be detained in prison for an
indeterminate period. O'Halloran J.A. points out in his dissenting judgment that
s. 238  of The Criminal Code  defines a course of conduct rendering a
person liable to conviction and sentence for the offence of vagrancy. Part X(A)
defines the course of conduct which renders a person liable to conviction as a
habitual criminal. If one is properly described as a criminal offence, why not
the other?

[Page 387]

I have, however, come to the
conclusion that whether the charge laid under Part X(A) is of a criminal
offence or merely the first step in an enquiry as to the accused person's status
or condition, as suggested in Hunter's case, no question of a right of
election arises and that this appeal should fail.

In my opinion, Part X(A) defines
in its entirety the procedure to be followed in disposing of charges of this
nature. Under s. 575(3) the offender is first arraigned on so much of the
indictment as charges the crime, in this case that of breaking and entering. If
he is tried on that offence by a judge alone, as in the present case, it is the
judge who, having found the accused guilty and passed sentence upon him, is
""charged to enquire"" whether or not he was a habitual criminal. Had
he been tried on the offence of breaking and entering by a jury and found
guilty, that jury would have been charged with the duty of determining the
habitual criminal charge. In the present case, since Part X(A) named the
tribunal which was to hear and determine the habitual criminal charge, there
was no option to offer the prisoner as to the manner in which he would be
tried. The very terms of Part X(A) exclude, in my opinion, the provisions
relating to election contained in Part XVIII of the Code.

It has been said during the
argument of the present matter that it is a hardship upon an accused person to
be deprived of the right to elect the tribunal before which a charge of this
grave nature is to be heard, on which he may be found liable to be imprisoned
for life. That, however, is a matter for Parliament and not for the courts. The
question, moreover, as to whether this works a hardship upon such an accused person
is debatable. At the time the present appellant elected to take a speedy trial
on the charge of breaking and entering, he must be held to have been aware that
since he had been convicted three times since he was eighteen years of age of
offences of the character described in Part X(A) and had been leading
persistently a criminal life, he might be charged under the provisions of that
Part with being a habitual criminal and to have considered this in electing for
a speedy trial.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 388]

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This
is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
pronounced on December 19, 1952, whereby according to the formal order of that
Court, ""the appeal… of the above-named Appellant from the finding of His
Honour Judge J. K. Grimmett, a judge of the County Court Judge's Criminal Court
for the County of Westminster, holden at New Westminster, B.C., in the said
County of Westminster, on the 13th day of February, A.D. 1952, that he, the
said Lloyd Brusch, is an habitual criminal"" was dismissed.

The appeal is based, pursuant to
section 1023(1)  of The Criminal Code , on the following questions of law,
upon which O'Halloran J.A. dissented:—

(1) the charge of being an
habitual criminal is a charge of a criminal offence on which the accused has a
right of election which was not granted to the Appellant herein;

(2) alternatively the charge
of being an habitual criminal, if it is not a charge of a criminal offence, so
materially affects the punishment that may be imposed that the accused is
entitled to notice of the habitual criminal proceedings before being called
upon to elect as to the mode of trial on the substantive offence;

(3) in the further
alternative if the charge of being an habitual criminal is not a charge of a
criminal offence but a matter in respect of status, then it is legislation in
respect to a non-criminal matter and the Parliament of Canada has no
jurisdiction to legislate with respect thereto.

No argument was addressed to us
in regard to the third ground of dissent, and I therefore propose to deal only
with the first two questions above set out.

The facts are as follows. The
appellant was arrested on February 26, 1951 and was charged jointly with two
others with breaking and entering a store with intent to steal. The three were
committed for trial. On March 19, 1951, the three accused elected a speedy trial pursuant
to the provisions of Part XVIII of the Criminal Code  and the trial was
set for the 28th of May. On that date and on several subsequent dates the three
accused appeared and the trial was further adjourned and finally commenced on
February 5, 1952.

No objection is taken to the form
of the statement in writing, prepared pursuant to section 827(3) of the Code,
insofar as it relates to the charge of breaking and entering.

[Page 389]

This statement is signed ""R.
G. Kell"", Clerk of the Peace. Below this signature appears the following:—

Regina v.
Lloyd Brusch

For that the said Lloyd
Brusch, having been convicted of the above mentioned offence of breaking,
entering and theft at Haney in the County of Westminster and Province of
British Columbia, on the 26th day of February A.D. 1951, is a habitual
criminal.

R. G. KELL, 

Clerk of the Peace

Code Sec. 575 C (2)

The record is silent as to when
the last mentioned addition was placed on the charge sheet but it is clear that
it was not mentioned or in any way brought to the notice of the accused or his
counsel at the time he elected to be tried before a judge without the
intervention of a jury. On December 19,
 1951 an undated notice addressed to the
appellant was served upon him, stating that if convicted on the breaking and
entering charge he would ""be charged with being an habitual criminal and
be tried upon such charge on the following grounds, namely…"". The notice
sufficiently sets out the grounds upon which it was intended to found the
charge.

The trial on the charge of
breaking and entering was held on the 5th and 7th days of February 1952. At the
conclusion of the trial the appellant and the other two accused were found
guilty and immediately thereafter counsel for the Crown asked the Clerk of the
Court to read the charge against the appellant of being a habitual criminal.
The Clerk of the Court read the charge. The appellant, who was represented by
counsel, was called upon to plead. He pleaded ""not guilty"" and the
hearing proceeded. At the conclusion of the hearing the learned trial judge
reserved his judgment until February 13 to which date he remanded the accused.
On February 13 he delivered judgment orally, saying in part:—""On the
habitual criminal trial charge I have come to the conclusion that you are
guilty as charged… therefore I sentence you to be detained for an indeterminate
period in prison."" On the charge of breaking and entering the learned
trial judge sentenced the appellant to five years imprisonment. No appeal was
taken from the last mentioned conviction and sentence.

[Page 390]

From the above recital of facts
it is clear that the appellant was given no opportunity of electing as to how
the question whether he was a habitual criminal should be determined, that is
to say, whether it should be by a judge under Part XVIII of The Criminal
Code  or by a jury. The contention of counsel for the respondent is that in
any case in which an accused has been charged with an indictable offence
falling with section 825(1) of the Code and has properly elected to be tried on
such charge by a judge under Part XVIII, it is open to the prosecuting officer
to make an addition to the charge sheet stating, pursuant to section 575C(2) ,
that the accused is a habitual criminal, and that, without any further election
by the accused, the judge trying the indictable offence has jurisdiction to try
the further question whether or not the accused is a habitual criminal.

The Crown relies on the case of Rex
v. Hunter[9], a
decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. In that case the appellant ""was
indicted at the London Sessions for office breaking and larceny and also for
being a habitual criminal."" The jury convicted him on the charge of office
breaking and larceny. Before the charge of being a habitual criminal, which the
appellant denied, was gone into he asked for an adjournment to enable him to
call a witness who was not present. After discussion the Deputy Chairman
adjourned the trial of the question whether the accused was a habitual criminal
to the following sessions and in the meanwhile sentenced the accused to three
years penal servitude on the charge of office breaking. The sole ground of
appeal appears to have been that on a proper interpretation of The
Prevention of Crime Act, 1908 8 Edw. VII, c. 59, which is in its wording
similar to, although by no means identical with, Part X(A) of the Criminal
Code , where in addition to a substantive charge a charge is made that the
accused is a habitual criminal the last mentioned charge must be tried by the
same jury that tries the substantive charge. 

That point had already been dealt
with by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Jennings [10]and
in delivering the judgment of the Court in Rex v. Hunter (supra)
the Earl of Reading C.J. said, in part:—""The only ques-

[Page 391]

tion remaining is whether
Parliament has altered the law since the decision in Rex v. Jennings."" I do not read Rex v. Jennings as necessarily deciding
that the charge of being a habitual criminal is not a charge of a crime or
offence but there is no doubt that in Rex v. Hunter the Court did so decide,
and, while it was not necessary to the decision, a court of thirteen judges,
presided over by Hewart L.C.J. in Rex v. Norman[11],
appears to approve the decision in Hunter's case. It would seem, therefore,
that it must be taken to be established in England that the charge of being a
habitual criminal is not a charge of an offence or crime but is merely an
assertion of the existence of a status or condition in the accused which would
enable the Court, if it were established, to deal with him in a certain manner.

I am much impressed by the
reasons given by O'Halloran J.A. in his dissenting judgment in the case at bar
for reaching a result on the construction of Part X(A) of the Code different
from that which was reached on the construction of the Act under consideration
in the Hunter case but I do not think it is necessary, in this appeal,
to finally determine whether a charge of being a habitual criminal under Part
X(A) of the Code is a charge of a crime or of an offence. If it is, as
O'Halloran J.A. considers it to be, then clearly the learned trial judge had no
jurisdiction to deal with the charge as the appellant had not elected to be
tried by him. If, however, the alternative view is accepted, i.e. that the
statement added to the indictment or charge sheet, pursuant to s. 575C(2), is
not a charge of an offence, then I respectfully agree with O'Halloran J.A. that
an election by the appellant was nonetheless an essential condition precedent
to the judge acquiring jurisdiction to determine, without the intervention of a
jury, the question, whether the accused was or was not a habitual criminal.

On the hypothesis that the
statement added to the charge sheet stating the appellant to be a habitual
criminal was not the charge of an offence, in my opinion that addition had the
effect of changing the charge upon which the appellant had made his election to
one different in substance, with the result that the appellant never elected to
be tried by the learned judge on the charge on which he

[Page 392]

was tried. In Rex v. Armitage
[12],
the circumstances dealt with were different from those in the case at bar but I
think that case rightly decides that a change in an indictment which makes it
possible to impose a longer term of imprisonment in the event of conviction
cannot be regarded as an amendment in matter of form only. When, pursuant to s.
827 of the Code, the judge stated to the appellant that he was charged
with an offence, he described only the offence of breaking and entering and no
notice of any sort was conveyed to the appellant that if he elected trial by a
judge on that charge he would at the same time be giving up his right to have a
jury determine the question whether or not he was a habitual criminal.

It is obvious that an accused
might be moved to electtrial by a judge on a substantive charge by
considerations different from those which would weigh with him in deciding what
tribunal should decide whether he was a habitual criminal. He might know that
he was guilty of the substantive charge but be convinced, in his own mind, that
he was not a habitual criminal. He might be willing to be tried without a jury
for an offence as to which he knew the maximum penalty, but desire a jury to
pass upon a question the adverse determination of which could result in his
being deprived of his liberty for the rest of his life.

I can find no provision in the Code
giving jurisdiction to a judge to determine without the intervention of a
jury whether an accused is a habitual criminal, without the accused's consent,
given after being informed that the question, or one of the questions, to be
determined is whether he is a habitual criminal.

I can derive little assistance
from the sections of the Code dealing with the method of specifying in
an indictment or charge sheet that an accused who is charged with a substantive
offence has been previously convicted. The only questions in such a case, in
regard to the previous conviction, are those of historical fact and identity.
The question whether or not a person is a habitual criminal involves an inquiry
going much further afield, the nature of which is fully discussed in the
judgment of the Lord Chief Justice in Rex v. Norman
(supra).

[Page 393]

In my view the charge or
statement that a person is a habitual criminal must be regarded as either (i) a
substantive charge of an offence, or (ii) the allegation of the existence of a
condition in a person accused of an indictable offence (conveniently referred
to as a substantive offence) by reason of which such person if found guilty of
the substantive offence may suffer detention for an indeterminate period in
addition to any punishment imposed for the substantive offence, and therefore a
substantial ingredient of the indictment charging the substantive offence. If
the former is the right view, the question raised in this appeal presents no
difficulty; but if the latter view is preferred then for the reasons given
above I am of opinion that there was no proper election by the accused to be
tried under Part XVIII.

If the construction of the
relevant sections of the Code were difficult or doubtful the Court
should adopt that construction which does not deprive an accused of the right
to have tried by a jury a question which may involve his losing his liberty for
the rest of his life. The power of Parliament to take away the right to trial
by jury is not questioned but the intention to do so should not lightly be
assumed.

It remains to consider the
question, raised during the argument before us that the appellant can not now
be heard to allege lack of jurisdiction because he pleaded to the charge before
the learned trial judge without objection and did not raise the question of
jurisdiction at the trial. On this point reference was made to Sayers v.
The King [13]. In my
opinion that case is distinguishable from the case at bar. In Sayers' case
the appellants were convicted after trial by a jury. It was held that their
right to elect trial and to be tried without a jury under Part XVIII of the
Code, if it existed, was a privilege which could be waived and which was waived
by pleading, without objection, to the arraignment before the jury. In the case
at bar, in my respectful view, the consent of the accused obtained pursuant to
the provisions of s. 827 of the Code was a condition precedent to the
existence of jurisdiction in the learned trial judge and such consent was not
obtained.

[Page 394]

For the above reasons I would
allow the appeal and quash the finding that the appellant is a habitual
criminal and the sentence passed upon that finding.

FAUTEUX J.:—This is an appeal
under s. 1023  of the Criminal Code . Of the three grounds of law, upon which
there was a dissent, only the first two have to be considered, for the third
one—related to the constitutionality of Part XA—has been abandoned by the
appellant and the Attorney General for Canada was not represented at the
hearing.

In brief, the whole matter raises
a question of procedure but, as will be seen, one of substance, i.e. one of
jurisdiction.

Originally charged with the
offence of ""breaking and entering a store with intent to steal,"" the
appellant, after being committed to trial for this offence, elected to be tried
on the same, by a judge alone, under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code . A
plea of not guilty was entered and several adjournments of the case ensued.
Some two months before trial, i.e. on the 19th of December 1951, the appellant
received notice that the Crown intended to proceed with a charge of being a
habitual criminal and at some time before the trial, an addition, implementing
this intention, was made to the formal statement in writing provided under s.
827  s-s. 3 . Without a new election nor any objection being made in the matter,
the trial proceeded; the appellant was found guilty of the substantive offence
as to which he had elected; immediately thereafter, the secondary issue was
inquired into and he was found to be a habitual criminal and sentenced as such.

As formulated, the first ground
of law is:—

The charge of being a
habitual criminal is a charge of a criminal offence on which the accused has a
right of election which was not granted to the appellant.

This point rests on two legal
assumptions:—(a) That to be a habitual criminal is a criminal offence; (b)
That this offence is indictable and one for the trial of which a right to elect
for a speedy trial is given.

Dealing with (a):—This
point never came before this Court. Our decision in Rex v. Robinson[14],
relied on by counsel for the appellant, has no application. It is true

[Page 395]

that some of the members of the
Court, incidentally, said that by the enactment of Part X(A), Parliament
created a new offence. But besides the fact that such a dictum was not
expressed by a majority of the Court, it was foreign to the issue and its
determination. The question, however, came squarely before the English Criminal
Court of Appeal in Hunter [15]
where, having to determine the object of the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908—from
which Part X(A) of the Criminal Code  is inspired—Reading L.C.J.,
rendering the judgment for the Court, said at page 74:—

…that to be a habitual
criminal within the meaning of the statute is not a substantive offence, but is
a state of circumstances affecting the prisoner which enables the court to pass
a further or additional sentence to that which has been already imposed; …

At page 73, the Lord Chief
Justice says:— 

Turning to s. 10 we think
that the object of the legislature is clearly shown by reference to sub-s. (1).
It empowers the Court to pass a further sentence if the prisoner is found to be
a habitual criminal. That seems really the key of the question so much
discussed today, and indicates that the Act was not intended to enable the
Court to convict of another offence, but was intended to enable the Court, when
the prisoner has been convicted of the substantive offence for which he is
indicted and has been sentenced to at least three years' penal servitude, to
pass ""a further sentence, ordering that on the determination of the
sentence of penal servitude,"" he be detained for a further period.

It is plain, looking at the
language of this statute, that the intention of Parliament was, that if the man
is found to be a habitual criminal, then, in addition to the sentence of three
years' penal servitude for the substantive offence, he may be sentenced to
preventive detention.

The object of our own legislation
is manifested in the provisions of s. 575 (b) which, and so far as the
object of Part X(A) is concerned, are couched in terms similar to those of s.
10 s-s. 1 of the English Act. If anything, I think that the provisions of the
former are more apt than those of the latter to support, with respect to Part
X(A), a conclusion similar to the one reached by the English Criminal Court of
Appeal for, at the end of s. 10, s-s. 1, it is said:—

…and a person on whom
such a sentence is passed shall, whilst undergoing both the sentence of
penal servitude and the sentence of preventive detention, be deemed for
the purposes of the Forfeiture Act, 1870, and for all other purposes, to
be a person convicted of felony.

[Page 396]

The corresponding wording of s.
575 (b) is:—

…and the person on
whom such a sentence is passed shall be deemed for the purpose of this
Part to be a habitual criminal.

Nowhere in enacting Part X(A) did
Parliament use the word ""offence"" to characterize the conditions
which must be met before one may be deemed to be a habitual criminal. Part X(A)
does not define a habitual criminal but it does give in s. 575 (b) and
s. 575 (c), the circumstances which must co-exist before a person may be
deemed for the purpose of this new part, to be a habitual criminal. These
circumstances are:—

1. A fresh, precedent and
contemporaneous conviction of an indictable offence after the commencement of
the part;

2. An admission of the
convicted offender or a finding by a jury or a Judge that he is a habitual
criminal within the meaning of either (a) or (b) of s. 575 (c);

3. A formed opinion of the Judge,
before whom the conviction for the substantive offence took place, that, by
reason of the criminal habits and mode of life of the convicted offender, it is
expedient for the protection of the public that a further sentence, ordering
his detention in a prison for an indeterminate period be passed;

4. An actual passing of such
an additional sentence.

As it appears, a mere admission
or finding under s. 575 (c), though a condition precedent, is not
sufficient for, under s. 575 (b), the judge must also be of opinion
that, for reasons therein stated, it is expedient for the protection of the
public to pass, in addition to the one given as to the substantive offence, a
sentence for an indeterminate period, and must actually pronounce such
additional sentence.

Part X(A) does not authorize a
charge for being a habitual criminal to obtain independently. And, moreover,
the Part has no effective application unless the substantive charge for the
criminal offence is prosecuted and found.

In brief, the object of the Part
is not to create a new crime but, to use the relevant terms of the title
of the English Act, ""To make better provision for the prevention of crime
and for that purpose to provide for… the prolonged detention of habitual
criminals…""

Dealing with (b):—As
indicated by the title ""Speedy trials of Indictable Offences"",
as well as clearly stated in s. 825 and s. 582, the provisions of Part XVIII—including
the right to elect to have an offence tried before a judge

[Page 397]

alone—have no application except
in the case of certain indictable offences. And as speedy trials are a marked
departure from the common law, and as the provisions related thereto establish
a special statutory jurisdiction which cannot be extended beyond the terms of
the statute, not only would it be necessary for the appellant to show
successfully that to be a habitual criminal is a criminal offence, but that
this criminal offence is indictable. In the general pattern followed by
Parliament, when a new offence is created, the nature of the offence is always
and must of necessity be given, for it is the ascribed nature of the offence
that determines the course of proceedings for its prosecution. This Parliament
does—for an indictable offence—in stating either that the offence is indictable
or that the offender may be prosecuted by indictment and—in the case of an
offence which is not indictable—by describing it purely and simply as an
""offence"" or by stating that the offender is punishable on summary
conviction. In this respect, and for the obvious reason that Parliament did not
purport to create an offence, Part X(A) is denuded of any indication. It is
true that s. 575 (c) s-s. 2 provides:

In any indictment under this
section it shall be sufficient, after changing the crime, to state that the offender
is a habitual criminal.

But the indictment to which this
sub-section refers is manifestly the one reciting the substantive offence; and
while a conviction on such indictment is a condition precedent to the
substantial operation of Part X(A), an acquittal on the same brings the whole
matter to an end.

If, as the appellant must contend
to succeed, to be a habitual criminal is effectively an indictable offence,
there was no need for Parliament to enact, in positive language, the provisions
of the opening section of Part X(A), i.e., s. 575 (a), to empower a judge
acting under Part XVIII to apply the provisions of Part X(A), for such
jurisdiction was already given to him by s. 825 and s. 582. But, and because
Parliament did not mean to create an indictable offence coming within the
jurisdiction ratione materiae of a judge acting under Part XVIII, it was
necessary to enact s. 575 (a) to enable him to apply the provisions of
Part X(A).

In my respectful view, this first
ground cannot be entertained.

[Page 398]

The second point of dissent is:—

Alternatively the charge of
being a habitual criminal, if it is not a charge of a criminal offence, so
materially affects the punishment that may be imposed that the accused is
entitled to notice of the habitual criminal proceedings before being called
upon to elect as to the mode of trial on the substantive offence.

If, as above concluded, to be a
habitual criminal is not an offence and there is no jurisdiction ratione
materiae under Part XVIII but simply a power given by s. 575 (a) of
the new part to a judge acting under Part XVIII to apply the provisions of Part
X(A), then there is no text of law to justify this second contention. To accept
it would effectively be tantamount to amend the speedy trial provisions, in
making them applicable to the charge of being a habitual criminal, and in
conditioning the election of the substantive charge for an indictable offence
to the addition of a formality unprovided for in s. 827 to cover a case never
contemplated when Part XVIII was first enacted, i.e. at a time when neither
Part X(A) nor even the Prevention of Crime Act were law.

Furthermore, the reason
underlying this second proposition is not consonant but inconsistent with the
economy of the Criminal Code . It is said that the charge of being a
habitual criminal so materially affects the punishment that may be imposed,
that the accused is entitled to notice of the habitual criminal proceedings
before being called upon to elect as to the mode of trial on the substantive
charge; and in support of this proposition, reference is made to Rex v. Armitage[16].
At the time of this decision, there were in Canada, as to the advisability
to refer to previous conviction or convictions in a charge for an offence for
which a greater punishment may be inflicted by reason of such previous
conviction or convictions, two schools of thought amongst the members of the
judiciary. One view was that it was unfair to the accused to have, at the very
outset of the procedure, no notice of the intention of the Crown to ask for the
greater punishment provided in such cases. The other view was that a reference,
on the charge, to such previous convictions was unfair because prejudicing the
case as to the offence charged. These two views led to conflicting jurisprudence
and, in 1943, by 7 George VI

[Page 399]

c. 23, the Code was
amended and Parliament, adopting the latter view, prohibited any reference to
such previous conviction or convictions in all proceedings under Parts XV, XVI
and XVIII before conviction on the substantive offence. It was then clearly
enacted that no information or no charge for an offence for which greater
punishment may be inflicted by reason of previous conviction or convicitions,
shall contain any reference to such previous conviction or convictions. The Armitage
case, consistent with the first view, was decided before such amendment.

Furthermore, the whole matter,
being one of sentence—as was decided in the Hunter case—is one beyond
the field of election which is strictly related to the trial of the offence as
to which the right of election is given and has nothing to do with the
sentence.

With deference for those who
entertain on the whole matter a contrary opinion, I must, for the above
reasons, conclude that this appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA

Fraud—Undue Influence—Agreement for sale—Excessive price
demanded by Purchaser to release Vendor—Unconscionable Bargain—Relationship of
Parties.

Barristers and Solicitors—Solicitor acting for both
parties—Where neither connivance nor negligence shown, not subject to
strictures.

An elderly couple entered into an agreement to sell a property
at a price satisfactory to them at the time. Subsequently to secure a release
therefrom they paid a large amount demanded by the purchaser, to the solicitor,
who in the drawing of the agreement and the release acted for both parties. In
an action to cancel the release, set aside the agreement, and recover damages
from the purchaser and the solicitor jointly.

Held: 1. In the light of the evidence since no
relationship was established to make it the duty of the purchaser to take care
of the vendors, a claim to set aside the release and recover payment failed. Tufton
v. Sperni [1952] 2 T.L.R. 516 at 519.

2. The trial judge rightly held that the solicitor neither by
himself nor by connivance with the purchaser had imposed the bargain on the
vendors.

[Page 208]

3. The release was net an unconscionable, bargain in the sense
in which the term is used in the cases but, if the Court had been able to
arrive at the opposite conclusion, it would agree with the trial judge that the
vendors could not secure any relief so long as they claimed they were entitled
to set aside the original agreement.

Appeal allowed and judgment at trial [1951-52] 4 W.W.R. (N.S.)

against both defendants.

R. D. Guy, Q.C. for the appellant Petty.

L. St. G. Stubbs and H. P. Beahan for
the respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Kerwin J.:—The
respondents Louis Gronbach and his wife, Dinah Elizabeth Gronbach, signed the
document of January 13, 1949, fully understanding its nature and effect, and
there is no doubt that, at the time, the agreement was entirely satisfactory to
them. It was said in the Court of Appeal that the agreement was impossible of
performance by Mrs. Gronbach because she was not the owner of the stock in
trade. An inventory was to be taken of it on the evening of January 31, 1949,
and Petty was to pay for it in cash at wholesale prices. Accepting the position
that Mrs. Gronbach alone was the ""vendor"" under the agreement, there
would have been nothing to prevent the Court ordering specific performance
thereof against her to the extent to which that was possible. She had agreed to
the sale of the lands and premises, which would include any fixtures owned by
her, for $35,000 and the money to be paid for the stock in trade was in
addition to that sum. In our view the evidence discloses that Louis Gronbach,
the owner of the stock in trade, had agreed to its sale, but, in any event,
even if that be not so, the situation as between Mrs. Gronbach and Petty would
not be affected. The agreement could, therefore have been performed by Mrs.
Gronbach in the manner indicated.

[Page 209]

Leaving aside for the moment the question of The Dower
Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 55, there was therefore no reason why Mr. and Mrs.
Gronbach and Petty could not agree to the cancellation of the agreement. The
suggestion that this should be done came from the Gronbachs and, while the sum
of $8,000 demanded by Petty for the release of January 21, 1949, is large, we
cannot find that any relationship existed between Petty, on the one hand, and
the Gronbachs, on the other, to make it the duty of the former to take care of
the latter. As stated by Sir Raymond Evershed M.R. in Tufton v. Sperni
3: ""Extravagant liberality and
immoderate folly do not of themselves provide a passport to equitable
relief."" Therefore, the claim to set aside the release and recover the
$8,000 from Petty fails.

The trial judge has dealt satisfactorily in most respects
with the position of the appellant Brock and we are of opinion that he came to
the right conclusion that the solicitor, neither by himself nor by connivance with
Petty, imposed on the Gronbachs the bargain demanded by Petty. We also agree
that it has not been shown that the solicitor was negligent. For these reasons
we must with respect express our disagreement with any of the strictures passed
by the Court of Appeal upon the solicitor and, therefore, the decisions
referred to in their reasons for judgment on that aspect of the matter are not
applicable.

Under the circumstances as shown in the evidence, the
release cannot be held to be an unconscionable bargain in the sense in which
that term is used in the cases but, if we had been able to arrive at the
opposite conclusion, we would, then agree with the trial judge that the
Gronbachs cannot secure any relief when they persist in their attitude that
they are entitled to set aside the original document of January 13, 1949. The
Court has no jurisdiction to reopen the cancellation agreement and decree what
ought to be paid by the Gronbachs to Petty.

The Dower Act was never referred to in the pleadings
or at the trial and it was only after the hearing before the Court of Appeal
that that Court requested argument upon the point. Mr. Fillmore pointed out
that if it had been raised, evidence might have been led to show of what, if
anything, the homestead consisted. The Manitoba Dower

[Page 210]

Act is not the same as the Alberta Statute considered
recently by this Court in McColl-Frontenac Oil Co. Ltd. v. Hamilton 4, but even if the proper
conclusion would be that the agreement of January 13, 1949, so far as any
homestead of Mrs. Gronbach is concerned, was absolutely null and void for all
purposes, and assuming that the point is open on the pleadings and should be dealt
with by an Appellate Court, the money paid under the release of January 21,
1949, was paid under a mistake in law.

The option of January 21, 1949, (exhibit 7), was not binding
on Mrs. Gronbach but no order need now be made as the two years from February
1, 1949, referred to in that document have already expired. We also agree that
the agreement of January 13, 1949, was not binding upon the respondent
Frederick Gronbach. The fact that no order as to costs was made by the trial
judge sufficiently takes care of both these matters as the main dispute was as
to the position of Louis and Dinah Elizabeth Gronbach under the agreement of
January 13, 1949, and under the release. The appeals are allowed with costs
here and in the Court of Appeal and the judgment at the trial restored. The
cross-appeal is dismissed without costs.

Appeal allowed with costs.

Queen (Defendant) Respondent.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Extra-judicial
admissions—Whether jury need be warned of danger of convicting solely on
confession—Sufficiency of charge—Whether defence theory adequately put to the
jury.

On the strength of his three self
incriminating declarations, the appellant was charged with a murder which had
remained unsolved for more than two years. Two of his admissions were made
verbally to friends of his and the third was contained in a statement to the
police in his own handwriting and accepted by the Courts as having been given
freely and voluntarily. The appellant did not give evidence before the jury and
the theory of the defence was that although he had in fact made the statements
they were untrue. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.
Two questions of law were submitted on appeal to this Court, namely, whether
the jury had been adequately instructed as to the theory of the defence and
whether they should have been warned as to the danger of convicting when the
only evidence connecting the accused with the crime was his unsworn
extra-judicial admissions.

Held (Cartwright
J. dissenting), that the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Rinfret
C.J., Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Fauteux JJ.: There was no legal duty for
the trial judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting the appellant of
murder even if, in their view, the only evidence to connect him with the crime
consisted of his unsworn extrajudicial admissions.

There was in fact independent evidence
tending to support the accused’s admissions of having participated in the
commission of the murder; the jury were adequately instructed as to the theory
of the defence, namely, that the admissions were untrue, and of the numerous
points which, in the appellant’s submission, should have been brought to their
attention, some were actually submitted to them by the trial judge and those
which were not had either no foundation on the

[Page 221]

evidence or if they had, were denuded of any
real significance in the test of the truthfulness of the material admission.
The allotment of any substance to an argument or of any value to a grievance
resting on the omission of the trial judge from mentioning such argument must
be conditioned on the existence in the record of some evidence or matter apt to
convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the grievance.

Per Cartwright
J. (dissenting): The authorities cited by the appellant do not formulate a rule
of law that, in cases in which the only evidence to connect one accused of
murder with the crime consists of his unsworn extra-judicial admissions, the
trial judge must warn the jury that it is dangerous to convict.

It was however the duty of the trial judge to
impress upon the jury the necessity of testing the truth of the admissions made
by the accused by an examination of the other facts proved, and to call their
attention to the circumstances mainly relied upon by the defence as tending to
cast doubt upon the truth of the admissions, and this duty he failed to
perform.

APPEAL from the oral judgment delivered by
the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the appellant’s conviction for
murder.

A.E. Maloney for the appellant.

W.B. Common Q.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice, Rand,
Kellock, Estey, Locke and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:—

FAUTEUX J.—On the 18th of September 1952, a jury
of the Supreme Court of Ontario found that the appellant, “on or about the 9th
day of December 1949, at the Township of Thorold, in the County of Welland, did
unlawfully murder Sam Delibasich”.

An appeal against this verdict was unanimously
dismissed; the oral reasons delivered by the Chief Justice of the Province, at
the conclusion of the argument, being:—

We see no reason for disturbing the verdict
of the jury in this case. We think that statements of the accused admitted in
evidence were voluntary statements and properly admitted. We consider the
charge of the learned trial judge to the jury was adequate. The appeal must be
dismissed.

The appellant then obtained leave to appeal to
this Court on two questions of law, namely:—

(a) Did the learned judge err
in failing to instruct the jury adequately as to the theory of the defence?

(b) Did the learned trial judge err
in failing to instruct the jury as to the danger of convicting the accused of
murder where the only evidence to connect him with the crime consists of his
unsworn extra-judicial admissions?

[Page 222]

For a proper consideration of these questions,
the main features of the case may, at first, be related.

Sam Delibasich, a taxi operator of the city of
Welland, was last seen alive in that city at 6.30 p.m. on Friday, the 9th of
December 1949. In the late afternoon of the following day, Saturday the 10th,
his cab was observed in the west-end of the city of Toronto, in a parked
position in front of a building, number 2111 Bloor Street West, by a resident
of these premises, one Mrs. Bell who, a few days after, reported to the
police the fact of its continued presence. A week later, on Saturday the 17th,
the body of Delibasich was discovered, by a hunter, in the middle of a ploughed
field off of the Hurricane East Road, at some 4 or 5 miles from the city of
Welland. The Provincial Police were immediately alerted; a call went out for
the cab which the Toronto police—already apprised of its presence on Bloor
Street—towed into custody.

From the investigation, particularly of the
body, of the place and surroundings where it was found and of the cab itself,
no clues connecting any one with the murder could be found. However, and as the
evidence before the jury indicates, the following facts were then ascertained.
The body of the victim was lying some 300 feet from the road, face down, with
the arms extended and frozen stiff. The clothing was intact and mud-stained. No
footprints and no indication of a scuffle were found in the field. The autopsy
revealed on the front of the body depressions leading to the opinion that,
while warm, it had lain on an irregular surface, the imprint of which was left
during the freezing process. There were several wounds, the fatal ones having
been inflicted on the head by a blunt instrument and six others—three before
and three after death—caused by a rigid, round and pointed instrument. Death
was attributed to fracture of the skull and injury of the brain.

The victim was known to usually carry on his
person, in a wallet, substantial sums of money, but an amount of $13 only,
mostly in silver, and loose in his pocket, was found. The operator’s badge and
operating permits usually attached to the sun-visor of the cab, and any other
identification papers were missing. Whether there was in the cab any indication
of a struggle or any blood is not shown in the evidence.

[Page 223]

This crime had remained unsolved for more than
two years when the Crown acquired direct evidence, in the form of three
self-incriminating declarations made by the appellant—each of them at different
times and to different persons—on the strength of which the latter was
prosecuted for murder. Two of these admissions were made verbally by the
appellant to friends of his, the first, in September, 1951, to one Aubrey
Leslie Merritt, whom he had known since childhood, and who, after long
hesitation, i.e., in January, 1952, apprised the police of the same; the
second, to Blanche Lucy Benner, of the city of Welland, with whom he had
intimate relations and who reluctantly related these admissions to the police
after his arrest. The third appears in a statement to the police made by the
appellant in his own handwriting and accepted by the two Courts below as having
been given freely and voluntarily.

The substance of the facts related by the
appellant on these three occasions is:—On the night of the disappearance of Sam
Delibasich, the appellant and his brother Lloyd met at the Reeta Hotel in
Welland where they consumed a small quantity of beer. They there and then
agreed “to make some quick money” and to hire Delibasich’s cab, drive out of
town, “knock him out” and take his cab to Toronto to sell it.—Incidentally, it
may be noted that the appellant, his brother and their mother were also of the
city of Welland, and knew the taxi operator very well.—In furtherance of this
plot, they called Delibasich, hired his cab and drove with him to
St. Catharines when, nearing Port Robinson Road, they required him to
stop. Their victim was then struck, at first with a hammer and then with an
ice-pick, the latter instrument being used “to finish him”, according to what
the appellant said to Merritt, or “to make sure”, according to what he wrote
himself in his statement to the police. Having abandoned the body in a field,
they proceeded to Toronto, stopping, en route, at Toronto Bay to throw into
Lake Ontario the hammer, the ice-pick and some of the belongings of the victim.
Attempts to sell the cab at used car lots in Toronto being vain, it was left on
the street. They spent the night in the city and then returned to Welland.

The evidence also shows that a few days after
having confessed to police officers, the appellant freely consented to
accompany them to Toronto inorder to indicate, in the

[Page 224]

course of the journey, the various points having
any bearing on the case. He thus pointed out the road leading to the field
where the body had been found, the route followed to reach the point of the Bay
from where he and his brother threw the hammer, the ice-pick, the operator’s
badge and the various papers of the victim into the lake. Though definitely
unfamiliar with the city of Toronto, he also indicated one of the used car lots
at which they vainly attempted to sell the cab and also the place where the
latter had been abandoned on Bloor Street. The latter point was not more than
200 feet away from the place where the cab had, more than two years before,
been observed by Mrs. Bell the day after the murder. The appellant was
unable to locate, in the same district, the hotel where they were alleged by
him to have registered under fictitious names, nor did the police subsequently
succeed in doing so: it appears however from the evidence that hotel
registration records were rather poorly kept if at all in the hotels of this
particular district of the city.

This, in substance, was the evidence in the
record at the close of the case for the prosecution.

In defence, the subject matter of the evidence
adduced was limited to the character of the appellant. In this respect, the
record shows the absence of any previous convictions, that his past conduct
rendered unlikely his connection with the crime of murder and established the
particular frankness of the appellant. Though testifying on the voir dire, in
an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the production of his statement to the
police, the appellant did not however give any evidence before the jury,
leaving thus unchallenged by him the fact and the truth of his various
declarations. With the addition that nothing could be shown or found in the
record which would indicate or suggest any reason or motive prompting the
appellant to falsely charge himself and his own brother with the murder of a
person they both very well knew, this summary relates the main features of the
case.

Turning now to the points of law raised in this
appeal and dealing with the first one, i.e. whether the trial Judge erred in
failing to instruct the jury adequately as to the theory of the defence.

[Page 225]

The defence did not deny the fact but only the
truthfulness of the appellant’s admissions. This was the theory of the defence
at trial and the sole one suggested at the hearing before this Court. More than
once it was stated to the jury by the trial Judge in his charge. It is contended
however that this was not done adequately because the trial Judge failed to
direct the attention of the jury to some 19 or 20 alleged arguments purported
to be related to the theory of the defence. Whether all these arguments, which
a subsequent and minute examination of the record suggested to counsel for the
appellant, were actually formulated or even thought of before the jury by
counsel then acting for the accused, could not be asserted to us and is very
doubtful if one is to rely on the less numerous objections made at trial
immediately after the address of the judge. Be that as it may and as to the
merits of the contention itself, I must say that, after having carefully
considered each of the points on which it rests, I fail, in the light of the particular
features of this case, to see any real substance in it. In brief, some of these
points were actually submitted to the jury by the trial Judge and those which
were not are either without foundation on the evidence or, if they have, are
denuded of any real significance in the test of the truthfulness of the
material admission. This is all, I think, it is necessary to say on the matter
except as to two of these twenty points, which themselves illustrate the nature
of the others. Some comments may be found expedient in view of the importance
given to them by counsel for the appellant.

It is suggested that the trial Judge should have
commented on:—

(e) The failure of the police and
the appellant to locate the hotel at which he and his brother were supposed to
have registered and the inability of the police to find any such hotel
notwithstanding their intensive efforts to do so.

(h) The lack of any evidence of
blood or signs of a struggle in the victim’s taxi which serves strongly to
contradict the appellant’s statement to the police.

On (e):—As already indicated, the
evidence shows that registration records in hotels located in that particular
district were very poorly if at all kept. Moreover, at least two years had
elapsed since such registration was alleged to have been made and the moment
that verification of

[Page 226]

the fact was attempted. Under such
circumstances, I fail to see what real significance such evidence could have on
the question of the truthfulness of the appellant’s admissions.

As to (h):—It was conceded that the
presence or absence of blood in the cab was not even dealt with in the evidence
nor was either the absence or presence of signs of a struggle in the victim’s
taxi.

The allotment of any substance to an argument or
of any value to a grievance resting on the omission of the trial Judge from
mentioning such argument must be conditioned on the existence in the record of
some evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument and in
the grievance. Had the autopsy, for instance, revealed poisoning instead of
fracture of the skull as the cause of death, this undoubtedly would have, in
this case, been a point of substance relevant to the theory of the defence. Far
from conflicting with the appellant’s admissions, independent proof of certain
facts in the case tends to support his material admission, i.e. his
participation in the commission of the murder. These facts are:—The indication
by the appellant of the place he and his brother abandoned the cab
corresponding to the one at which it was found; the statement of the appellant
that the ice-pick was used once the victim had been struck with the hammer “to
finish him” or “to make sure” tallying with the opinion of the medicolegal
expert that six wounds had been made by a rigid, round and pointed instrument,
three before and three after death; the fact of the immediate disappearance of
his brother from Welland after the murder; the fact that nothing can be found
or was shown on the evidence in the nature of a reason or a motive moving the
appellant to make false admissions charging himself and his own brother with
the murder of a person they both knew very well.

In law, the general rule as again stated
recently in Azoulay v. The Queen[1],
is that the trial Judge in the course of his charge should review the substantial
part of the evidence and give the jury the theory of the defence so that
they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence and how the law is to
be applied to the facts as

[Page 227]

they find them. It is, of course, unnecessary
that the jury’s attention be directed to all of the evidence, and how far a
trial Judge should go in discussing it must depend in each case upon the nature
and character of the evidence in relation to the charge, the issues raised and
the conduct of the trial. In the words of Goddard, L.C.J. in Derek
Clayton-Wright[2]:

The duty of the Judge … is adequately and
properly performed ... if he puts before the jury clearly and fairly the
contentions on either side, omitting nothing from his charge, so far as the
defence is concerned, of the real matters upon which the defence is
based. He must give … a fair picture of the defence, but that does not mean to
say that he is to paint in the details or to comment on every argument which
has been used or to remind them of the whole of the evidence which has been
given by experts or anyone else.

The rule is simple and implements the
fundamental principle that an accused is entitled to a fair trial, to make a
full answer and defence to the charge, and to these ends, the jury must be
adequately instructed as to what his defence is by the trial Judge. Whether the
rule has in any given case been complied with may at times be difficult to
determine. In the present matter and for the reasons above given, I agree with
the members of the Court of Appeal for Ontario that the charge was sufficient.

The second ground of appeal is that the trial
judge erred “in failing to instruct the jury as to the danger of convicting the
accused of murder where the only evidence to connect him with the crime
consists of his extra-judicial admissions.”

This ground rests on the assumption of the fact
that the record discloses a complete lack of independent evidence tending to
support the truthfulness of the material admission made by the appellant. That
such an assumption does not flow from a consideration of the evidence and of
all the circumstances of this case I have endeavoured already to demonstrate.
However, and on the basis of a different view being held in the matter, the question
of law must be considered.

That the appellant could be legally convicted of
murder by a jury solely on his extra-judicial admissions, i.e. without any
corroborating evidence, is not disputed. What is suggested and what for the
success of the appeal on this

[Page 228]

point must be accepted, is that there was in
this case a legal duty for the trial judge to warn the jury of the danger of
doing so. No authorities or precedents in point were quoted on behalf of the
appellant, nor was it possible to find anyone to support this contention.

The only two cases to which our attention was
directed did not state or recognize such a rule of law. The first one is Rex
v. Sykes[3]. The
question there considered by the Court of Appeal was “how far the jury can rely
on these confessions,” i.e. the confessions made in that particular case.
Nothing in what was then stated by Ridley J., on behalf of the Court, purported
to be tantamount to a statement of a rule of law such as the one here contended
for, but was indeed only an approval of the impeached instructions given to the
jury by the Commissioner in that particular case. The question of warning was
not dealt with. In the second case, Rex v. Rubletz[4], the ratio decidendi is that the
trial judge, having determined that the confession made by the accused was free
and voluntary, so instructed the jury, but in a manner confusing the two
issues, i.e. the one related to the free and voluntary character of the
confession and the other in respect to its veracity. On the latter point
Turgeon C.J., speaking for the Court, stated at page 252:—

If this confession was not free and
voluntary, it would not be before the jury at all. Being there, it is the
jury’s duty to find whether or not it is true. This issue is different from the
issue of admissibility which was before the Judge, and necessitates an inquiry
going much further afield. Unfortunately, the instruction given to the jury on
this all-important subject seems to me to have fallen short of what was
required and to have tended to make the jury think that, if the statement was
free and voluntary, it was true.

Nowhere in the case does the Court suggest that
a warning should have been given to the jury. Reference may be made to what the
Chief Justice said at page 251:—

It does not follow, because a person comes
forward freely and voluntarily and declares that he has committed a crime,
declares, for instance, that another person supposed to have died a natural
death, was in reality murdered by him, that his declaration must be accepted as
true and that he must be convicted of murder. A jury may convict him: Rex v.
Falkner & Bond 168 E.R. 908; R. v. Tippet 168 E.R. 923;
but before doing so they ought to be instructed by the Judge in such a manner
as to call their attention to all the circumstances surrounding the case and
which may affect the truth or falsity of the confession.

[Page 229]

In my opinion, the learned trial judge in the
present case having complied with the rule above considered in relation to the
first ground of appeal, nothing more, on the matter, was required in his
address to the jury.

The appeal should be dismissed.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The facts out of
which this appeal arises are stated in the reasons of my brother Fauteux. I
shall not repeat them but wish to mention the following additional details
which appear to me to be of some importance. The witnesses, Merritt and
Mrs. Benner, each of whom testified that the accused had confessed to
taking part in killing Delibasich also testified that they did not believe his
confession. After the accused had been arrested on a charge of murder his first
statement to the police amounted to an assertion of his innocence. Shortly
afterwards, following a question and an admonition, the accused, in the
presence of the police officers, wrote out the confession which was admitted as
Exhibit 8 at the trial.

The accused did not give evidence before the
jury, but it is not, I think, open to question that both the fact of the three
statements having been made and their truthfulness, if made, were put in issue
by the plea of “not guilty.” The theory of the defence was that although the
accused had in fact made the statements they were untrue and he had had nothing
to do with the killing of Delibasich.

Leave was granted to appeal to this Court on the
following points:—

(a) Did the learned trial judge err
in failing to instruct the jury adequately as to the theory of the defence?

(b) Did the learned trial judge err
in failing to instruct the jury as to the danger of convicting the accused of
murder where the only evidence to connect him with the crime consists of his
unsworn extra-judicial admissions?

As to the second of these points counsel for the
appellant relied on certain observations in the unanimous judgment of the Court
of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Walter Sykes[5].
In that case there was ample evidence, as in the case at bar, that a murder had
been committed. The accused had made statements to two witnesses, one of whom
was a police inspector, to the effect that he was the murderer. Later he had
retracted these statements.

[Page 230]

The following passages in the judgment at pages
236 and 237 are relevant:—

It would have been unsatisfactory to
convict on the evidence had it not been assisted by the confession, and
probably it would have been unsatisfactory if the conviction rested on the
confessions only, without the circumstances which make it probable that the
confessions were true.

The main point, however, is one independent
of all these details, the question how far the jury could rely on these
confessions. I think the Commissioner put it correctly; he said:

A man may be convicted on his own
confession alone; there is no law against it. The law is that if a man makes a
free and voluntary confession which is direct and positive, and is properly
proved, a jury may, if they think fit, convict him of any crime upon it. But
seldom, if ever, the necessity arises, because confessions can always be tested
and examined, first by the police, and then by you and us in Court, and the
first question you ask when you are examining the confession of a man is, is
there anything outside it to show that it was true? is it corroborated? are the
statements made in it of fact so far as we can test them true? was the prisoner
a man who had the opportunity of committing the murder? is his confession
possible? is it consistent with other facts which have been ascertained and
which have been, as in this case, proved before us?

It was said that the murder was the talk of
the countryside, and it might well be that a man under the influence of
insanity or a morbid desire for notoriety would accuse himself of such a crime.
I agree that this is so, but it was a question for the jury, and they ought to
see whether it was properly corroborated by facts, and so they were directed.
We think that this part of the case was quite sufficiently left to the jury,
and the Court thinks that there is no reason for giving leave to appeal.

This case was cited with approval by Turgeon
C.J.S. giving the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in
Rex v. Rubletz[6], also
relied upon by counsel for the appellant. The learned Chief Justice said in
part:—

It does not follow, because a person comes
forward freely and voluntarily and declares that he has committed a crime, declares,
for instance, that another person supposed to have died a natural death, was in
reality murdered by him, that his declaration must be accepted as true and that
he must be convicted of murder. A jury may convict him: R. v. Falkner &
Bond, 168 E.R. 908; R. v. Tippet, 168 E.R. 923; but before doing so
they ought to be instructed by the Judge in such a manner as to call their
attention to all the circumstances surrounding the case and which may affect
the truth or the falsity of the confession.

The learned judge decided that the
statement was nevertheless a free and voluntary one, and I think he was right
in so deciding. But a free and voluntary statement may, nevertheless, be false.
Men have been known to accuse themselves falsely of the most heinous offences,
fully conscious, sometimes, of the falsity of their avowal, and imagining at
other times, that their souls were in fact charged with crime. If this
confession was not free and voluntary, it would not be before the jury

[Page 231]

at all. Being there, it is the jury’s duty
to find whether or not it is true. This issue is different from the issue of
admissibility which was before the judge, and necessitates an inquiry going
much further afield.

I do not read these judgments as formulating a
rule of law that, in cases in which the only evidence to connect one accused of
murder with the crime consists of his unsworn extra‑judicial admissions,
the trial judge must warn the jury that it is dangerous to convict; but I think
that they furnish a guide as to the way in which, in such cases, the judge
should perform the duty which always rests upon him of laying the theory of the
defence adequately and fairly before the jury.

In such cases, and especially when the accused
has not given evidence, I think it incumbent upon the trial judge, (i) to
impress upon the jury the necessity of testing the truthfulness of the
admissions by an examination of the other facts and circumstances proved, and
(ii) to call their attention, not necessarily to all the circumstances, but to
those mainly relied upon by the defence as tending to cast doubt upon the
truthfulness of the confession. In the case at bar I have reached the
conclusion that neither of these duties was adequately performed.

In the argument before us and in his factum,
counsel for the appellant referred to nineteen matters which, in his
submission, might well cause the jury to doubt the truth of the confession, of
which only two were specifically mentioned by the learned trial judge in his
charge. I do not propose to examine each of the items in this list. Several of
them appear to me to be unimportant but I wish to refer to three of them. (i)
It is apparent from the evidence of Inspector Wood that the accused had told
him that after abandoning Delibasich’s taxi-cab in Toronto, he and his brother
walked to a hotel at which they registered and spent the night of December 9,
1949; but a most careful and extensive search by the police had failed to
locate any record of registration or other evidence to substantiate this. (ii)
If the confession was true, the motive for the murder was robbery but some $13
was found on the person of the deceased. (iii) If the confession was true, it
would seem probable that there would have been some bloodstains in the taxi-cab
but there was no evidence as to whether any such stains were found by the
police. None

[Page 232]

of these three matters was referred to by the
learned trial judge in his charge. Counsel for the accused specifically
requested that the attention of the jury be called to the item thirdly
mentioned. I am respectfully of the opinion that they should have been put
before the jury and further, since the theory of the defence was that the
accused had fabricated the confession, the learned trial judge should have
pointed out that there was no detail in the confession verified by any evidence
extraneous to it which might not have come to the accused’s knowledge through
reading of the crime in the press. The learned trial judge in another
connection mentioned to the jury that he remembered reading about the
occurrence in the newspapers. No doubt, as in the Sykes case, “the murder was
the talk of the countryside.” I do not intend to suggest that had any or all of
these matters been mentioned to the jury their verdict would necessarily, or
probably, have been different, but I can not satisfy myself it might not have
been.

How then did the learned trial judge present the
theory of the defence to the jury? The following passages in the charge appear
to me to be the only ones which deal with it:—

While I am on this subject, I want to say
to you that that is the way you may interpret the evidence of the statement,
this very important statement which has been put in and which was given by the
accused. It will be before you in evidence. It is true that this is not sworn
evidence but, gentlemen, it is evidence in the case. You may interpret that
statement like any other evidence. You may believe all of it; you may think
that statement is true. There may be parts that you may think are not true, or
you may think as the defence asks you to, that it is not true at all.

. .
.

But in this case most of the evidence is
direct. It is direct evidence of the accused himself if you believe it. He has
signed a statement telling what happened. There is the evidence of two
witnesses who say he told them what happened. That, gentlemen, is direct
evidence, and it is a question of whether you believe it or not.

Gentlemen, in this case I have concluded
that I do not need to charge you upon the question of manslaughter, and for
this reason. I have not heard any evidence upon which a jury could find a
verdict of manslaughter. Believe me, if there was any such evidence it would be
my duty to draw it to your attention, and I would be most happy to do so, but I
cannot on this evidence, on the evidence I have heard, find any evidence that
would justiny a verdict of manslaughter. Indeed, and I ask Mr. Martin, who
has so ably defended this young man, to see if I state it correctly, the whole
theory of the defence is that this accused had nothing to do with this crime;
that these stories were not true, and if that theory is accepted by you, or if
you have an honest doubt whether that is the correct theory or not, the verdict
will be a complete acquittal.

. .
.

[Page 233]

The theory of the defence, and you must
consider it, gentlemen, because it is always important, is that that statement
which was signed by the accused is not true at all; that having told the story
once, he went right along with the thing. You must give consideration and
thought as to that, gentlemen. But I suggest to you that you must also
consider, and it is entirely for you to say, would a person sign a statement
like that after being warned that he was charged with murder and was not
required to say anything; would he do that if it were not true? You may think
so. You are the judges of the facts, and it is entirely for you to say.

With the deepest respect for the learned trial
judge, I find myself in agreement with the submission of counsel for the
appellant that the theory of the defence was mentioned only to be brushed
aside. Conceding that the theory was not a strong one, it was nonetheless
necessary that it be adequately presented to the jury and for the reasons I
have set out above I think this was not done.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and direct a new trial.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA

Criminal law—Murder—Drunkenness as defence—Capacity to
form intent —Proper directions—Word ""proved"" should not be used in
charge.

In a case where drunkenness is set up as a defence to a charge
of murder, the trial judge should not use the word ""proved"", as taken
from the third proposition formulated in Beard's case ([1920] A.C. 479
at 502), as Lord Birkenhead was not there dealing with the question of the
burden of proof. The right direction in such cases appears at page 334 in Mac
Askill v. The King ([1931] S.C.R. 330).

The charge, in the present case, which included the use of
that word would be improper if it were not for the clear directions from the
trial judge that the accused was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable
doubt as to his capacity to form the necessary intent.

A.C. 479; Mac Askill v. The King [1931] S.C.R. 330; The King

S.C.R. 19 referred to.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba 1, affirming the conviction of the
appellant on a charge of murder.

J. L. Crawford for the appellant. The defence of gross
intoxication was not fairly presented to the jury and the evidence of
drunkenness was unduly minimized. The decisions show that the trial judge must
present the defence of the accused adequately and fairly to the jury, together
with the evidence in support thereof. His presentation must insure the jury's
appreciating (a) the nature and value of the evidence bearing upon the defence
and (6) the full significance of the evidence as related to the essential
questions of fact upon which guilt depends. Above all, the evidence in support
of a defence must be presented to the jury as carefully as the case for the
prosecution.

The trial judge neglected to tell the jury the limited purpose
and use of evidence of character and criminal record which may have prejudiced
the appellant. He should have instructed the jury that this evidence could only
go towards the credibility of his testimony in the witness stand and was not
proof of the charge against him.

[Page 336]

The trial judge misdirected the jury on the defence of
drunkenness as affecting the capacity of the appellant to form the necessary
intention to constitute murder. The jury should have been instructed that in
order to find the accused guilty of murder they must (a) be sure beyond
a reasonable doubt that the accused had the necessary capacity to be able to
intend to commit murder; (b) that the crown had proved beyond a
reasonable doubt that at the time the accused fired the gun, he intended to
kill the deceased, or that he intended to inflict bodily injury which was known
to the accused at the time he fired the shot to be likely to cause death and
that the accused was reckless as to whether or not death ensued. MacAskill
v. The King 2.

The trial judge erred in instructing the jury that the accused
was presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act when in fact the
presumption had been rebutted and no longer had any probative value against
positive evidence of intoxication.

The trial judge erred in instructing the jury that a proved
incapacity on the part of the accused to form the necessary intention was
necessary in order that the jury would be able to find the accused guilty of
manslaughter.

The trial judge erred in instructing the jury to the effect
that an amnesic condition of the accused was necessary to find the appellant
guilty of manslaughter.

W. J. Johnston for the respondent. The defence of gross
intoxication was fairly presented and the evidence of drunkenness was not
minimized. The trial judge dealt at length with that defence.

The reference to ""a proved incapacity of forming the specific
intent"" was taken from the Beard's case 3, and it is
quoted, adopted and followed by this Court in the MacAskill case (supra)
and in Latour v. The King 4. The statement, itself,
places no onus on the defence of proving incapacity and even if it could be
said, that standing alone, without explanation, it might conceivably be so
construed, the jury in the present case could not possibly have been under any
such misapprehension. The trial judge made the statement only once in the whole
course of his very

[Page 337]

long charge and followed it immediately by pointing out that
""if on any point whatever, you have a reasonable doubt, that doubt must be
resolved in favour of the accused"".

In his charge the trial judge referred to the question of
amnesia on three occasions but he did so only in so far as it was necessary in
order to place before the jury a clear picture of the defence put forward by
the appellant in his evidence. This question of amnesia was raised by the
accused's evidence as part of his defence.

As to the ground of dissent stating that the intention to
shoot does not necessarily import capacity to commit murder and to so instruct
the jury was misdirection, it is submitted that the jury could not but
appreciate and understand that the question for their consideration was: Did
the accused have the capacity to form an intent to kill or the capacity to form
an intent to do grievous bodily injury together with the capacity to know that
death would be likely to ensue therefrom.

The jury were instructed in clear and unequivocal terms that
they were not trying the accused on his relationship with the Kafkas but solely
on the charge of murder and that in considering the truthfulness of the
accused's evidence they could have regard for the evasiveness of his answers
with respect to the Kafkas situation. It is true that the trial judge did not,
in express words, instruct the jury that the accused's record could not be
considered by them for any other purpose than in judging his truthfulness, but
having dealt with it solely on the issue of credibility and in view of the
comparative insignificant nature of the conviction, the omission to do so was
not such an error as would mislead the jury.

On the evidence presented at the trial any reasonable jury
would be entitled to find that the accused fired the gun and that prior to the
shooting he had consumed a considerable quantity of liquor. The only question
of substance that remained for consideration was the effect of the alleged
intoxication of the accused on his capacity to form the intent necessary to the
crime of murder, and there was ample evidence from which any jury could find
that there was no reasonable doubt as to the accused's capacity to have that
intent.

[Page 338]

The instruction that a man is presumed to intend the natural
consequences of his act was normal and proper. The appellant, however, contends
that it should not have been given in view of the evidence of intoxication
which might have negatived the accused's capacity to have the intent therein referred
to. It is submitted on behalf of the respondent that the trial judge
effectively guarded against any such error by immediately instructing the jury
that the presumption would cease to apply in the event that there was any
reasonable doubt as to the accused's capacity or, to put it another way, that
the presumption applied only if they first found capacity in the accused beyond
all reasonable doubt.

While there may have been some minor defects in the charge,
none of them were of such a nature as could be regarded as having worked undue
hardship or prejudice upon the accused. The verdict was reasonable and no
miscarriage of justice occurred. Schmidt v. The King 5.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:—

Kerwin J.:—The
appellant's conviction of having murdered Detective Sergeant Sims in Winnipeg
was set aside by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba on the ground of misdirection
and non-direction but, on the new trial ordered by that Court, he was again
convicted. An appeal from that conviction to the Court of Appeal 6
was dismissed, Adamson J.A. dissenting, and, upon the six grounds of dissent
taken by the latter, the appellant now asks this Court to set aside the
conviction for murder and substitute one for manslaughter.

Sims died as a result of a shot fired by the appellant from
the latter's own shot-gun. This was not denied and the main defence was that of
drunkenness. The sixth ground of dissent is:—

6. In view of the cogent evidence of drinking and
intoxication, no reasonable jury properly instructed could find that there was
not a reasonable doubt as to the mental capacity of the accused to have the
intent necessary to the crime of murder.

In view of the result at which we have arrived, we are not
concerned with this ground if it means merely that the dissenting judge would
not only have set aside the con-

[Page 339]

viction but would have directed a verdict of manslaughter to
be entered. If, however, it means that there was nothing to go to the jury upon
which they could find the appellant guilty of murder, we are satisfied that
there was such evidence. It need not be detailed as it appears sufficiently in
the reasons for judgment of Coyne J.A.

The other five grounds of dissent are:—

1. The defence of gross intoxication was not fairly
presented and the evidence of drunkenness was unduly minimized.

2. It was misdirection to require a ""proved incapacity
of forming the specific intent"". This cast an improper onus on the
accused.

3. The suggestion that something approaching amnesia was
necessary to reduce the offence to manslaughter was misdirection.

4. Intention to shoot does not necessarily import capacity
to commit murder and to so instruct the jury was misdirection.

5. The neglect to tell the jury the limited purpose and use
of evidence of character and criminal record may have been prejudicial.

In connection with the first four, it will be recalled that
this was a second trial granted because of certain objections to the charge to
the jury on the first trial. The matters to be considered were, therefore,
present to the minds of all concerned and not least to the learned Chief
Justice of the King's Bench presiding at the new trial. In his charge he not
only dealt with the defences put forward on behalf of the accused but also with
others that he considered might possibly be open on the evidence. That, indeed,
as has been pointed out on many occasions, was his duty. Throughout his charge
he made it plain to the jury many times that the accused was entitled to the
benefit of any reasonable doubt they might have as to whether the Crown had
proved all the elements necessary to constitute the crime of murder. In
addition to this, at the request of counsel for the accused, he recalled the
jury and practically his last words to them were: ""If in your considerations
you come to any point whatever where you have a reasonable doubt on that point,
it must be resolved in favour of the accused.""

As to dissent No. 1, in dealing with the evidence of
drunkenness, the trial judge drew to the jury's attention everything that counsel
was able to point out to us had been said in evidence, with the one exception
that while the trial judge mentioned the evidence of Dr. Burland at the time of
the admission of the accused to the hospital, he

[Page 340]

did not refer specifically to what Dr. Burland said as to
the accused's condition about five hours later. With this exception, everything
relied upon by the accused in order to show his drunkenness at the time of the
occurrence was specifically mentioned by the trial judge. The real complaint of
the accused seems to be that the trial judge did not endorse all that had been
said upon the question of drunkenness but we have no doubt that the defence was
fairly presented and that the evidence of drunkenness was not minimized.

Dissent No. 2 refers to the passage in the charge where the
trial judge stated to the jury:—

Evidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved incapacity
of forming the specific intent necessary to constitute the crime and merely
establishing that the accused's mind was affected by drink so that he more
readily gave way to some violent passion does not rebut the presumption that a
man intends the natural consequences of his acts.

This is taken from the third proposition formulated by Lord
Birkenhead in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard 7.
The specific objection is to the word ""proved"". Beard's Case
is referred to in MacAskill v. The King 8, The
King v. Hughes 9 and Latour v. The King 10.
While it is quite true that section 260 (d) of the Criminal Code 
was added in 1947 as a result of the decision in the Hughes case, the
point upon which reference is now made to that decision is of importance in
considering the present appeal. It was there pointed out that in Beard's
Case it was proved that there was a violent struggle in which the accused
overpowered the child and stifled her cries by putting his hand over her mouth
and pressing his thumb upon her throat, the acts which, in her weakened state
resulting from the struggle, killed her. This, the House of Lords held, was
murder, although the accused had no intention of causing death. There was no
question that the act which caused the suffocation, the act of the prisoner in
placing his hand on the mouth of the victim, was his voluntary act. In the MacAskill
case it was pointed out at page 334 that the right direction in cases involving
subsection (b) of section 259 of the Code is that evidence of
drunkenness rendering the accused incapable of the state

[Page 341]

of mind defined by that subsection may be taken into account
with the other facts of the case for the purpose of determining whether or not
in fact the accused had the intent necessary to bring the case within that
subsection; but that the existence of drunkenness not involving such incapacity
is not a defence. In such cases that has the effect of altering the words
""a proved"" in proposition 3 in Beard's case to ""an
existing"" or some similar expression. In fact, Lord Birkenhead in
proposition No. 3 was not dealing with the question of burden of proof.
Notwithstanding that it was used in the present case, there is no doubt the
learned Chief Justice was not directing the jury on a question of onus and that
that is so is made abundantly clear by those parts of his charge that precede
and follow the extract given above. It is not a question of there being a
defect in the charge but of the charge as a whole being proper and being
delivered in such a form that the jury could not possibly misunderstand that
the onus throughout remained upon the Crown. Lord Birkenhead's third
proposition is also set out in the Latour case at page 29 but at that
point the question of onus was not being specifically dealt with. In order to
avoid any misunderstanding, we think it proper to state unequivocally that a
trial judge should not use the word ""proved"" in his charge in any
case where drunkenness is set up as a defence to a charge of murder. Such a
charge would be improper in the absence of clear directions, such as exist in
the present case, that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable
doubt as to the capacity of the accused to form the necessary intent.

As to dissent No. 3, Adamson J.A. suggested that the charge
indicated that something approaching paralysis of the mind was required before
the absence of capacity to form the necessary intention can be found. We must
say that we are unable to discover any such indication.

Dissent No. 4 is that at two stages of his charge the trial
judge directed the jury that capacity to intend to shoot was sufficient to
constitute an intention to commit murder. The first quotation made by the
dissenting judge is as follows:—

Gentlemen, it is on that evidence that you have to come to
the conclusion as to whether the accused at the time he fired that gun at Sims
was capable of forming an intent to shoot the man who was in front of him.
Remember that it didn't have to be Sims. He didn't have

[Page 342]

to know Sims. The question is, Was he capable of forming an
intent to shoot the human being in front of him when he fired that shot? There
is no question of motive in this case. Was he capable of forming an intent to
shoot Sims, not Sims as Sims, not Sims as Detective Sims, but Sims as the human
being that was standing before him in that room at the time he fired? If you
come to the conclusion that he wasn't, then he is guilty of manslaughter.

However, this must be read in connection with what
immediately follows:—

If you come to the conclusion that he was capable of forming
that intent, that he intended to shoot that human being in front of him, then
he is guilty of murder, subject to provocation or self-defence, and I will deal
with those very briefly afterwards. If, on the other hand, you have to go
further: If you find that he had an intent but if you decide that being capable
of forming an intent his intent wasn't to kill the man, you must ask
yourselves, Being capable of forming an intent, was his intent to do grievous
bodily harm to that man, knowing and being capable of knowing that what he did
was likely to result in death and being reckless as to whether death ensued or
not?

The second quotation reads—

What you have to decide on this question of drunkenness is,
Was the accused in such a state of drunkenness that he was unable to form an
intent to shoot that gun that night, that is, to commit the crime with which he
is charged? But if in your consideration of that question you have any
reasonable doubt, that is, for instance, if in considering the evidence of the
accused you feel that it might be true, that you have the impression in your
minds that it might be true, then that would raise a reasonable doubt in your
minds. Always, the benefit of the reasonable doubt must be given to the
accused.

Again, there must be added to that what immediately
follows:—

But if you come to the conclusion, after studying all the
evidence, that there was a capacity to form the intention to fire that shot at
that human being, then you ask yourselves, first of all, When he fired it did
he intend to kill? If he did, the matter stops there. But if when he fired it he
didn't intend to kill but intended only to do grievous bodily harm, then did he
also have the capacity to know that death would be likely to ensue from that
grievous bodily harm and was reckless.

Upon reading the whole of the charge, and particularly what followed
each of the quotations appearing in the dissenting judgment, it is made
abundantly clear that the trial judge was not giving any such direction as was
suggested.

The only remaining ground of dissent is No. 5. The jury were
instructed that they were not trying the appellant on his relationship with the
Kafkas but only on the charge of murder, and that in considering the
truthfulness of the

[Page 343]

appellant's evidence, they could have regard to the
evasiveness of his admissions with respect to the Kafkas situation. The trial
judge made but one reference to a previous conviction of the appellant of
firing a gun in the City of Winnipeg, and then only in connection with the
latter's credibility. The evidence of the appellant's character and of the previous
conviction was thus referred to only on the question of credibility.

The appeal fails and must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal
law—Corroboration—Rape—Complaint—Evidence.

The appellant, charged with rape, admitted
that he had had intercourse with the complainant, but swore that it had been
with her consent, which she denied saying that she had only submitted to it in
fear of bodily harm. His conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.

Held: There
should be a new trial; since the jury had not been properly instructed on the
question of corroboration and as to the limited use that may be made of the
evidence of complaint, it was impossible to say that if it had been properly
instructed it would necessarily have convicted the appellant.

Held: The
corroboration to be sought was of the complainant’s testimony that she did not
consent but only submitted in fear of bodily harm. In a case of this sort, when
there is any evidence on which a jury could find corroboration, the jury should
be directed as to what is necessary to constitute corroboration and it is then
for the jury to say whether corroborative inferences should be drawn. It was
not, in the present case, made plain to the jury (i) that corroboration could
be found only in evidence independent of the testimony of the complainant and
of such a character that it tended to show that her story on the vital question
of consent was true, and (ii) that facts, though independently established,
could not amount to corroboration if, in the view of the jury, they were
equally consistent with the truth as with the falsity of her story on this
point.

Held: It was
not made clear to the jury that in a case where a sexual offence is charged,
evidence of the making of a complaint is not corroborative of the testimony of
the complainant. Where corroboration is required either by statute or under the
rule of practice at common law, the corroborative evidence must be shown to
possess the essential quality of independence. It must be made plain to the
jury that the witness whose testimony requires corroboration can not
corroborate herself. (Rex v. Auger 64 O.L.R. 181 and Rex v. Calhoun [1949]
O.R. 180 ought not to be followed on that point).

Held: There
was failure to instruct the jury of the limited use that may be made of the
evidence of the complaint and to warn them against treating the complaint as
evidence of the facts complained of.

The King v. Baskerville [1916] 2 K.B. 658; The Queen v. Lillyman (1896) 2 Q.B. 167; Rex
v. Evans 18 C.A.R. 123; Rex v. Coulthread 24 C.A.R. and Rex v.
Whitehead [1929] 1 K.B. 99 referred to.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1] upholding the
conviction of the appellant on a charge of rape.

[Page 345]

A.E. Maloney for the appellant. On the first
question, it is a fatal error to fail to define corroboration to a jury in a
case of this nature since there is a danger that the jury might well have
regarded some item of evidence as being corroborative which is not capable of
being such in law: Rex v. Zielinski[2],
Rex v. Yott [3] and
Rex v. Hong Suey[4].

In connection with some of the matters which the
jury might have regarded as corroborative but which are not capable of being so
in law, the following cases are referred to: Rex v. Hubin[5], Rex v. Yates[6], Rex v. Gemmill[7].

It is no answer to this contention to say that
there is otherwise in the record ample evidence capable of corroborating the
evidence of the complainant, because the jury might well have failed to regard
it as such and might not have seen fit to act upon it: Rex v. Ross[8], Rex v. Hubin (supra).

On the second question, it is submitted that due
to the failure to define corroboration, it might well be that the jury may have
regarded the complaint to the husband as being corroboration of her testimony.
A complaint made in a sexual case is not capable in law of being corroboration,
which term is defined in Rex v. Baskerville[9]. It is not corroboration because it lacks
the essential quality of independence. It must serve to confirm not only that a
crime has been committed but also the identity of the accused as the person who
committed it. Independent means that it must emanate from some source other
than the complainant or the witness whose testimony requires corroboration.
Thus in a case of rape where the defence is consent, the offender’s admission
that he had carnal connection is sufficient corroboration of the complainant’s
testimony identifying the accused as the person with whom she had relations.
However, it then becomes necessary to search the record for independent
evidence to corroborate her testimony of non-consent. The following cases are

[Page 346]

referred to: Rex v. Evans[10], Rex v. Coulthread[11], Rex v. Whitehead[12], Rex v. Osborne[13], Reg. v. Lillyman[14] and Rex v. Lovell[15].

Because of the completely inadequate directions
on the third question, it may well be that the jury wrongly thought that they
could regard the complaint as evidence of the truth of the facts it contained: Reg.
v. Lillyman (supra), Rex v. Osborne (supra) and Rex v. Hill[16].

W.B. Common Q.C. for the respondent. The failure of the trial judge to define corroboration could have
had no practical result. The term as understood by laymen is self-explanatory.
Reference by the judge to all the circumstances in the evidence, which in law
were corroboration of non-consent, had the same effect as if he had in fact
defined the term. In the light of the evidence and the manner in which the
evidence of non-consent was left to the jury, it cannot be said, that, had the
term been exhaustively defined the jury could not have reached the same
conclusion: Rex v. Coulthread11 and Rex v. Zielenski[17].

It is a well established principle of law that
in cases involving a charge of rape, the evidence of complaint is not evidence
of the facts complained of, nor as being a part of the res gestae, but
as evidence of the consistency of the conduct of the complainant with the story
told by her in the witness box, and that what was done, was done without her
consent. It has been said that evidence of a complaint is corroboration of the
credibility of the complainant and where consent is an issue it is corroborative
of her evidence that she did not consent: Rex v. Osborne13.
It must be noted that nowhere does the trial judge categorically instruct the
jury that the evidence of complaint is to be treated by them as corroboration
of her story, or even as to her non-consent; furthermore, no proper inference
can be drawn from the charge that the complaint can be treated by the jury as
corroboration of all the evidence of the complainant. If, however, it might

[Page 347]

be inferred that the judge had left it to the jury
that the complaint could be treated as corroboration of her evidence and as to
her non-consent, it was only in a limited sense that the term was so used.

The term “corroboration” as defined in Rex v.
Baskerville[18] has
not necessarily the same implications when used in connection with the effect
of the evidence of a complaint in cases of rape. In cases requiring
corroboration by statute or common law, the term implies that not only was
there evidence tending to prove that the crime was committed, but in addition,
that it was committed by the accused or that the accused was a party to its
commission. In the wide sense of the term, corroboration connotes an aspect or
quality of independence, but where the term is used in relation that the
complaint is in corroboration of the complainant’s testimony, it simply means
that the complaint not only shows a consistency of conduct, but it may confirm
her evidence as to non-consent. The quality of independence, of course, cannot
be established, and consequently it is in this limited sense that the evidence
of complaint by its very nature confirms or corroborates the credibility of the
complainant and her evidence as to non-consent.

When the term in this sense is used it means
that the complaint adds an additional quality to the character of the
complainant’s evidence, and consequently her evidence is more worthy of credit
than if her testimony stood alone. In this sense the complaint is
corroboration.

In The Queen v. Lillyman[19], it was put that the test is whether
according to the principles of the exception, her having made the complaint
tends to corroborate testimony given by the child at the trial.

In our Courts it has been held that it is not
misdirection to the jury in a rape case to tell them that the complaint may be
taken as evidence negativing consent and in corroboration of its absence: Rex
v. Calhoun[20] and Rex
v. Auger[21].

[Page 348]

In Rex v. Coulthread[22], the term was used in its widest sense,
and left the impression with the jury that the complaint was independent
testimony that not only that the offence had been committed but that the
accused had committed it. No such language is to be found in the case at bar.

It is conceded that the trial judge omitted to
instruct the jury on the limited use that could be made of the complaint and
that the complaint should not be regarded as proof of the facts it contained,
but what he did say could not be interpreted that they were to take it as
conclusive evidence that the offence had been commited by the accused or that
there was non-consent. The language can only be interpreted as conveying that a
complaint in proper circumstances gives “greater probability” to her evidence
or corroborates or confirms her credibility as to non-consent. However, on this
ground, had the jury been properly instructed, they could have reached no other
conclusion. Rex v. Coulthread (supra).

Furthermore, on the facts as disclosed by the
evidence, and on the charge taken as a whole, there has been no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:—

CARTWRIGHT J.—This is an appeal from a judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[23]
dismissing an appeal from the conviction of the appellant before Treleaven J.
and a jury on a charge of rape.

The appeal is brought pursuant to an order of my
brother Kellock granting leave to appeal on the following questions of law:—

1. The Court of Appeal erred in failing to
find that the learned trial judge had erred in failing to define corroboration
to the jury.

2. The Court of Appeal erred in failing to
find that the complaint made by the complainant in this case as in any sexual
case is not capable as a matter of law of being corroborative of the
complainant’s testimony because it lacks the essential quality of independence.

3. The Court of Appeal erred in failing to
find that the learned trial judge had erred in failing to instruct the jury of
the limited use that could be made of the evidence of the complaint made by
complainant to her husband and particularly he erred in failing to instruct the
jury that the complaint must not under any circumstances be regarded by them as
proof of the truth of the facts it contained.

[Page 349]

The following summary of the evidence is taken
with some modifications and additions from the reasons for judgment of Roach
J.A. who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal[24].

The appellant is unmarried and twenty-one years
of age. The complainant is a married woman, thirty‑five years of age,
living with her husband and three children in the city of Hamilton.

In the evening of Tuesday, October 24, 1950, the
complainant, accompanied by a woman friend, attended a theatre in downtown Hamilton. After the show they went to a
cocktail lounge, where they had something to eat and the complainant had two
drinks of whiskey. After leaving the cocktail lounge about 12.45 o’clock, the friend boarded a bus to go
home and the complainant waited on the street corner for a bus that would take
her to her home. The appellant, driving his father’s car, came to the corner
and, seeing the complainant, stopped and beckoned to her and suggested he would
drive her home. The complainant at first demurred but shortly accepted the
invitation and entered the car. The appellant drove her to the front of her
home, where he stopped. According to the complainant, she sought to leave the
car promptly but the appellant suggested there was no hurry, grabbed her by the
wrist and set the car in motion. As the car rounded the nearby corner, she
screamed, leaned over and blew the horn with her free hand, and then grabbed
the steering wheel. In the scuffle, the car went up over a neighbour’s lawn.
The appellant straightened it out onto the highway and drove at a considerable
speed along a course that finally led to a lonesome section on the Hamilton Mountain. During the journey,
according to the complainant, she protested that she wanted to go home and she
started to cry. The appellant told her to stop crying and sit still. The car
was travelling at such a speed that she was afraid to jump out.

The complainant testified that when the
appellant finally stopped the car, she said that she was going to get out and
attempted to open the door. Thereupon the appellant grabbed her and pulled her
toward him. According to her, she pulled his hair and bit his face, and he then

[Page 350]

swore at her and said “I’ll fix you”, grabbed
her by the throat with one hand and started to choke her. She pleaded with him,
and finally he released his grasp upon her throat and made it plain that he
intended to have sexual intercourse with her. By that time she was terrified
and yielded in fear of further violence saying to him “I guess I have no
choice”.

When the act was completed the appellant drove
her home, stopping the car at her request at a well‑lighted intersection two
and a half blocks from her house. The complainant stated that when he stopped
the car, or shortly before he stopped it, he turned out the lights but this the
appellant denied. As she left the car, she attempted to get the number of the
license but succeeded in getting only some of the digits in it.

When the complainant entered her home her
husband, although in bed, was still awake. The husband testified, that the
complainant was sobbing, her hair was disarrayed, her dress was askew, there
were two small scratches on her chest and her throat was very red from ear to
ear. He asked her “What is the trouble?” to which she replied “I have just got
myself in a jam”. He then said “What has happened?” to which she replied “A
young chap picked me up and brought me home and he then started up in his car
quick and took me out in the outskirts of the city and I have been raped.”

The appellant, in his evidence, admitted that
the complainant had grabbed the steering wheel of the car as he was first
leaving her home. He admitted that when they arrived at the lonely spot on the
mountainside, he made it plain that he desired to have sexual intercourse with
her. He testified that at first she faintly demurred and he possibly used some
bad language toward her, but that she finally agreed and that the act took
place with her full consent and co‑operation. He denied using either
threats or violence.

There was some conflict of evidence as to what
conversation occurred between the time when the complainant said “I guess I
have no choice” and the completion of the act of intercourse. She admits having
said to the appellant “You seem to have a lot of experience”. He deposed that
he had asked her whether he should use a contraceptive

[Page 351]

and that she said “No”. The complainant was
called in reply and asked whether any conversation such as that last mentioned
took place. Her reply was “No, I don’t recall any”.

On Wednesday, October 25, according to the
complainant’s husband, instead of communicating with the police, he started out
himself to try to locate the car, part of the license number and the
description of which his wife had given him. He was unsuccessful.

On Thursday, October 26, the husband and wife
were in downtown Hamilton
together, shortly after the noon hour, and, by coincidence, the wife saw the appellant on the street
and pointed him out to her husband. Together they approached the appellant.
Some conversation took place between the husband and the appellant, during
which the latter denied ever having seen the complainant. The appellant stated,
among other things, that Police Constable Larson could account for his
whereabouts on the Tuesday night, and the husband and wife and the appellant
started for the police station. On the way, a police cruiser, in which were
Police Constable Larson and another officer, drove along and stopped, and the
husband entered into a discussion with them that resulted finally in the three
of them getting into the cruiser with the police constables to go to a parking
lot where the appellant said his father usually parked his car. In the parking
lot, the complainant identified a car as being the one in which she had been
driven and the appellant admitted it was the one he was driving on the night in
question.

The appellant was then taken in custody to the
police station. There, after a caution was administered to him, he made a
statement in which he stated where he had been and what he had been doing from
about 3.00 o’clock on the afternoon of Tuesday, October 24, until he went to bed
at his home shortly after midnight. This statement contained no reference to his meeting with the
complainant or being in her company. It was reduced to writing and signed by
the appellant.

After about two hours further interrogation by
the police, which further interrogation, according to the evidence of the
police constables, was prompted by the fact that they did not believe what the
appellant had said in his

[Page 352]

first statement, the appellant made another
statement in which he did account for his meeting with the complainant on the
street corner, their drive, first to the front of her home, and later to the
lonely spot where he had sexual intercourse with her with her consent. Both
these statements were admitted in evidence at the trial. I of course, express
no opinion as to whether or not they would be admissible at a new trial as that
question is not before us.

In August 1949 the complainant had undergone a
hysterectomy. She had recovered her normal health but testified that she could
not become pregnant.

From the above recital it at once becomes
obvious that the appellant had carnal knowledge of the complainant at the time
and place alleged by the Crown and that the only substantial question before
the jury was whether this was done either without her consent or with consent
which had been extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm.

The only portion of the charge of the learned
trial judge which is relevant to any of the three points before us is as
follows:—

There are two other principles of law
applicable to a case of this kind which I must mention to you. One is that it
is dangerous to convict in a case of this kind on the uncorroborated evidence
of the complainant. Now, when I say it is dangerous, that is what I mean. If
you are satisfied of the truth of the story of the complainant, and do not
believe the story of the accused, you may, notwithstanding corroboration or
lack of it, make your finding accordingly; but for a long time it has been
considered dangerous to convict on uncorroborated evidence. Of course, I am not
saying that in this case there is not corroboration, and I will mention what is
brought forward here as corroboration in a moment when I come to deal with the
evidence. There is corroboration as to the identity of the accused, because he
admits the carnal knowledge; there is no difficulty there; but on the question
of corroboration as to whether there was consent or not, there is evidence—it
is for you to say what weight you give to it, and if you believe it—the redness
of the neck, the scratches on the chest, the dishevelled condition of the
clothes, the sobbing of the wife when she got home, the mark or marks on her
wrist—depending, of course, gentlemen, on what you believe about it, but there
is evidence which if you believe it to be true I would think you might accept
as corroboration of her story.

One other thing: It is the duty of a woman
who has been sexually attacked, raped or attempted rape, to complain of the
offence at the first reasonable opportunity. Unless it is the first reasonable
opportunity, probably the evidence would not be admitted at all as a matter of
law, but here, if you accept the evidence, the complainant as soon as she got
home told her husband that she had been raped, and he saw the marks on her neck
and chest and I think at that time her wrist. But there is

[Page 353]

the evidence which is before you for
consideration as to whether she complained at the first reasonable opportunity
or not. The weight to be attached to it, gentlemen, is for you.

It will be convenient to deal with the grounds
of appeal in the order set out above.

As to the first point, it is a well settled rule
of practice at common law that in cases of rape while the jury may convict on
the uncorroborated evidence of the prosecutrix the judge must warn them that it
is dangerous to do so and may in his discretion advise them not to do so. In
the case at bar no exception is taken to the manner in which the learned trial
judge warned the jury of this danger. What is complained of is his failure to
explain to them what is meant by the term corroboration. In my opinion this
ground is well taken. I do not think it necessary to refer to authorities other
than the classic statement of the Court of Criminal Appeal in The King v.
Baskerville[25]:

We hold that evidence in corroboration must
be independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to
connect him with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which
implicates him, that is, which confirms in some material particular not only
the evidence that the crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner
committed it. The test applicable to determine the nature and extent of the
corroboration is thus the same whether the case falls within the rule of
practice at common law or within that class of offences for which corroboration
is required by statute. The language of the statute, “implicates the accused”,
compendiously incorporates the test applicable at common law in the rule of
practice. The nature of the corroboration will necessarily vary according to
the particular circumstances of the offence charged. It would be in high degree
dangerous to attempt to formulate the kind of evidence which would be regarded
as corroboration, except to say that corroborative evidence is evidence which
shows or tends to show that the story of the accomplice that the accused
committed the crime is true, not merely that the crime has been committed, but
that it was committed by the accused.

The corroboration need not be direct
evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely
circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime.

This decision has been repeatedly approved and
acted upon by this Court. See, for example, Hubin v. The King[26], particularly at page 444 and MacDonald
v. The King[27].

[Page 354]

In the case at bar there was no question as to
whether if a crime was committed it was committed by the appellant. The
question was whether or not a crime had been committed at all. The
corroboration to be sought was of the complainant’s testimony that she did not
consent to the act of intercourse but only submitted to it in fear of bodily
harm.

As there is to be a new trial I do not think it
desirable to discuss the evidence with a view to attempting to make a list of
those items in which it would have been open to a properly instructed jury to
find corroboration. The judge who presides at the new trial will be dealing
with the evidence then given and in my opinion should do so unhampered by
anything that has been said in the courts below with regard to any particular
item of evidence given at the first trial. It is the duty of the judge in a
case of this sort, when there is any evidence on which a jury could find
corroboration, to direct the jury as to what is necessary to constitute
corroboration and it is then for the jury to say whether corroborative
inferences should be drawn. In the case at bar to enable the jury to deal with
this question it was essential that it be made plain to them (i) that
corroboration could be found only in evidence independent of the testimony of
the complainant and of such a character that it tended to show that her story
on the vital question of consent was true, and (ii) that facts, though
independently established, could not amount to corroboration if, in the view of
the jury, they were equally consistent with the truth as with the falsity of
her story on this point. These matters were not explained to the jury.

I do not understand the reasons of Roach J.A. as
differing from the view that the jury should have been so instructed. The
learned Justice of Appeal was however of opinion that the omissions in the
charge in this regard were overcome by what the learned trial judge said to the
jury, in the passage from his charge quoted above, by way of illustration of
what might in the case at bar amount to corroboration. With respect, I am
unable to agree. I am not satisfied that the jury would understand, for
example, that the evidence of the complaint must not be regarded as

[Page 355]

corroboration, and I find nothing in what was
said which would bring home to them that evidence to be corroborative must
possess the essential quality of independence.

As to the second point, while I do not
understand the learned trial judge to have intended to charge the jury that
they might treat the evidence of the complaint as corroborative of the
complainant’s testimony, I think it was not made clear to them that they must
not so regard it. I am of opinion that in cases where a sexual offence is
charged, evidence of the making of a complaint is not corroborative of the
testimony of the complainant in the sense in which the term corroborative is
used in the passage from The King v. Baskerville quoted above. The
ground upon which evidence of the making of a complaint is admitted and the
limited purpose for which such evidence can be legitimately used are clearly
stated in The Queen v. Lillyman[28].
I refer particularly to the following passage at page 177:—

. . . The evidence is admissible only upon
the ground that it was a complaint of that which is charged against the
prisoner, and can be legitimately used only for the purpose of enabling the
jury to judge for themselves whether the conduct of the woman was consistent
with her testimony on oath given in the witness-box negativing her consent, and
affirming that the acts complained of were against her will, and in accordance
with the conduct they would expect in a truthful woman under the circumstances
detailed by her. The jury, and they only, are the persons to be satisfied
whether the woman’s conduct was so consistent or not. Without proof of her
condition, demeanour, and verbal expressions, all of which are of vital
importance in the consideration of that question, how is it possible for them
satisfactorily to determine it?

In his reasons Roach J.A. quotes the following
passage from Rex v. Osborne[29]:

. . . Within such bounds, we think the
evidence should be put before the jury, the judge being careful to inform the
jury that the statement is not evidence of the facts complained of, and must
not be regarded by them, if believed, as other than corroborative of the
complainant’s credibility, and, when consent is in issue, of the absence of
consent.

This passage is correctly explained by Hewart
L.C.J. speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Lovell[30], as follows:—

. . . It is quite true, if one looks at
particular passages in the judgment in Osborne, it might seem, as far as
mere words are concerned, as if the judgment went beyond the judgment in Lillyman.
(But that is probably

[Page 356]

not the correct view. When, for example,
the words are used, as they are at page 561 of the report, “corroborative of
the complainant’s credibility”, nothing more is really meant than what is
spoken of in Lillyman in the words: “The consistency of the conduct of
the prosecutrix with the story told by her in the witness box.”

It is to be observed that in Rex v. Osborne (supra)
the question whether the evidence of complaint was capable of being treated
as corroboration of the complainant’s testimony did not arise and was not
decided. As appears at page 553 of the report the chairman had told the jury
that the only corroboration of the girl’s story was the statement of the
prisoner at the police station.

If and in so far as the judgment of Middleton
J.A. in Rex v. Auger[31], and
particularly at page 184, decides that evidence of a complaint is
corroborative of the complainant’s testimony in the sense in which the word is
used in The King v. Baskerville or that evidence which would not serve
as corroboration in a case where corroboration is required by statute might do
so in cases falling within the rule of practice at common law, it is at
variance with the judgment in Baskerville and ought not to be followed.

I venture to think that the difficulty in
reconciling the statements in some of the decisions arises from the fact that,
in common parlance, the word “corroborate” has not a single or precise meaning.
Since the decision in Baskerville, and its approval and adoption in this
Court referred to above, it is no longer open to doubt that before evidence can
be properly described as corroborative in cases where corroboration is required
either by statute or under the rule of practice at common law it must be shewn
to possess the essential quality of independence. It must be made plain to the
jury that the witness whose testimony requires corroboration can not
corroborate herself. I do not think it necessary to multiply authorities and
will refer only to the following:—In Rex v. Evans[32], Hewart L.C.J. speaking for the Court of
Criminal Appeal said:—

It has been pointed out again and again in
these cases that evidence of a complaint by the prosecutrix is not
corroboration of her evidence against the prisoner. It entirely lacks the
essential quality of coming from an independent quarter.

[Page 357]

In Rex v. Coulthread[33], Avory J., with the concurrence of Lord
Hewart C.J. and Branson J., said at page 48:—

. . . Undoubtedly that statement that the
things which were said in the morning might be treated as corroboration of the
boy’s story is in direct conflict with the view of this Court, expressed in
more than one case, that a complaint of this sort, though it may be evidence of
the consistency of the complainant’s story is not corroboration in the proper
sense in which that word is understood in cases of this kind.

In Rex v. Whitehead[34], Lord Hewart C.J., delivering the judgment
of the Court, said at page 102:—

. . . Any such inference as to what the
girl had told her mother could not amount to corroboration of the girl’s story,
because it proceeded from the girl herself; it was merely the girl’s story at
second hand. In order that evidence may amount to corroboration it must be
extraneous to the witness who is to be corroborated.

Rex v. Whitehead was
accepted as correctly stating the law in this regard in the judgment of Bowlby
J.A. in Rex v. LeBrun[35]. The
other members of the Court of Appeal, Roach and Hogg, JJ.A., agreed with Bowlby
J.A. If and in so far as the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex
v. Calhoun[36]
expresses the view that evidence of a complaint may be treated as corroboration
of the testimony of the complainant within the meaning of the term
corroboration as explained in The King v. Baskerville it must be
regarded as over-ruled. I do not mean by this to suggest that the actual result
reached in that case was wrong.

As to the third point I am of opinion that the
learned trial judge erred in failing to charge the jury as to the limited use
that could be made of the evidence of the complaint. The importance of so doing
and of warning the jury against treating the complaint as evidence of the facts
complained of has been stressed in many cases. I will refer only to the
following passage in Regina v. Lillyman (supra) at page
178:—

It has been sometimes urged that to allow
the particulars of the complaint would be calculated to prejudice the interests
of the accused, and that the jury would be apt to treat the complaint as
evidence of the facts complained of. Of course, if it were so left to the jury
they would naturally so treat it. But it never could be legally so left; and we
think it is the duty of the judge to impress upon the jury in every case that
they are not entitled to make use of the complaint as any evidence whatever of
those facts, or for any other purpose than that we have stated.

[Page 358]

In conclusion it is necessary to consider the.
submission of counsel for the respondent that even if we should find that there
was error in law as to any or all of the grounds of appeal argued before us we
should apply the provisions of section 1014(2)  of the Criminal Code  and
dismiss the appeal. After a perusal of the complete record I find myself quite
unable to say that a reasonable jury after being properly directed would
necessarily have convicted the appellant.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and direct a new trial.

Appeal allowed; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Murder—Use of revolver subsequent to
commission of robbery—Whether accused in flight—No pursuit—Interpretation of s.
260 (d) of the Criminal Code  as enacted by S. of C. 1947, c. 55, s. 7 .

Appellant, with an accomplice, committed an
armed robbery at Windsor, and then engaged a taxi driver to drive them to
London. The latter became suspicious and went into a service station in Chatham
to phone the police, but appellant accompanied him and he was unable to do so.
He made another attempt at a service station in London and succeeded in lifting
the telephone receiver and asking for the police. Appellant, who had
accompanied him, produced a Colt revolver and ordered everyone into the
grease-pit at the rear of the station.

[Page 714]

The taxi driver escaped through a doorway
slamming a wooden door behind him. A bullet discharged from appellant’s gun
passed through the doorway killing a person whose presence was unknown to
appellant. It was contended by appellant that the gun was discharged
accidentally when he slipped on the floor, and that the trial judge was wrong
when he charged that appellant was, after leaving Windsor, fleeing from lawful
apprehension since there being no pursuer, it could not be said that he was
pursued and, therefore, in flight.

Held (Cartwright
J. dissenting), that the appeal should be dismissed as the trial judge was
justified in leaving it to the jury to find whether the accused was in flight
“upon” (meaning after) the Windsor robbery, even though there was as yet no
pursuit. It is sufficient that the pursuit be apprehended and, therefore, the
matter of the flight may be subjective so far as the offender is concerned.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario affirming appellant’s conviction for murder.

W.R. Poole for the appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. and C.C. Savage K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin,
Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by

KERWIN J.:—The appellant and one Bechard were
jointly indicted and tried on a charge that on November 20, 1950, at London,
Ontario, they murdered Clare Galbraith. Bechard was acquitted but Rowe was
convicted and his conviction was affirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeal
for Ontario. He was given leave to appeal to this Court from that affirmance on
two points of law, the first of which is:—

Did the learned trial judge err in his
charge to the jury when he stated that the appellant after leaving Windsor was fleeing
from lawful apprehension, thus bringing into operation Section 260 (d)
of the Criminal Code ?

Rowe testified that a Colt revolver (Exhibit 13)
had been taken by him from his boarding house in Detroit, Michigan, with the
permission of the landlady’s son. On November 20, 1950, Rowe and Bechard, who
had boarded at the same place, came to Windsor, Ontario. About 2 p.m. Rowe
telephoned a Mrs. Brown in Windsor, the wife of a friend, inquiring if her
husband was at home. He was advised that the husband was at work and would not
be home until 6 p.m. Rowe knew that Brown had in his possession three
automatics and a Colt pistol, and there

[Page 715]

was some discussion between Rowe and Bechard as
to securing these in order to procure funds. About 2.45 p.m. Bechard, armed
with Exhibit 13, forced Mrs. Brown into the basement where he tied and
gagged her. She heard another man moving around on the floor above, and in fact
Rowe admitted that he and Bechard stole the automatics and pistol with the
intention of selling them. After Mrs. Brown had freed herself, she found
that the telephone wires to her house had been cut.

About 3.30 p.m., John Jolly, an independent taxi
owner stationed at the Prince Edward Hotel in Windsor, about two miles distant
from the Brown home, was approached by Bechard and requested to drive Rowe and
himself to London. Jolly was told that neither man had funds but he was
promised payment upon completion of the trip.

While en route from Windsor to London, Jolly
became suspicious because of the conversation between Rowe and Bechard and
stopped at a service station at Chatham with the intention of telephoning
police. However, Rowe accompanied him and he was unable to carry out his
intention. Upon reaching London, on his own initiative, Jolly stopped at a
service station and was again accompanied by Rowe. The latter instructed Jolly
to proceed to a certain address, which, however, could not be located. By this
time Jolly had become even more alarmed and suspicious and drove into another
gasoline station. Rowe and Jolly proceeded into the office where Rowe consulted
a telephone directory and stated he had discovered the London address he
wanted. Jolly noticed that the telephone directory was opened at “Zurich”, a
municipality some distance outside of London. Jolly’s suspicion that the trip
was “not legitimate” was then confirmed and he lifted the telephone receiver
and asked the operator to get the police. Upon hearing Jolly’s request, Rowe
immediately pulled out Exhibit 13, which had been returned to him by Bechard
after the Brown robbery, and calling to those present “This is a stick up” or
“Everybody in the back”, he ordered them into the rear of the service station.
Jolly and others were herded into the grease pit room. Rowe ordered Jolly to
stop and not go on with the others. Jolly hesitated a moment and then ran
through a doorway, through a small connecting room, and through an open doorway
into the wash rack room, slamming a

[Page 716]

wooden door behind him. While Rowe was in the
grease pit room with Exhibit 13 in his hand, a bullet was discharged from it,
passing through the wooden door that Jolly had closed and killing Galbraith,
whose presence was unknown to Rowe. Rowe’s evidence was that he slipped on the
floor, thus causing the bullet to be discharged, but that he had no intention
of pulling the trigger. While there is other evidence that Rowe was seen to
pull back the hammer of the gun and that two distinct clicks accompanying the
movement were heard, the point is unimportant in view of the only problem
before us under the first question, which concerns section 260  of the Criminal
Code , and particularly the opening clause and 260(d) as enacted by
sections 6  and 7  of chapter 55 of the 1947 Statutes.

Before referring to section 260 , it should
be added that Rowe’s evidence was that he intended to proceed to Toronto to
seek a reconciliation with his wife and that Bechard also intended to go to
Toronto to commence divorce proceedings against his wife; that he (Rowe)
intended to sell the five weapons and from the proceeds give Bechard $75 and
pay Jolly $50 for his trip from Windsor to London and return, using any balance
to proceed by bus to Toronto; that he spent fifteen minutes in an unsuccessful
endeavour to locate a purchaser of the weapons in Windsor; that he proposed to
make a sale at any available pool room in London; that he hired a cab, rather
than take other means of transportation, in order to arrive in London before
the closing of the pool rooms in that city,—although he did not know at what time
the pool rooms closed; that he had passed through London previously but had
never tarried there.

Section 260  as amended in 1947 reads as
follows:—

260. In case of treason and the other
offences against the King’s authority and person mentioned in Part II, piracy
and offences deemed to be piracy, escape or rescue from prison or lawful
custody, resisting lawful apprehension, murder, rape, indecent assault,
forcible abduction, robbery, burglary or arson, culpable homicide is also
murder, whether the offender means or not death to ensue, or knows or not that
death is likely to ensue.

(a) if he means to inflict grievous
bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating the commission of any of the
offences in this section mentioned, or the flight of the offender upon the
commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues from such injury;
or

[Page 717]

(b) if he administers any
stupefying or overpowering thing for either of the purposes aforesaid, and
death ensues from the effects thereof; or

(c) if he, by any means wilfully
stops the breath of any person for either of the purposes aforesaid, and death
ensues from such stopping of the breath.

(d) if he uses or has upon
his person any weapon during or at the time of the commission or attempted
commission by him of any of the offences in this section mentioned or the
flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and
death ensues as a consequence of its use.

One of the offences mentioned in the opening
paragraph, “robbery”, had been committed by Rowe at the Brown house in Windsor.
The contention that he did not use Exhibit 13 at the London service station and
that Galbraith’s death did not ensue as a consequence of its use cannot be
sustained. Section 260 (d) was enacted as a result of the decision
in Hughes v. The King[1], and
its provisions are met in this case by the facts that Rowe not only had the
Colt upon his person but pulled it out and held it in his hand. That was a use,
under any definition of that very ordinary word, and the death of Galbraith
ensued as a consequence.

Part of the Crown’s case was that Rowe
committed, or attempted to commit, robbery at London, and the jury were charged
accordingly, but it was also put to the jury, in accordance with another
submission of the Crown, that Rowe was in flight upon the commission of the
Windsor robbery and the most serious attack was made upon those portions of the
charge to the jury dealing with that matter. In argument before us,
circumstances were imagined where it was said that there could be no flight but
it is sufficient for this appeal to decide that there was evidence upon which
the jury, to whom it was left as a matter of fact, could decide that Rowe was
in flight upon (which means after) the Windsor robbery. The time element is of
importance. About 2.45 p.m. the robbery took place; fifteen minutes, according
to Rowe, were spent in an endeavour to locate a purchaser of the weapons; about
3.30 Jolly was engaged for the trip to London, and he was never left alone by
Rowe. Rowe had only passed through London and was not familiar with the city,
although

[Page 718]

according to his story he intended to dispose of
the weapons at a pool room. It was contended that there was no evidence that
the police had ever been notified of the Windsor robbery and that, there being
no pursuer, it could not be said that Rowe was pursued and, therefore, in
flight. That contention is unsound. The whole matter was subjective so far as
Rowe was concerned. He knew that he had committed a robbery at Brown’s house;
he was anxious to dispose of the weapons taken from that house; he spent only
fifteen minutes endeavouring to find a purchaser in Windsor; it was Bechard who
made the arrangements with the taxi driver but it was Rowe, who had not been
seen by Mrs. Brown, who identified himself to Jolly when the latter was
raising a question as to being paid for the trip to London. Rowe never let
Jolly out of his sight, and coupled with this are the circumstances under which
he pulled out Exhibit 13. The trial judge was correct in leaving it to the jury
to find whether Rowe was in flight.

The second point upon which leave to appeal was
given is this:—

Did the learned trial judge err in allowing
the admission of Exhibit 23 as evidence in the case, and in allowing also all
other evidence in connection with the crime committed in Windsor?

At the trial, a very short extract from a
statement previously made by Bechard was put in evidence as against him by the
Crown in order to show his connection with Exhibit 13. Later, at the
instigation of Bechard’s counsel, the whole of the statement was admitted as
Exhibit 23 but it was made clear to the jury that the extract and the entire
statement were evidence only against Bechard and not as against Rowe. The trial
judge having ruled that Bechard’s statement was voluntary and having permitted
Crown counsel to put in as evidence the short extract referred to, it was quite
proper that the judge should later permit the whole of the statement to be
admitted at the request of counsel for Bechard. The latter was one of the
accused and was entitled to have the whole of the statement go in so that the
jury might have before it everything that had been said by him. This is not a
case where an accused seeks to put in evidence in chief a statement made

[Page 719]

by him on some previous occasion, whether to a
police officer or not, and the decisions cited in connection with that class of
case are inapplicable.

The appeal must be dismissed.

KELLOCK J.:—Put shortly, the question with
respect to which leave to appeal was granted and which remains undisposed of,
is whether or not there was any evidence of flight with respect to the robbery
in Windsor so as to render applicable s. 260(d) of the Code.

The section provides that, in the case of
certain offences including robbery, culpable homicide is also murder, whether
the offender means or not death to ensue, or knows or not that death is likely
to ensue,

(d) if he uses or has upon
his person any weapon during or at the time of the commission or attempted
commission by him of any of the offences in this section mentioned, or the
flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and
death ensues as a consequence of its use.

On behalf of the Crown it was argued that the
length of time between the commission of the crime in respect of which the
flight occurs, and the death, is immaterial if the offender in the interim is
evading arrest. On the other hand, the appellant contended that before there
can be any flight within the meaning of the paragraph, there must, at the
least, be an attempt to apprehend. In other words, it is said that flight
involves pursuit, and if there be no pursuit in fact, there can be no flight
within the meaning of this legislation.

In my opinion, neither of these contentions
ought to be accepted. As to the Crown’s contention, I think it is too wide. On
the other hand, it has been often pointed out that “the wicked flee when no man
pursueth.” One of the ordinary meanings of the word “flight” is the “action of
running away from danger,” and I think the danger (in such a case as the
present, danger of loss of liberty) may be apprehended as well as present and
actual. In other words, the subjective element in any case may be sufficient.

In The Queen v. Humphery[2], Tindal C.J. said, with relation to the use
of the word “upon” in statutes, at p. 370, that it

[Page 720]

may undoubtedly either mean before the act
done to which it relates, or simultaneous with the act done, or after the act
done, according as reason and good sense require the interpretation, with
reference to the context, and subject matter of the enactment.

The Oxford Dictionary gives as one of the
meanings of the word, “following upon” as well as “immediately after.” The
French text of the statute here in question reads

. . . ou au cours ou au
moment de la fuite du délinquant après la perpetration . . .

In the present instance, “upon” cannot be given
the meaning of either before or simultaneously with the commission of the
offence, and as the word “immediately” is not used in the statute, I think
“upon” should be interpreted in the sense of “following.” The question as to
whether or not in a given case flight exists is, of course, a question of fact.

In the case at bar, I think the circumstances,
which I do not repeat, are sufficient to have enabled the jury, if they saw
fit, to find that the appellant, at the time the fatal shot was fired, was in
flight upon the commission of the Windsor robbery within the meaning of the
statute. The fact that the jury might also have concluded that he and his
companion had a new venture in mind involving the sale of the guns or their use
in another way to obtain money, did not preclude the jury from taking such a
view.

In these circumstances, I would dismiss the
appeal. I should like to add that, in my view, we are indebted to
Mr. Poole for his argument in this case, and the way in which all
difficulties were frankly faced.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This is an appeal,
pursuant to leave granted by my brother Taschereau, from a unanimous judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on February 22, 1951, affirming
the conviction of the appellant on a charge of murdering one Clare Galbraiith.

The relevant facts are stated, and
section 260  of the Criminal Code  is set out, in the judgment of my
brother Kerwin and it is not necessary to repeat them.

[Page 721]

I find it necessary to consider only the first
point upon which leave to appeal was granted which was as follows:—

First, did the learned trial judge err in
his charge to the jury when he stated that the appellant after leaving Windsor
was fleeing from lawful apprehension, thus bringing into operation
section 260 (d) of the Criminal Code ?

On the evidence it was open to the jury to find
(i) that the discharge of the revolver which killed Galbraith was accidental,
in the sense that it was not discharged by any act of Rowe’s done with the
intention of discharging it but resulted from his slipping on the floor of the
grease-pit room, and (ii) that in the service station at London, where
Galbraith was shot, Rowe was neither committing nor attempting to commit any of
the offences mentioned in section 260  of the Criminal Code . If the jury
did find the facts to be as set out in (i) and (ii) then what moved them to convict
Rowe of murder instead of manslaughter must, I think, have been a finding that
he was using the revolver during or at the time of his flight upon the
commission of the robbery in which he had taken part in Windsor.

On a careful reading of the whole charge I think
it clear that the learned trial judge instructed the jury that it was open to
them to find that at the moment of the discharge of the revolver the appellant
was in flight from the commission of the robbery in Windsor and that if they
did so find then as a matter of law, even if they concluded that the discharge
of the revolver was accidental in the sense above mentioned, it was their duty
to convict the appellant of murder rather than manslaughter. I refer
particularly to the following passages in the charge of the learned trial
judge:

Now, does that indicate to you that these
men were still in flight from Windsor, that they were getting away from the
police following that robbery in Windsor? It is for you to say, gentlemen of
the jury, whether they were in flight or not, because if they were in flight
from the robbery, if their flight had not been discontinued, if there had not
been a termination of it, then they come right within that amendment of the
Code which I gave to you a few minutes ago.

* *
*

You have to look at it this way, that in
the case of manslaughter the unlawful act must not be such as the offender knew
or ought to have known was likely to cause death. It must not be any of the
acts I have described as murder. Therefore, if you find that Rowe did not mean
to cause death, or if you have a reasonable doubt about it, or if you

[Page 722]

find he did not mean to cause to the person
killed bodily injury which he knew was likely to cause death and that he was
reckless as to whether death ensued or not, and if you find he did not mean to
cause death or bodily injury to Jolly or knew that he was likely to cause death
to Jolly, and in addition to that, if you find there was no flight, and
if you find there was no attempted robbery, or if you have a reasonable doubt
about these things, and you merely find he was pointing that gun and while he
was pointing the gun it went off by accident, you would be justified in
bringing in a verdict against Rowe of manslaughter, but you have to eliminate
all these things that are murder. If you merely find he was not robbing or
fleeing from lawful apprehension, that he was merely pointing a gun and the gun
went off by accident, as he says, then he would be only guilty of manslaughter.
If he has even raised a reasonable doubt in your mind about these items of
murder, you would be entitled to make such a finding.

I say, as I told you this afternoon, if
you say that they were not, when they got to London, escaping from lawful
apprehension, if you can say they were not attempting a robbery, if you can
say that he shot at Jolly without intending to cause any fatal harm, then you
get down to where he was committing an offence, and did not intend to cause
death, then you are in the realm of manslaughter. But before you are in the
realm of manslaughter you must be able to get rid of the crime of flight and
of robbery in London, and the attempt to cause bodily injury to Jolly, which
was likely to cause death.

* *
*

All I want to emphasize to you, gentlemen
of the jury, is that before you get to manslaughter at all in this case you
have to eliminate all those items which would be murder.

There is no evidence in the record that at the
time of the discharge of the revolver the police in Windsor or anywhere else,
or indeed anyone other than Rowe and his accomplice Bechard, knew that the
appellant had taken part in the robbery in Windsor. Mrs. Brown, the victim
of the robbery, had not seen Rowe and there is no evidence that she had any
idea of the identity of Bechard. She had seen Bechard during the robbery and
was able to identify him some days later in a police line-up but prior to the
robbery he was a stranger to her. There is no evidence that any pursuit of Rowe
and Bechard as a result of the robbery at Windsor ever commenced.

It seems to me that the question which we have
to decide is whether, in this state of the evidence, as a matter of law on a
proper construction of section 260  of the Criminal Code  it was open
to the jury to find that the discharge of the revolver occurred during or at
the time of the flight

[Page 723]

of Rowe upon the commission of the robbery in
Windsor, within the meaning of those words as used in clause (d) of
the section.

It is, I think, of assistance to consider the
state of the law immediately prior to the amendment. The common law is, I
think, correctly stated in the following passage in Archbold’s Criminal
Pleading, 32nd Edition (1949) page 910:—

If a person, while in the act of committing
a felony involving violence, e.g., rape, kills another without having the
intention of so doing, the killing is murder. A person who uses violent
measures in the commission of a felony involving personal violence does so at
his own risk and is guilty of murder if those measures result, even
inadvertently, in the death of the victim. For this purpose, the use of a
loaded firearm in order to frighten the victim into submission is a violent
measure. If the act is unlawful but does not amount to felony, the killing,
generally speaking, is manslaughter.

The common law in this regard was carried in a
somewhat modified form into section 260  of the Criminal Code  as it
read prior to the 1947 amendment. For felonies involving violence Parliament
substituted the offences enumerated in the opening words of the
section and, where the offender neither meant death to ensue nor knew that
it was likely to ensue as a result of his conduct, required as a condition of
his conviction of murder proof either of the intention to inflict grievous
bodily harm or of the administration of a stupefying or overpowering thing or
of the stopping of the breath of a person, for the purpose, in each case, of
facilitating the commission of one of the specified offences or the flight of
the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof.

In this state of the law The King v. Hughes[3] was decided, the unanimous judgment of this
court being delivered by Sir Lyman Duff, C.J.C. We are, of course, bound by
that judgment except in so far as its effect may have been abrogated or
modified by the amendment referred to. It appears to me to have decided that
when an accused, who is in the course of committing a robbery accompanied by
violence, is using a pistol and such pistol is discharged during a struggle and
the death of another person is caused thereby and there is some evidence that
such discharge was accidental, the trial judge must instruct the jury that

[Page 724]

if they reach the conclusion that the pistol
went off by accident—in the sense that it was not discharged by any act of the
accused done with the intention of discharging it—(or are not satisfied that it
did not go off in that manner) they should find a verdict of manslaughter
unless they are satisfied that the conduct of the accused was such that he knew
or ought to have known it to be likely to induce such a struggle as occurred
and that somebody’s death was likely to be caused thereby and that such was the
actual effect of his conduct and of the struggle.

By the 1947 amendment the following further
alternative condition was added to section 260 :—

(d) if he uses or has upon his
person any weapon during or at the time of the commission or attempted
commission by him of any of the offences in this section mentioned or the
flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted commission thereof, and
death ensues as a consequence of its use.

I find myself in respectful agreement with the
argument of Mr. Common that the amendment does make a change in the law as
laid down in The King v. Hughes, with the result that now if an offender
during or at the time of the commission of one of the offences mentioned or
during or at the time of his flight upon the commission or attempted commission
thereof is using a revolver and death ensues as a consequence of its use this
will be murder even although the actual discharge of such revolver was
accidental in the sense above mentioned. It remains to consider the meaning of
the words “flight upon the commission of the offence.” Counsel were not able to
refer us to any reported case dealing with the interpretation of these words.

Mr. Common, while submitting that in the
case at bar he does not need to press his argument so far, contends that the
flight of the offender, within the meaning of the section continues so
long as he is apprehensive of and seeking to evade arrest. The difficulty in
accepting this is that to do so would bring about the result that once a person
had committeed one of the offences mentioned in section 260  he would,
within the meaning of clause (d) of that section continue to
be in flight until he was apprehended and would therefore be guilty of murder
if anyone was killed by the accidental discharge of a pistol which he was using
for any purpose.

[Page 725]

Mr. Poole contends that the word “flight”,
as used in the section, pre-supposes the existence not only of a person who is
fleeing but also of a pursuer and that a “flight upon the commission of an
offence” cannot still be in progress hours after such commission when there has
been no pursuit at all.

The effect of the amendment is, in circumstances
to which it is applicable, to render a person guilty of murder who would not
otherwise have been guilty of that crime and any doubt as to its meaning which
remains after the application of the rules of construction must be resolved in
favorem vitae.

In construing the section, I think it should be
borne in mind that a person who has committed a crime is usually apprehended,
if apprehended at all, in one of two ways; either (a) at or near
the scene of the crime or as the result of a pursuit, long or short, commencing
as he leaves the scene of the crime or (b) having escaped from the scene
of the crime, being neither interrupted during its commission nor freshly
pursued after its commission, he is later apprehended as the result of police
investigation and detective work. It seems to me that the words “the flight of
the offender upon the commission” as used in clause (d) are apt to
describe the situation suggested in (a) above, to the exclusion of that
suggested in (b). I can find no logical stopping place between so
holding and accepting the argument of counsel for the Crown which is put in the
following way in his factum:—

It is further submitted that in the
circumstances of this case having regard to the nature of the armed robbery at
Windsor that “flight of the offender” continued during the freedom of the
offender while evading arrest and terminated upon his apprehension. The length
of time between the crime and apprehension is immaterial if the offender is
evading arrest thus escaping from lawful apprehension. To this extent evading
arrest, and escaping lawful apprehension are synonymous.

I do not think that the words—“during or at the
time of . . . the flight of the offender upon the
commission of an offence”—are synonymous with the words—“so long as an offender
is a fugitive from justice”; nor do I think that flight within the meaning of
the section continues so long as fear of apprehension lingers in the mind
of the offender.

[Page 726]

I do not think it necessary to decide whether
the existence of a pursuit is in all cases a necessary condition of the
existence of a flight; but for an offender’s conduct to fall within the meaning
of that word as used in clause (d) after he has got well away from the
scene of the crime I think it necessary that there be in progress a pursuit
continuing from such scene. A flight from a pursuit commenced later as a result
of the offender being traced or identified by detective work would not, in my
opinion, be a flight upon the commission of the offence but rather a flight
from such fresh pursuit or the danger thereof. Among the meanings given to the
word “upon” in the Oxford Dictionary are “following upon”, “immediately after.”
It is in this sense that I think the word is used in section 260 (d).

I have reached the conclusion that there was no
evidence in the case at bar on which it could be held that at the time of the
fatal discharge of the revolver the appellant was in flight upon the commission
of the robbery in which he had taken part in Windsor. No pursuit of the
appellant was in progress. None had commenced. He was separated by more than
100 miles in distance and by some hours in time from the scene and moment of
the Windsor robbery. He and his accomplice had made good their escape from the
vicinity of the scene of the crime. Thereafter they had spent a short time in
Windsor endeavouring to dispose of the proceeds of the robbery and, failing in
this, they had negotiated with the taxi driver, Jolly, to drive them as far as
London where they hoped to dispose of such proceeds for enough money to enable
them to pay the taxi fare and to continue their journey to Toronto where for
varying reasons each of them wished to visit his wife. If my opinion as to the
proper construction of the section, set out above, is correct, it is clear that
under these circumstances the appellant in the service station at London was
not in flight upon the commission of the robbery at Windsor. Indeed if I
understand the theory of the Crown, in so far as it relates to flight from
Windsor rather than to attempted robbery at London, it is that the appelant
drew his revolver in the London service station not because he had any thought
that a pursuit from Windsor was in progress but rather because he feared that
if the police came in answer to Jolly’s summons they would find him in
possession of

[Page 727]

stolen goods. Had the appellant turned to flee
at the moment of Jolly’s call to the police he could not in my opinion be said
to be fleeing upon the commission of the robbery in Windsor but only from the
London police because he feared that they would find evidence which would
ultimately lead to his apprehension for that crime.

If it is suggested that the construction, which
I have indicated above to be, in my opinion, the correct one, brings about too
lenient a result, it must be remembered that we are concerned with arriving at
the intention of Parliament in a case where ex hypothesi the appellant
not only had no intention of harming anyone but had no intention of discharging
the revolver at all and that the question is not whether he ought on such
hypothesis to be acquitted but whether he must as a matter of law be convicted
of murder to the exclusion of manslaughter.

For the above reasons it is my respectful
opinion that the learned trial judge erred in law in directing the jury that
there was evidence on which they could find that the revolver was discharged
during the appellant’s flight upon the commission of the robbery in Windsor,
within the meaning of section 260 (d) of the Criminal Code  and
that if they so found they must convict him of murder. I think it impossible to
say that but for this direction the jury must necessarily have found the same
verdict.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and direct a new trial.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OP ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION

Criminal law—Abortion—Appeal by Crown from
acquittal—Statement by accused rejected by trial judge—Onus of Crown not
discharged—Criminal Code  ss. 303 , 1023(3) .

Respondent was acquitted of having unlawfully used instruments
with intent to procure a miscarriage when the trial judge refused to admit in
evidence a statement made by respondent on the ground that he was not satisfied
that it was freely and voluntarily made.

Two police officers, who were friendly with the accused, were
sent out to obtain information from him. After meeting him and having coffee
with him, they asked him to come to the barracks relative to a personal matter.
He agreed. There they told him that the girl was in a serious condition and
that in all probability serious charges would arise out of it against him. He
was then given the usual warning and the statement was elicited by detailed
questions, a form suggested by the accused.

The Crown appealed, but the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta affirmed the rejection of the statement.

Held, affirming the judgment appealed from (Estey J.
dissenting), that there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could
properly find that the Crown had not shown affirmatively that the statement had
been given voluntarily, without inducement, and that, in the determination of
that question, the trial judge had not misdirected himself.

APPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of the Supreme
Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, confirming, O'Connor C.J.A. and Parlee
J.A. dissenting, the acquittal of respondent on a charge of abortion.

H. J. Wilson K.C. for the appellant.

A. Macdonald K.C. and G. J. Gorman for the
respondent.

Kerwin J.:—Assuming
that we have jurisdiction, I have come to the conclusion that there was
evidence before Shepherd J. upon which he could find that the Crown had not
shown affirmatively that the confession of the appellant was voluntary in the
sense that it was made without inducement.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 802]

The judgment of Rand and Locke JJ. was delivered by

Rand J.:—The
case of Rex v. Boudreau 2, has laid down the rule to be applied in
the case of confessions: was the statement freely and voluntarily made. That
means, I think, was it made by one whose mind and will were disposed to the
making of it free from any real influence exerted upon them by any direct or
indirect inducement of hope or fear held out by a person in authority. We have
not complicated that by consideration of the relative weights of the inducement
and its alternatives in producing a false as distinguished from a truthful
admission.

The only question in the appeal is whether Shepherd J. had
evidence before him on which he could properly find that the Crown had not
shown affirmatively that the mind and will of the accused were so free and
whether, in any manner, in his determination of the question, he misdirected
himself. The significant circumstances are these: the police officers, advised
that the young woman was in the hospital and in a serious condition and that
the accused was suspected of being responsible, had been sent out to obtain
whatever information they could from him. They approached him under the cloak
of an admitted familiar acquaintance; they had coffee with him and tossed a coin
to see who would pay for it; the opening question at their quarters was,
""Do you know that your girl friend, Betty, is in the hospital in a serious
condition"", followed by ""in all probability serious charges will
arise out of it against you""; the statement was elicited by detailed
questions, a form suggested by the accused. These to me furnish ample matter,
first, from which to draw the inference that there was an indirect inducement,
and, secondly, that its effect had not been removed by the formal warning.
Since the officers were out to obtain information from him, what other possible
object could the reference to the likelihood of charges have had than to exert
upon him a coercive pressure to disclose what he knew? And how can it be said
that he might not take that to imply that it would be better for him to do so?
To suggest that it was a friendly warning to be circumspect or on guard would
falsify the object

[Page 803]

which they were instructed to and did pursue to the end. I
think the trial judge could properly have made the finding he did. Although the
word ""discretion"" is used in some of the cases, I am unable to see
the appropriateness of the term to that finding: but having sufficient facts
before him and not misdirecting himself as to the requirements of the rule, his
finding ought not to be interfered with. I would dismiss the appeal.

Estey J.
(dissenting):—This is an appeal on behalf of the Attorney-General of Alberta,
under sec. 1023(3)  of the Criminal Code , from a majority judgment of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 3 affirming
the dismissal of a charge preferred under sec. 303  of the Criminal Code .

In the course of the trial, when counsel for the Crown
tendered a statement made by the accused, the trial judge, in the absence of
the jury, heard evidence of the circumstances under which that statement had
been obtained. At the conclusion of this ""trial within a trial"" he
held that he was not satisfied that the statement had been voluntarily made
within the meaning of the law. Counsel for the Crown at once intimated that
apart from the contents of the statement the evidence did not justify his
proceeding. The learned trial judge accordingly directed the jury to return a
verdict of not guilty. This the jury did and the charge was dismissed.

In the course of the police investigation a sergeant
directed two constables, Sargent and Thompson, to interview the accused, with
whom they were acquainted. They met him about mid-afternoon and asked him to
come to the barracks relative to a personal matter. He agreed. They all three
had coffee at a corner café and then proceeded to the barracks at the Court
House. There they went into the Court Room and for the first time this matter
was discussed. Thompson said to the accused:

""Freddie, did you know that your girl friend Betty was
in the hospital?""

and upon his replying that he did not Thompson said:

""Well, she is in the hospital and she is in serious
condition"", and that there were serious charges likely to arise from her
condition, charges against him because of her condition.

[Page 804]

Thompson then gave the usual warning and continued:

I explained it to him a little more simpler. I told him that
he didn't have to say anything if he didn't wish to and that there was nothing
that myself or Constable Sargent could do or say to him that could influence
him or make him make any statement or make him say anything if he didn't wish
to do so, and I asked him if he understood the meaning of the warning and he
replied that he did fully. Following this we sat for a moment or two, none of
us saying anything, and the accused had his head bowed and after a moment or
two he looked up and he said, ""I didn't want to do it, she is the one who
wanted it done.""

Nothing was then said for another moment or two when
Thompson said:

""Fred, how long have you been going with Betty?""

to which the accused replied:

""One year now and six months before.""

Then, after a further short silence, Thompson asked:

""Where did you get the stuff, Fred?"", and he
replied, ""At the Sterling Drug Store.""

Then Thompson said:

""Well, do you wish, would you like to make a statement
covering this business, Fred?""

The accused paused for a moment and said:

""Yes, I might as well.""

The accused then said he did not know how to begin, or words
to that effect, and Thompson said:

""Well, in that ease I might be able to ask you
questions to help you to make your statement.""

Thompson says he again told him that the

statement must be purely voluntary and in your own words and
must be taken down as such, that I didn't want to ask him any questions that
might lead him to, if I asked him any questions it would be in such a way it
might help him to make his statement.

The constable then proceeded to ask questions and to put
these and the answers in writing. When the statement was completed the accused
read it through. He was asked if there were any mistakes or errors he desired
to correct and, upon his reply that everything seemed all right, he was asked
to, and did sign it.

The constables took the statement to the sergeant who had
detailed them to make the investigation. While there Thompson was advised that
the accused, who had remained in the Court Room, desired to see him. Thompson
returned

[Page 805]

at once to the Court Room, where the accused expressed the desire
to, and did dictate another paragraph, which he read over and signed. Thompson
then returned to the sergeant's office, where the matter was discussed and a
decision arrived at to lay a charge against the accused contrary to sec. 303 .

The statement was not marked as an exhibit, nor was it read
by the learned trial judge, and was, of course, neither before the Appellate
Division nor this Court.

At the conclusion of this evidence the learned trial judge
stated:

One thing that worries me here, Mr. Moyer (counsel for the
accused), is the statement to the accused by Thompson that serious charges are
going to be laid against you, are likely to be laid against you arising out of
what has happened to this woman … Well, is it an inducement or a threat? Aside from
that, Mr. Moyer, I can't see anything to keep this statement out.

The argument continued, in which both counsel for the Crown
and the accused took part, at the conclusion of which the learned trial judge
stated, in part, as follows:

No, viewing this thing as widely as I can, giving it serious
consideration, Mr. Read, you have not convinced me that this confession was
gotten out of this Accused freely and voluntarily on the grounds that we have
been discussing, in particular the statement of the Police Officer to him,
""Serious charges are likely to be laid against him arising out of what has
happened to this young woman,"" that coupled with the method in which the
information contained in that statement was elicited, that is by questioning
him. I appreciate these things do present difficulties, but they must be solved
in favour of an Accused where the Court is in doubt, and I do feel very much in
doubt, and I must resolve it in his favour, I would not for a moment suggest
any censure of the Police Officers, none whatever, but I think the method they
undertook was in error.

In the Appellate Division the rejection of this statement in
evidence was affirmed by a majority of the learned judges. Mr. Justice Parlee,
with whom Chief Justice O'Connor agreed, dissented and was of the opinion the
learned trial judge should have received the statement and would have directed
a new trial.

The appeal to this Court, being under sec. 1023(3)  of the Criminal
Code , is restricted to a question of law upon which there has been a
dissent in the Appellate Court. Steinberg v. The King 4;
Rex v. Décary 5.

Mr. Macdonald, counsel for the accused, contends that
whether a statement is voluntary within the meaning of

[Page 806]

the law is a question of fact or the exercise of a
discretion upon the part of the trial judge and, therefore, cannot be raised as
a question of law under sec. 1023(3) . Mr. Wilson, on behalf of the
Attorney-General, contends that it is a question of law and properly raised
within the meaning of that section.

A confession or statement which may tend to prove the guilt
of an accused party is admissible in evidence if it be affirmatively proved by
the Crown that it was made voluntarily in the sense that it was not obtained by
fear of consequence or hope of benefit held out by one in authority.

When such a statement is tendered in evidence at a trial the
judge will at once hear the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the
making of the confession as tendered by both parties. If it be a jury trial,
this trial within a trial will be conducted in the absence of the jury. The
judge must be there satisfied that the Crown has, by the evidence adduced,
affirmatively proved that the statement, having regard to all of the
circumstances, was voluntarily made. If so satisfied, he will find as a fact
that the statement was voluntarily made and admit it as evidence; if not, he
will reject it. His conclusion may often depend upon which of the witnesses he
believes, upon weighing the evidence and construing both oral and written statements.
It cannot be said to be a question of law, but rather a question of fact or of
mixed law and fact.

In The Queen v. Thompson 6, Cave J.
states the question that has been so often judicially approved:

Is it proved affirmatively that the confession was free and
voluntary—that is, was it preceded by any inducement to make a statement held
out by a person in authority? If so, and the inducement has not clearly been
removed before the statement was made, evidence of the statement is
inadmissible.

That was a decision under the Crown Cases Act 1848 (11
& 12 Vict., c. 28) where a case could be reserved upon ""any question
of law which shall have arisen on the trial."" The evidence adduced before
the magistrates did not remove the possibility that the inducement or threat
made by a party in authority to a brother and brother-in-law of the accused

[Page 807]

had not been communicated to him and, therefore, as stated
by Cave J. on behalf of the Court at p. 18:

… it is the duty of the prosecution to prove, in case of
doubt, that the prisoner's statement was free and voluntary, and that they did
not discharge themselves of this obligation.

In Ibrahim v. Rex 7, Lord
Sumner stated at p. 610:

With Reg. v. Thompson ((1893 2 Q.B.D. 12)
before him, the learned judge must be taken to have been satisfied with the
prosecution's evidence that the prisoner's statement was not so induced either
by hope or fear, and, as is laid down in the same case, the decision of this
question, albeit one of fact, rests with the trial judge.

Lord Sumner dealt with the question asked in the Ibrahim case
and construed it, though in form a question, to be, in effect,
""indistinguishable from an exclamation of dismay on the part of a humane
officer."" No misdirection was found and the reception of the statement was
affirmed.

Prosko v. The King 8, was an
appeal under sec. 1023. This Court, though a question was asked, affirmed the
decision of the trial judge that the statement received in evidence was
voluntary.

Sankey v. The King 9, was also
an appeal under sec. 1023. Five grounds of appeal, based upon the dissenting
opinion of the Appellate Court, were considered in argument. Under one of these
it was contended that the statement given to the police by the accused was not
voluntarily made and was improperly received at the trial. The appeal was in
fact disposed of and a new trial granted upon one of the other grounds, but
Chief Justice Anglin, in delivering the judgment of the Court, continued at p.
440:

We feel, however, that we should not part from this case
without expressing our view that the proof of the voluntary character of the
accused's statement to the police, which was put in evidence against him, is
most unsatisfactory.… With all the facts before him, the learned judge should
form his own opinion that the tendered statement was indeed free and voluntary
as the basis for its admission, rather than accept the mere opinion of the
police officer, who had obtained it, that it was made ""voluntarily and
freely.""

In Gach v. The King 10, also an
appeal under sec. 1023, the magistrate had received the admission in evidence
and this was affirmed by a majority of the Appellate Court in Manitoba. In this
Court it was held that the evidence did not affirmatively prove the statement
was voluntary. Mr.

[Page 808]

Justice Kerwin, with whom the Chief Justice agreed, was of
the opinion that a threat had been made and that the evidence did not
affirmatively prove that the statement had been made before the words
constituting the threat, while the majority stressed, in the particular
circumstances, the absence of any caution or warning.

In Boudreau v. The King 11, again
an appeal under sec. 1023, the majority of this Court were of the opinion that
the learned trial judge had not misdirected himself, as suggested by the
dissenting opinion in the Appellate Court of Quebec, and, therefore, affirmed
his reception of the statements as voluntarily made.

In The King v. Bellos 12, the
Appellate Court held the statements of the accused, following questions by the
police, had been improperly received in evidence at the trial. Leave to appeal
was granted under sec. 1024(2) (later 1025). This Court reversed the Appellate
Court, holding that the Crown had discharged its burden of establishing the
voluntary character of the statements made by the accused. Chief Justice
Anglin, speaking for the Court, stated at p. 261:

The mere asking of a question by the officer subsequently,
or his directing the accused's attention to the subject of one of such
statements, did not amount to an inducement or persuasion such as would render
the statements inadmissible.

In Thiffault v. The King 13, special
leave to appeal was obtained under sec. 1025  of the Criminal Code . The
Appellate Court in Quebec had held that the decision upon the admissibility of a
statement taken from an accused party in answer to questions was a matter of
discretion for the trial judge. This Court held that it was not a matter of
discretion and, following the Sankey case supra, held that the evidence did not
establish the statement had been voluntarily made.

In the foregoing cases, the failure of the trial judge to
direct himself as to the burden that rests upon the Crown and its duty to call
all available witnesses who were present at the making of the confession, as in
The Queen v. Thompson, Sankey v. The King and Thiffault
v. The King, constitutes a misdirection in law. Also, when the trial
judge has directed himself that the absence of caution or warning,

[Page 809]

as in Gach v. The King, or the mere asking of
questions, as in Bellos v. The King, of necessity excludes the
statement, he has misdirected himself in law. On the other hand, where there
was no misdirection and there was evidence to support the finding of fact, as
in Prosko v. The King and Boudreau v. The King, this
Court approved the judgment of the trial judge.

There is a difference of judicial opinion expressed in the
Provincial Courts, but, when examined, the weight of authority supports the
view that whether a statement is voluntary or not is a question of fact, or of
mixed law and fact.

The Crown was first given the right of appeal to the
Provincial Appellate Courts in 1930 by an amendment to sec. 1013 (20 & 21
Geo. V., c. 11, sec. 28). In Rex v. Rasmussen 14, the
Crown exercised its right to appeal upon a ""question of law alone,""
contending, inter alia, that the trial judge had improperly rejected two
written statements or confessions made by the accused. The decision there
turned upon the meaning of the reasons given by the trial judge in rejecting
the statement. The majority, in construing these reasons, held that the learned
trial judge had found the statement to be freely and voluntarily made. In part
these reasons read:

… I have the feeling that the statement … was obtained
freely and voluntarily, but considering all the surrounding circumstances I
don't feel that it convinces me to that degree of certainty which I think the
law requires.

The trial judge detailed these circumstances and the
majority in the Court of Appeal held that the evidence of these circumstances
did not justify his rejecting the statement. Baxter J. (later C.J.) stated at
p. 240:

… the learned trial Judge was in error in thinking that
there were rules of law which precluded him from giving effect to the
conclusion of fact at which he had arrived, viz., that the statement was made
freely and voluntarily.

Barry C.J.K.B. found a disagreement in his reasons as stated
at the trial, and as stated in his certificate under sec. 1020  of the Criminal
Code , and would have ordered a new trial on that ground. The construction
of the learned trial

[Page 810]

judge's reasons and whether there was any evidence to
justify them and the construction of his certificate all raised questions of
law.

The same Appellate Court in Rex v. Robichaud 15,
in a judgment of the Court written by Baxter C.J., affirmed the admission of a
statement made by the accused at the trial. At p. 372 it was stated:

Whether it was voluntary or not was a question of fact for
him (trial judge) and for him alone.… While agreeing with his action, I would
not be at liberty, if I thought otherwise, to overrule it as no principle of
law has been violated.

Counsel for the Crown particularly referred to The King v.
Lai Ping 16, where an application for leave to
appeal from a conviction, on the basis, inter alia, that the confession of the
accused was improperly admitted into evidence, was refused, and where Chief
Justice Hunter stated, at p. 471:

… whether the trial Judge was right in coming to the
conclusion that the confession was voluntary, is a question of law and can be
reserved as such.

He went on to find that the magistrate was right in
admitting the confession and refused leave to appeal. In the same case Duff J.
(then a member of the British Columbia Court and later Chief Justice of this
Court) stated at p. 473:

… if the decision of the preliminary question turned upon
conflicting statements of fact made by witnesses, I should have thought it was
fairly clear that the correctness of such a decision could not be raised on a
question of law. I certainly find some difficulty, myself, in stating a case
arising upon such a decision in the form of a question of law.

This was a decision to the effect that, as no error in law
was found, the conclusion at trial should be affirmed and leave to appeal refused.

Counsel also referred to Rex v. Baschuk 17.
In that case the Appellate Court in Manitoba, in effect, held that the trial
judge had misdirected himself in refusing to hear evidence on the part of the
accused that the statement was not voluntary. Dennistoun J.A., in delivering
the judgment of the Court, stated at p. 209:

The admissibility of the statement was à question of law and
was for the Judge alone.

[Page 811]

and cited Ibrahim v. The King, supra. The
Court in the Baschuk case was clearly dealing with a question of law
and, therefore, the statement just quoted must be read in that relation.

Counsel also cited Rex v. Weighill 18.
The Appellate Court in British Columbia affirmed the reception in evidence of a
confession. Mr. Justice O'Halloran, with whom Mr. Justice Robertson agreed,
stated at p. 563:

Under these circumstances the learned Judge, after what is
not questioned was a proper ""trial within a trial,"" came to the
conclusion that the prosecution had affirmatively proven that the confession was
voluntary and admitted it in evidence.

Later in the same case the learned judge stated, at p. 564:

The appeal was framed as one of law only. But upon it being
pointed out that, while the admission or rejection of a confession is
undoubtedly a question of law, nevertheless, the supporting findings of fact
and the legitimate inferences therefrom may be questions of fact or of mixed
law and fact.… Counsel for the appellant moved and was granted leave to appeal
against those findings of fact or mixed law and fact.

This paragraph illustrates the difficulties involved in this
question and, with respect, I think the preferable view is that whether the
statement in question is voluntary is a question of fact, or of mixed law and
fact, dependent upon a conclusion which involves an appreciation of all the
circumstances, including determination of credibility, a weighing of evidence,
and construction of oral statements and written documents. The position, as
stated by Turgeon J.A., is not unusual:

The learned Chief Justice was justified, taking into
consideration the numerous warnings the accused had already received and
listening to his own evidence and observing him, in concluding that he did not
make his statement under a promise or a threat of such a nature as to render
his action involuntary.

Rex v. Bahrey 19.

In Rex v. McLaren 20, the
Appellate Court of Alberta affirmed the reception in evidence of a confession
made by the accused on which the case for the prosecution upon a charge of
murder largely rested. Harvey C.J.A., writing the judgment of the Court, stated
at p. 300:

The trial Judge accepted the evidence of the policemen and I
can see no ground for questioning the correctness of his finding that the
confession was voluntary and therefore admissible.

[Page 812]

and later, in dealing with a somewhat similar point, he
stated at p. 302:

Unless a confession is voluntary when made to one in
authority it is not admissible in evidence and for the purpose of deciding its
admissibility the trial Judge must find the fact that it is voluntary …

The weight of authority supports the conclusion that when a
trial judge finds a confession or statement has been voluntarily made by an
accused he is not determining a question of law, but rather a question of fact,
or a mixed question of law and fact. The appeal to this Court under sec. 1023
being restricted to a question of law upon which there has been a dissent in
the Court below, it follows that no appeal can be taken to this Court under
that section unless the dissent in the Appellate Court is upon a question of
law in respect of which the learned trial judge, in arriving at his conclusion,
has misdirected himself.

The appeal on behalf of the Crown in this case raises two
questions of law: (a) was the learned trial judge in error in construing
the words ""that there were serious charges likely to arise from her
condition, charges against him because of her condition;"" and (b)
was he in error in directing himself as to the effect of the questions asked in
the course of the making of the statement?

The evidence in this case, upon the trial within a trial,
was confined to that given by the policemen. It was all to the same effect and
the statement would have been admitted as voluntary by the learned trial judge
had he not construed the words spoken by constable Thompson ""that there
were serious charges likely to arise from her condition, charges against him
because of her condition"" as constituting an inducement or a threat.
However these words might under other circumstances be construed, with respect,
I cannot, in the circumstances here present, attribute such a meaning. The
policemen and the accused were at least well acquainted and, while performing
their duty in making the investigation, with commendable care they informed the
accused of his position. When the words of Constable Thompson above quoted are
read, as they must be, in association with the information which preceded and
the warning which followed, it is clear that they did but plainly indicate to
the appellant that criminal proceedings might

[Page 813]

be taken against him. That he so understood what had been
said to him is evident from his subsequent conduct, including his remarks. In
the circumstances I do not think that these words did other than inform the
accused of his position and did not constitute an inducement or a threat.

The learned judge also felt disposed to find the statement
not voluntary because it was elicited by the asking of questions. It is the
duty of the police to investigate and, so far as possible, to ascertain who has
and in what manner they have violated the criminal law. In the course of their
investigations it is necessary to ask questions, but, once it has been
determined to take criminal proceedings against a party, that party should be
advised of his position and appropriately warned. This is not a positive rule
or requirement of law, but it is a wise precaution, as all statements made by
an accused after his actual or virtual custody must be affirmatively proved to
have been voluntarily made. If, thereafter, questions are asked, the nature and
character of the questions are but additional facts to be taken into account in
determining whether or not the statements have been made voluntarily. The mere
fact that questions are asked does not of necessity exclude the confession or
statement. Sir Lyman Duff, delivering the judgment of this Court, stated at p.
515:

It results from this statement of the law that the
determination of any question raised as to the voluntary character of a
statement by the accused elicited by interrogatories administered by the police
is not a mere matter of discretion for the trial judge, as the court below
appears to have thought.

Thiffault v. The King 21; Rex v. Best 22;
Rex v. Bahrey 23; Rex v. Hanna 24.

In this case the learned trial judge did not read the
statement over and, therefore, was not in a position to pass upon the nature
and character of the questions as asked. In view of the issues raised and the
evidence given, the questions having been set out in the statement, the reading
thereof was indispensable to an adequate appreciation of their possible effect.
It may be that the questions did not

[Page 814]

in any way constitute an inducement or a threat, as in The
King v. Bellos 25, where Chief Justice Anglin, speaking
for the Court, stated:

The mere asking of a question by the officer subsequently,
or his directing the accused's attention to the subject of one of such
statements, did not amount to an inducement or persuasion such as would render
the statements inadmissible.

In these circumstances I am of the opinion that the learned
trial judge misdirected himself as to the effect of the words of Constable
Thompson and that, therefore, a new trial should be had. The learned trial
judge also misdirected himself if his view was that the mere asking of
questions precluded a finding that the statement was voluntarily made. This
issue in this case must be determined at the new trial by a reading of the
statement in relation to the other relevant evidence.

The appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

Cartwright J.—The
relevant portions of the evidence and of the reasons of the learned trial judge
for refusing to admit the statement of the accused are set out in the reasons
for judgment of my brother Estey.

I am unable to find that the learned trial judge misdirected
himself on any point of law. There is nothing in the record to suggest that he
was unmindful of the well settled rule that the statement of the appellant
should not be admitted in evidence against him unless it were shewn by the
prosecution to have been voluntary in the sense that it was not obtained from
him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage induced by a person in
authority. It appears to me that the learned trial judge, on a consideration of
the evidence as to all the circumstances surrounding the making of the
statement, was not satisfied that the burden resting upon the Crown had been
discharged.

It is not, I think, shewn that the learned trial judge
directed himself that he must, as a matter of law, exclude the statement
because prior to its making one of the officers had said to the appellant:—

""Well, she is in the hospital and she is in serious
condition,"" and that there were serious charges likely to arise from her
condition, charges against him because of her condition.

[Page 815]

nor does it appear to me that the learned trial judge
directed himself, as a matter of law, that the statement must be excluded
because it was made as a result of questions put to the accused by the police
officers. I think he treated both of these circumstances as matters to be
weighed with the rest of the evidence in reaching his final conclusion. The
majority of the Court of Appeal have concurred in the view of the learned trial
judge and I find myself quite unable to say that they were wrong. It is not
relevant to inquire whether I would necessarily have reached the same
conclusion in the first instance.

Having formed the opinion that no error on the part of the
learned trial judge has been shewn, I do not find it necessary to consider the
question, so ably debated before us, whether the alleged errors, if
established, could have been said to involve questions of law alone.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE PROVINCE OF
MANITOBA

Criminal Law—Lottery, Conducting of—Criminal Code , s.
236(1)  (c)—Offences under first and second part clause (c) distinguished—Red
River (Barrel) Derby.

Section 236  of the Criminal Code , is to the effect that
every one who does any of the things described in the section is guilty of an
indictable offence. Subsection (c) is divided into two parts. The first
part applies to a person who conducts or manages any scheme for the purpose of
determining who, or the holders of what tickets are, the winners of any
property so proposed to be disposed of. The second part applies to every person
who conducts or manages any scheme by which any person upon payment of any sum
of money shall become entitled under such scheme to receive from the person
conducting or managing such scheme a larger sum of money than the sum paid by
reason of the fact that other persons have paid any sum under such scheme.

In construing subsection (c), it must be read with the
preceding subsections and therefore the words ""so * * * disposed of""
in the first part refer to the scheme indicated in the preceding subsections,
that is, ""by some mode of chance"". The second part of subsection (c)
however, stands alone. It does not refer to chance, or to mixed skill and
chance, and the receiving of money is not subordinate to any of these elements.
The rule of ejusdem generis therefor does not apply to it.

Since in the charge, preferred under the first part of
subsection (c), there was mixed skill and chance, there was no offence,
and the appeal as to it should be allowed.

As to the charge preferred under the second part of the
subsection, the admission of the appellant that winning estimators will receive
a larger sum of money than that paid for their tickets because the non-winning
estimators have contributed to the scheme, brings it within the prohibition of
the Statute and the appeal as to it should therefore be dismissed.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba 1 which allowed an appeal by the Crown
against the dismissal by a magistrate of two charges laid against the appellant
for conducting a lottery in violation of s. 236 (1) (c) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36,

[Page 653]

as enacted by 1943–44, c. 23, s. 8. (Dysart and
Richards JJ.A., dissenting in part, would have dismissed the appeal as to the
first charge.)

W. B. Scarth for the appellant.

W. J. Johnston for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Taschereau J.—The
appellant was acquitted by Magistrate D.G. Potter in the Provincial Police
Court at Winnipeg, in Manitoba, of the two following charges under section 236 
(c) of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

First charge: That John Herbert Roe, between the
first day of March, 1948, and the eighth day of March, 1948, at the City of
Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, unlawfully did manage a certain scheme,
to wit The Canadian Tourist Club Red River (Barrel) Derby, for the purpose of
determining which holders of what tickets are the winners of certain property,
to wit money proposed to be disposed of by mode of chance, contrary to section
236  (c) of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

Second charge: That John Herbert Roe, between the
first day of March, 1948, and the eighth day of March, 1948, at the City of
Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, unlawfully did manage a scheme by which
a person upon payment of a sum of money becomes entitled, under such scheme, to
receive from the said John Herbert Roe, the person managing such scheme, a
larger sum of money than the sum paid by reason of the fact that other persons
have paid a sum of money under such scheme, contrary to section 236  (c)
of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

The learned magistrate reached the conclusion, that as the
scheme managed and conducted by The Canadian Tourist Club, of which the
appellant was the secretary, involved a certain degree of skill, there were no
offences, and he dismissed both charges.

The Court of Appeal allowed both appeals and fined the
appellant $25 on each, or in default of payment, 30 days imprisonment. On the
first charge, however, Dysart and Richards JJ. would have dismissed the appeal.
The appellant now appeals to this Court. (Criminal Code  1023 (2)).

The scheme which gave rise to the present proceedings is
fully explained in the statement filed at the trial by the appellant himself.

The appellant manages a club in Room 26, Marlborough Hotel,
in the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, which is known as The
Canadian Tourist Club

[Page 654]

Red River (Barrel) Derby. At the time the ice was to leave
the Red River, approximately on the 10th of April, 1948, an oaken barrel of 45
gallon capacity, with 300 pounds of ballast, was to be placed in the Red River
at the International Boundary at Emerson, then, carried by the river current to
Norwood Bridge in the City of Winnipeg, and during its entire route it was to
be convoyed by a party in a canoe or boat, to guard it against becoming beached
on the shore or snagged or caught in bushes or other obstacles. The exact
period of time taken by the barrel in its journey was to be recorded by the
promoters of the scheme and their engineers. Tickets were then being sold at
fifty cents each, and the purchaser of a ticket was entitled to make one
estimate as to the time the barrel would take to make its journey. Attached to
each ticket was a coupon which constituted Class ""B"" membership in
The Canadian Tourist Club for 1948, and each coupon bore a serial number
identical to the serial number on the ticket to which it was attached. This
membership entitled the member to attend Club meetings and functions and take
part therein, but did not entitle him to vote. The name and address of the
purchaser were recorded on the stub of the ticket, and the purchase price, the
sum of fifty cents, was forwarded by the particular vendor of that ticket to
the scheme headquarters in Winnipeg, the copy and ticket being retained by the
ticket purchaser. The purchaser was then at liberty to fill in on the ticket,
his estimate of the time the barrel would take to make its journey, and was
asked to forward such estimate to The Canadian Tourist Club, before 6 P.M.
April 7, 1948.

Before the charges were laid against the appellant, quite a
number of these tickets had already been sold, and it was understood that the
sale of these tickets would cease prior to the day the barrel was to be
released on its journey. After the barrel had completed its journey, and the
exact travelling time ascertained, the ticket holder who had made the closest
estimate of the time taken, was to be declared the winner, and awarded first
prize, the next nearest second prize, and so on as set out on the back of the
ticket. It was also admitted by Mr. Roe that the winners would receive from the
scheme, a larger sum of

[Page 655]

money than that paid for their tickets, by reason of the
fact that other non-winning ticket holders contributed to the scheme.

Dealing with the first charge, there can be no doubt, I
think, that there is an element of chance in determining the exact period of
time that the barrel would take to cover the 105 miles, which is the
approximate distance between the International Boundary at Emerson, and Norwood
Bridge in the City of Winnipeg.

It is of course obvious that on its journey, the barrel may
wander from bank to bank of the river, depending on the wind and the current,
and it is therefore impossible to calculate in advance the exact distance which
the barrel will cover, and a participant in that scheme has therefore to resort
to guess work. But, there is also an element of skill. The evidence reveals
that with the information as to the distance of the course, namely 105 miles,
and the average speed of the current, namely 1.92 miles per hour, an
experienced Red River navigator would be in a much better position to estimate
the number of hours it would take to cover the course than one entirely
unacquainted with the Red River. A person capable of computing figures and
putting his experience into figures would have a great advantage over the
ordinary individual. Mr. Walter M. Scott, a professional engineer, testified
that a 45 gallon capacity barrel, containing 300 pounds of water would be
two-thirds full, and that if he were asked to make an estimate of the time such
a barrel would take to float down the Red River from the point already
mentioned to Norwood Bridge, he would take into consideration the distance, the
average velocity of the current, the wind effect and the effect of eddies or
cross currents. It is also his opinion and I believe it to be sound, that a Red
River navigator would have a much better chance of making a correct estimate
than one unaccustomed to the River. I believe that a man who has a reasonable
knowledge of mathematics to allow him to compute and put on paper his own
considerations, might make a reasonable estimation of the time the barrel would
take to cover the course. There is, therefore, in my opinion a mixed element of
chance and skill involved in this scheme.

[Page 656]

The first charge is based on the first part of section
236 (c) of the Criminal Code , but this section must be read with sections
236 , 236 (a) and 236 (b) and 236 (bb). Section 236  is to the
effect that every one who does any of the things described in the six
subsections of that section, is guilty of an indictable offence. Subsection
236 (a) deals with the making of any scheme for disposing of any property
* * * ""by any mode of chance"". Subsections 236 (b) and
236 (bb) deal respectively with the selling and transmitting of tickets for
any such scheme. Section 236 (c) under which the accused was
prosecuted is divided into two parts. The first part has been in the Code for many years and the second was added in 1935. The first
part applies to a person who ""conducts or manages any scheme * * * for the
purpose of determining who, or the holders of what * * * tickets * * * are the
winners of any property so proposed to be * * * disposed of"".

It is clear to me that the words ""so * * * disposed
of"" refer to the scheme indicated in the preceding subsections, that is,
""by some mode of chance"". If there is merely skill or a mixed element
of skill and chance, there is no offence.

In Rex v. Regina Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition 2
Mr. Justice Martin said at page 135:

Under sec. 236 (a) and under similar provisions
contained in early statutes in Canada dealing with similar matters, and under
the lottery Acts of England, it has been held that ""a mode of chance""
involves the absence of any skill; in other words, if it is found that skill
enters into the estimates or guesses, there cannot be a conviction under the
section.

At page 138, Mr. Justice
Martin further says:

Once it is admitted that a person of better judgment and
better powers of observation might make a closer estimate, it is at once plain
that skill plays a part, and the matter cannot be a ""mode of chance"".

The case of Bailey v. The King 3 has been
cited, but for the following reasons given by Mr. Justice Dysart 4
I do not think that it applies:

And in Bailey v. The King, 1938 SCR. 427, the
Supreme Court of Canada, confirming a decision of the Appeal Court of Ontario,
upheld a conviction of a drug store keeper for operating a ""skill puzzle
board"". The board offered prizes for all correct answers to listed
questions on obscure points of fact—which questions could have been answered
with unfailing accuracy if the player would make adequate research. The Court,
applying its ""knowledge of the usual everyday

[Page 657]

custom of mankind"", held that ""the ordinary person
entering the store would pay ""ten cents"" ""for the chance of
winning a prize, without critically examining the questions and returning later
with a correct answer or answers"" to one or more of them, and that
therefore the price was paid not for skill, but for chance, or at least for
mixed chance and skill. In that case, it is to be noted the issue was
different from the issue in the present case. There the question was whether or
not the accused was guilty under s. 986 (2) of having on his premises ""a
means or contrivance for playing any game of chance or any mixed game of chance
and skill, gaming or betting""; here the issue under s. 236 (1) (c)
is whether or not the accused was guilty of conducting a scheme, not of mixed
chance and skill, but of chance solely. By upholding that conviction, the
Supreme Court did not even pretend to say that the
""skill puzzle board"" was not a game involving some skill.

I agree with the above observations and I, therefore, come
to the conclusion that as to the first charge, the appeal should be allowed.

The second charge is laid under the second part of
subsection (c) which, as already stated, was introduced in the Code in
1935. It applies to every person who conducts or manages any scheme, by which
any person, upon payment of any sum of money, shall become entitled under such
scheme to receive from the person conducting or managing such scheme, a larger
sum of money than the sum paid, by reason of the fact that other persons
have paid any sum of money under such scheme. This part of section 236 (c)
which stands alone, does not refer to chance, or to mixed chance and skill. The
receiving of money is not subordinated to any of these elements. The larger sum
of money is paid to the winner by reason of the fact that other persons have
paid money under the scheme.

To my mind, the rule of ""ejusdem generis"" does
not apply. The admission signed by the appellant that the winning
estimators will receive a larger sum of money than that paid for their tickets,
because other non-winning estimators have contributed to the scheme, brings the
case within the prohibition of the Statute.

I would dismiss the appeal on the second charge.

Appeal allowed as to the first charge and
conviction quashed. Appeal as to second charge dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL
DIVISION.

Criminal Law—Accused charged with manslaughter arising
out of operation of motor vehicle—Trial judge directed jury to return verdict
of not guilty of manslaughter and to consider if reckless driving proven—Whether
jury satisfied itself that accused was not guilty of manslaughter, and since
this a condition precedent, whether it had jurisdiction to consider offence of
reckless driving—Criminal Code , ss. 285 (6) , 951 (3) .

Section 951 (3)  of the Criminal Code  provides that,
upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle,
the jury if satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter but is
guilty of an offence under s. 285 (6) , may find him guilty of that offence.

The appellant was charged with manslaughter arising out of the
operation of a motor vehicle. The trial judge in charging the jury told them
there was no evidence to support the manslaughter charge and directed that they
bring in a verdict of not guilty on that count but left with them to determine
whether or not the appellant was guilty of reckless driving.

Held: that the jury in returning a verdict of not
guilty of manslaughter, followed the judge's direction on a question of law as
it was their duty to do; therefore the terms of the statute were met and their
verdict meant that, although acting in conformity with the judge's direction
and their duty, the jury was satisfied that the accused was not guilty of
manslaughter.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the
Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division 1 which dismissed his
appeal, (Richards C.J. dissenting), from a conviction and sentence for reckless
driving.

satisfied that the accused is not guilty of manslaughter"", as applied to
the jury in subsection (3)  of section 951  of the Criminal Code , should
be construed as introducing into the Code an entirely different
procedure from that which obtains in respect of any other offence dealt with in
the Code.

It is too clear for words that upon the trial of an
indictable offence the law is the province of the presiding judge and the
findings of fact are the province of the jury. Indeed the jury has no other
jurisdiction but to decide the facts, and in matters of law they must follow
the directions of the judge.

The learned counsel for the appellant herein would have this
court decide that the use in subsection (3) of section 951 of the words
""if"" (they the jury are) ""satisfied that the accused is not
guilty of manslaughter"" brought into the Code an entirely different
intention of Parliament, and that these words should be held to mean that the
jury alone is to announce its decision that the accused is not guilty of
manslaughter and the trial judge, in the instance, is deprived of any right to
pronounce upon the law and to direct the jury in accordance with the law.

In the present case, the learned judge charged the jury to
the effect that there was no evidence to support the charge of manslaughter and
directed the jury to find a verdict of not guilty on that charge. Counsel for
the appellant accordingly contends that that was contrary to the provisions of
subsection (3)  of section 951 , and for that reason the trial was abortive.

In doing what he did the learned judge followed the practice
outlined by this Court in Walker v. The King 2, where
it was decided that ""the proper practice is for the trial judge to direct
the jury to acquit"" insofar as the charge of manslaughter was concerned.
See also The King v. Comba 3.

The contention of the appellant's counsel would really lead
to the conclusion that subsection (3)  of section 951  should be treated as a law
by itself and should not be governed by the other sections of the Criminal
Code . But, although subsection (3) is new law, adopted by Parliament in
1938, it is, nevertheless, a part of the Criminal Code ;

[Page 649]

and, of course, standing by itself, it would not be
workable, unless all the sections of the Code are considered to be
applicable to it and to the method and procedure whereby it is to be operated.

As was pointed out in The Queen v. Morris 4,
at p. 95:

It must foe remembered that it is a sound rule to construe a
statute in conformity with the common law, rather than against it, except where

or so far as the statute is plainly intended to alter the
course of the common law.

And in Craies on Statute Law, 3rd edition, p. 112, it
is stated that ""to alter any clearly established principle of law a
distinct and positive legislative enactment is necessary."" Such a rule was
applied in this Court in the case of La Banque Canadienne
Nationale v. Carette 5.

It is quite clear, therefore, that there is nothing in
subsection (3)  of section 951  indicating the intention of the legislator to
submit charges within that subsection to be dealt with in the criminal
machinery in a way different from that which obtains in all other criminal
cases.

In returning a verdict of not guilty on the charge of
manslaughter, of course, the jury in the present case was following the
direction of the presiding judge on a question of law, to wit, on his statement
that there was no evidence adduced in the case to support a charge of
manslaughter, but in doing so they were acting in accordance with their duty,
as it has always been understood, in the application of the Criminal Code  in
this country; and their verdict that the appellant was not guilty of
manslaughter meant that they were satisfied with that result within the meaning
of subsection (3).

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Kerwin, Rand and Kellock, JJ. was delivered
by:

Kerwin J.: The
appellant was charged with manslaughter by wilful misconduct while driving an
automobile on the public highway. There had been a previous trial, at which
there was a disagreement of the jury. On the second trial, the appellant called
no evidence and in his address to the jury, counsel for the Crown stated that
there was no evidence sufficient to justify a verdict of manslaughter but
suggested that the appellant might be found guilty under subsection 6 of
section 285 of driving

[Page 650]

recklessly or in a manner dangerous to the public. The trial
judge agreed with the statement of Crown counsel and while it is argued that in
his charge he withdrew manslaughter from the jury, what he actually did was to
direct the jury that they must bring in a verdict of not guilty. In so doing,
he was following the proper practice, where he decides there is no
evidence to go to the jury: Walker v. The King 6.

The only point in the appeal may be put thus. Since the
trial judge removed from the jury any consideration of the evidence on the
manslaughter charge, it cannot be said, in the words of subsection 3  of section
951 , that the jury were ""satisfied that the accused is not guilty of
manslaughter."" It is true that in returning a verdict of not guilty of
that charge, the jury were only obeying the directions of the judge on a
question of law but as it was their duty to follow those directions, the terms
of the statute are met; that is, although acting in conformity with the judge's
directions and their duty, the jury were satisfied that the accused was not
guilty of manslaughter.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Taschereau J.:
Section 951(3)  of the Criminal Code  reads as follows:

(3) Upon a charge of manslaughter arising out of the
operation of a motor vehicle the jury, and in the province of Alberta a judge
having jurisdiction and sitting without a jury, if satisfied that the
accused is not guilty of manslaughter but is guilty of an offence under
subsection six of section two hundred and eighty-five may find him guilty of
that offence and such conviction shall be a bar to further prosecution for any
offence arising out of the same facts.

The ""included offence"" in the above section is the
following:

285(6) Every one who drives a motor vehicle on a street,
road, highway or other public place recklessly, or in a manner which is
dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case,
including the nature, condition, and use of the street, road, highway or place,
and the amount of traffic which is actually at the time, or which might
reasonably be expected to be, on such street, road, highway or place, shall be
guilty of an offence and liable

(a) upon indictment to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine not exceeding one
thousand dollars or to both such imprisonment and fine; or

(b) on summary conviction
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to a fine not
exceeding one hundred dollars or to both such imprisonment and fine.

The appellant was charged with manslaughter arising out of the
operation of a motor vehicle, and he was tried before Mr. Justice Leblanc and
jury, in September, 1948.

At the conclusion of the evidence for the prosecution, the
learned trial judge withdrew from the consideration of the jury the charge of
manslaughter, and directed them to find the accused ""not guilty"" of
manslaughter. He further added: ""There is no more charge of manslaughter
for you to consider"". The jury retired and the appellant was found guilty
of ""reckless driving"", which is the offence described in section
285(6)  Cr. C. This conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal, Chief Justice
Richards dissenting 7.

It is submitted on behalf of the appellant, that the jury
had no jurisdiction to render such a verdict, because before reaching such a
conclusion, the jury must satisfy themselves that the accused was not
guilty of manslaughter, and as the consideration of a finding on the
manslaughter charge had been withdrawn from the jury, there was no jurisdiction
to consider ""reckless driving"".

I am of the opinion that this contention fails. It is the
duty of the trial judge, when the evidence does not disclose an offence, to
withdraw the charge from the jury, and it is also the duty of the jury to
accept the direction of the judge. The words found in section 951(3)  that
""the jury * * * if satisfied that the accused is not guilty of
manslaughter but is guilty of an offence under subsection (6)  of section 285
etc."" do not mean only that the jury may be satisfied that the
facts do not reveal a crime of manslaughter; these words also mean that the
jury may be satisfied that in law there is no manslaughter, and the
trial judge is the only competent authority to advise them on that matter. This
is what happened in the present case, and the jury having been satisfied that
in law there was no offence of manslaughter, could properly bring in a verdict
of reckless driving.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeals by Attorney General—Whether
Crown Counsel’s failure to object to misdirection in charge to jury bars Crown’s
right of appeal—The Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 1013(4), as enacted
by 1930, c. 11, s. 28.

Section 1013 (4)  of the Criminal Code 
provides that: “Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained, the
Attorney General shall have the right to appeal to the court of appeal against
any judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in respect of an
indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law
alone.”

The appellant was acquitted by a jury of a
charge laid under s. 276(a), and of a second charge laid under s. 292 (a),
of the Criminal Code . The Attorney General of Ontario as provided by s.
1013 (4) of the Code (supra) appealed, and the Court of Appeal for
Ontario allowed the appeal, set aside the verdict, and ordered a new trial. On
appeal to this Court—

Held: (Rand J.
dissenting), that the proper rule to be followed by an appellate court upon an
appeal by an attorney general under s. 1013 (4)  from a verdict of acquittal is
that the onus is on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not
necessarily have been the same if there had been no error in law in the trial
judge’s charge, and that here such onus had been discharged.

Held: also,
that there is no rule of law nor of practice that failure of counsel, whether
for an accused or for the Crown, to object to a charge to a jury on the grounds
of misdirection is of necessity a bar to the right of appeal. No such rule
applicable in all circumstances exists, and in the circumstances of the present
case, such failure by Crown counsel did not affect the right of appeal.

Per: Rand J.,
(dissenting), “Any ground of appeal”, referred to in s. 1013 (4) of the Code,
must be limited to matters in which the course of the Crown is thwarted or
impeded unwarrantably by the Court. It does not arise from misdirection or
non-direction where no objection was taken by Crown Counsel at the trial and
there are no circumstances implicating the accused in that action.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1],
allowing an appeal by

[Page 659]

the Attorney General for Ontario against the
accused’s acquittal by a jury on charges under ss. 276  (a) and 292  (a)
of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1927, a 36.

Wilfred Judson K.C. and John W. Graham for
the appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice, Taschereau
and Locke, JJ. was delivered by:

LOCKE, J.:—The charges against the appellant
were laid under secs. 276 (a) and 292 (a) of the Criminal Code 
and the evidence adduced by the Crown, if believed, proved the commission
of both offences. The girl, Doreen McMunn, aged seventeen, gave evidence that
she had been induced by the appellant to go with him to a room in a hotel in
Perth and that there he had beaten her severely, choked her into a state of
unconsciousness, attempted to rape her and indecently assaulted her. Doctor
Hagyard, a physician practising in Perth, had examined the girl on the day
following the assault and found a lot of bruising on the right side of her
face, her right lip cut, her neck badly swollen and her chest so badly bruised and
swollen that he expected that some of the ribs or the breast bone might have
been fractured. In addition to these injuries, the upper part of her arms was
swollen and bruised and there was a great deal of bruising on the right side of
her neck and, in the opinion of the Doctor, the force applied to her neck must
have been so severe as to cause unconsciousness. Further evidence as to her
injuries was given by the witness Nagle who came to the hotel room in response
to the girl’s cry for help and found her with a cut on her lip and on one of
her eyes and the room in a state of disorder. The Chief of Police who came to
the room shortly thereafter and saw the girl observed the cut on her lip and
red welts on both sides of her neck. In addition to this evidence, a statement
made by the appellant to the Chief of Police was put in evidence: this was to
the effect that he had come to Perth that day, that he had been drinking and
that while he remembered that Doreen McMunn had been in his room he did not
remember what had happened or seeing the Police or leaving the hotel. He made
no statement regarding the alleged offences.

[Page 660]

In the charge to the jury the learned trial
judge instructed them in part as follows:—

Now as I understand the defence to both
these charges, it is that the girl consented and secondly, the accused’s
condition from drinking, that he was drunk and so drunk that he did not know
what he was doing.

and again:—

Now, counsel for the defence has referred
to several things substantiating, as he presents the defence that there
was consent—oh yes, there is also this, that he mentioned there is no
corroboration of the essentials to this offence and it is my duty, I think, to
charge you that it is unsafe—I don’t know there is any statute that says you
must have corroboration in connection with either of these two charges, but
speaking as a matter of common sense and common experience and observation and
practice in the courts, it is the duty of the judge to tell you that it is
dangerous, it is unsafe, to convict on the evidence of the girl alone, unless
it is corroborated by other evidence implicating the accused as to the offence
charged. That doesn’t mean that everything, that all the essentials must be
corroborated but there must be corroboration to the extent that you feel, you
find there is indication of implication of his guilt of the offence charged.
Now, as to both these charges, I think as to both of them, if the girl
consented that is a defence with the exception I think, and my attention
will be drawn to what I am saying later if it is thought I am wrong, as to the
first charge, that is the one with intent to commit rape choking so as to
render unconscious or incapable of resistance, that if the consent there is
brought about by threats and fear so that you find, you feel you should find,
it is not a real consent, then it isn’t consent. Now, in this matter of
consent, the mere fact the girl puts up some resistance it seems to me doesn’t
necessarily indicate that she has not consented. She might make a mild sort of
physical protest not wanting to indicate too readily a surrender of her virtue
and still be willing enough that the action occur. The point for you to decide
is whether or not in fact on the evidence you believe there was or was not consent,
on the conduct and evidence otherwise pertinent to that.

While the learned trial judge thus informed the
jury that one of the defences was that the accused was so drunk he did not know
what he was doing, the only evidence on the point was that of the Chief of
Police who said that it was evident that the man had been drinking but that he
was quite steady on his feet, his speech was quite normal and, in the officer’s
opinion, he was not intoxicated. As to those portions of the charge dealing
with the necessity for corroboration, the learned trial judge was clearly in
error. There was in law no necessity for corroboration but, had there been,
there was ample corroboration in the evidence of the doctor and of Nagle and
the Chief of Police of material parts of the girl’s story implicating the

[Page 661]

accused. This the trial judge failed to point
out to the jury. As to the instructions on the question of consent, I agree
with Mr. Justice Hogg that consent would not be a defence to either
charge. There were other material defects in the charge mentioned in the Notice
of Appeal given by the Attorney-General but it appears to me to be unnecessary
to consider them.

At the conclusion of the judge’s charge, counsel
for the Crown made no objection to it and the case went to the jury who
acquitted the appellant on both charges. The important question to be
determined upon this appeal is as to whether the failure to object to the
charge bars the right of appeal given to the Attorney-General under
sec. 1013 (4) of the Code.

The right of appeal to the Court of Appeal
against any judgment or verdict of acquittal in a trial court in respect of an
indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law
alone was first given by s. 28, c. 11, Statutes of Canada 1930. As to the
manner of the exercise of the right thus given to the Attorney-General,
subsection 5, enacted at the same time, provided that the procedure upon
such an appeal and the powers of the Court of Appeal, including the power to grant
a new trial, should mutatis mutandis, in so far as the same are
applicable to appeals upon a question of law alone, be similar to the procedure
prescribed and the powers given by ss. 1012 to 1021 of the Code and to
the rules of court passed pursuant thereto and to s. 576. The powers of the
court on an appeal by the Attorney‑General are thus clearly defined as
co-extensive with its powers in dealing with a question of law on an appeal
from conviction. In the case of an appeal by a convicted person, a failure on
the part of his counsel to object to the admissibility of material evidence was
held not to prejudice his right of appeal from a conviction in Rex v. William
Stirland[2]. The
rule in civil matters was stated by Duff J. as he then was, in delivering the
judgment of the full Court of British Columbia in Scott v. Fernie[3]. In that action which was to recover
damages for negligence, questions apparently approved by counsel for both
parties were submitted to a jury and a verdict found for the

[Page 662]

plaintiff. The defendant appealed, asserting as
one of the grounds that a further issue of fact should have been submitted.
Duff J. there said:

It is, perhaps, needless to say that in
these circumstances, but for the legislation hereinafter referred to (i.e. s.
66 of the Supreme Court Act of British Columbia, 1904), the rule long
established, which holds a litigant to a position deliberately assumed by his
counsel at the trial, would preclude in this Court any discussion of the
sufficiency of the findings to support the judgment. The rule is no mere
technicality of practice; but the particular application of a sound and
all-important maxim—that litigants shall not play fast and loose with the
course of litigation—finding a place one should expect, in any enlightened system
of forensic procedure.

In Spencer v. Field[4], the judgment of Davis J. with which Duff
C.J.C. and Hudson J. concurred, expressly approved what had been said in Scott
v. Fernie and referred to “the long established rule which holds a
litigant to a position deliberately assumed by his counsel at the trial.” In Wexler
v. The King[5], the
application of sec. 1013(4) of the Code was considered by this
Court. The appellant had been tried on a charge of murder and the case
presented by the Crown against him was that he had intentionally shot a woman
with the intention of killing her. The contention of the defence was that the
shooting was the result of an accident and the trial judge instructed the jury
that if they believed the account given by the accused he was entitled to be
acquitted, and this instruction was accepted by both counsel as
correctly stating the single issue of fact which was to be put before the jury.
The jury returned a verdict of not guilty but on an appeal the verdict was set
aside and a new trial directed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in
omitting to instruct the jury first, that from certain facts disclosed by the
evidence of the appellant the jury might have convicted the accused of murder
under s. 259(c) and (d) of the Code, and secondly,
that the accused having in. his charge a loaded firearm and being bound to take
reasonable precautions to avoid danger to human life, the jury might have
convicted the accused of manslaughter under ss. 247 and 252(2). Counsel
for the Crown in this Court stated that the only issue which counsel for the
Crown intended to put before the jury was that in fact put before them. Sir
Lyman Duff C.J. in delivering judgment allowing the 

[Page 663]

appeal said that the point was not merely that
the Crown did not take exception to the learned judge’s charge, but that the
conduct of the trial with respect to the single issue of fact which was raised
by the case put forward by the Crown was admittedly unimpeachable and that the
jury had been told by the Crown that the determination of that issue in favour
of the accused would entitle him to an acquittal. Kerwin J. who delivered the
judgment of the majority of the Court, and with whose reasons the Chief Justice
also agreed, said that the real point to be determined was whether the Crown
was entitled to an order for a new trial in order to present an entirely new
case against the accused and pointed out that during the course of the trial
nothing of the nature then sought for the first time to be advanced had been
submitted for the consideration of the jury.

In Rex v. Munroe[6], the Attorney-General appealed from the
acquittal of Munroe, who had been charged with arson, on the ground of
misdirection, although no objection was taken by the Crown to the charge at the
trial. Sloan J.A., now Chief Justice of British Columbia, was of the opinion
that, while the failure of counsel for an accused to object to a charge was not
necessarily fatal to the right of the convicted appellant to raise the issue on
appeal, this did not apply in favour of the Crown on an appeal from an
acquittal, saying in part:

Whether the prisoner is defended or
undefended when Crown counsel elects to go to the jury without objection to the
charge, then he is, in my opinion, bound by the resultant verdict.

and referred to the decision of this Court in Wexler’s
case[7]. Martin
C.J.B.C. agreed with Sloan J.A. and said that the practical and grave
consequences of allowing such an appeal for misdirection where no objection had
been made would be that the Crown “will get a new trial because of its own
oversight at the expense of the accused” and said further that, in his opinion,
the Court should decline to entertain the appeal because to do so would be to
violate a long and well established principle of fundamental justice. MacDonald
J.A. said that he preferred not to join in the view expressed by the Chief
Justice that failure to object was fatal to the Crown’s case and McQuarrie J.A.
and O’Halloran J.A. agreed with him.

[Page 664]

However, in Rex v. Fleming[8], the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
held that the failure of Crown counsel to object to the judge’s charge was a
fatal objection to an appeal from an acquittal on the ground of misdirection
and expressly approved the judgments of Martin C.J.B.C. and Sloan J.A. in Munroe’s
case. In Rex v. Rasmussen[9],
Barry C.J.K.B. expressed the opinion that the failure to object to a charge on
the ground of non-direction did not affect the right of appeal, though no
objection was made at the time.

There is no rule of law nor, in my opinion, of
practice that failure of counsel, either for an accused or for the Crown or in
civil matters for a litigant, to object to a charge to the jury on the ground
of misdirection, is of necessity a bar to the right of appeal. No such general
rule applicable in all circumstances exists. In civil matters the true
principle has been stated in Scott v. Fernie and Spencer v.
Field. I do not think it can be said that in all criminal proceedings
the principle applied in civil matters must be followed. The right of appeal
given to the Attorney-General by the amendment of 1930 introduced a new
principle into the administration of criminal justice, that is, that a man
might under certain circumstances be tried again upon a criminal charge after
having been acquitted. It would be, in my opinion, inadvisable to attempt to
lay down a general rule in a matter of this nature. In the present case, the
accused did not give evidence and called no witnesses and, from the terms of
the charge, it is clear that it was the address of counsel for the accused that
led the learned trial judge into giving the erroneous instructions on the
questions of consent and corroboration. There is nothing to indicate what the
nature of the supposed consent was. It can scarcely have been contended that
this young girl had given her consent to being beaten, choked and indecently
assaulted with violence, even if her consent would have been an answer to the
charge. The Crown has discharged the onus cast upon it of satisfying the Court
of Appeal that had the jury been properly instructed the verdict would not
necessarily have been the same, a conclusion with which I entirely agree. The
principle followed in the cases of

[Page 665]

Wexler, supra and
of Savard and Lizotte[10] has
here no application. Under these circumstances, I think the failure to object
to the judge’s charge does not affect the right of appeal.

This appeal should be dismissed.

KERWIN J.:—I would dismiss the appeal. I adhere
to the view expressed by me in White v. The King[11], that the proper rule to be followed by an
Appellate Court upon an appeal by an attorney general from an acquittal, even
when such acquittal is by a jury, is that the onus is on the Crown to satisfy
the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if there
had been no error in law in the trial judge’s charge.

As to the point that the Crown is deprived of an
appeal where counsel for the Crown at the trial does not object to the judge’s
charge (as was the case here), I am of opinion that this result cannot follow
in all cases. There may be circumstances where the result of such a failure on
the part of Crown counsel would be fatal but not here.

RAND J. (dissenting):—The appellant was charged
under section 276 (a) of the Criminal Code  with having
attempted to render a young woman of 17½ years unconscious or incapable of
resistance by choking her with intent to enable him to commit rape upon her. On
the evidence presented by the prosecution he was acquitted. The
Attorney-General thereupon appealed and a new trial was ordered.

The point of law on which the case comes to this
Court is very simple. The acquittal was set aside because of what was
considered serious misdirection and non-direction to the jury, as to which,
however, there was no objection or request on the part of counsel representing
the Crown; and the question is whether the Attorney-General in such a case can
bring himself within the intendment of section 1013(4) .

The right of appeal given to the Crown by that
section is an innovation in the procedure of criminal law, and I have been
unable to discover that it exists, certainly in the form in which the Code provides,
in any other common law jurisdiction. It is such a striking departure from

[Page 666]

fundamental principles of security for the
individual that I find it necessary to examine the language of the statute in
the background in which it ought I think to be interpreted.

The subsection reads:—

Notwithstanding anything in this Act
contained, the Attorney-General shall have the right to appeal to the Court of
Appeal against any judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in respect
of an indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a question of
law alone.

What then is “any ground of appeal”? What are
the considerations necessary to a “ground of appeal” generally in the
administration of law? That it is not equivalent to error in law simpliciter
occurring in the course of proceedings, is, I should say, undoubted, but to
come to any clear or definite answer to the question we must, I think, recall
to mind the basic character of proceedings in judicature.

In the common pleas presented to courts,
contests between individuals over conflicting claims, the theory of the common
law is that the court resolves the dispute according to the law of the land,
but in the role of an impartial arbiter: it is not of itself concerned in the
merits of the conflict though it may be said to be so in the settlement of it.
Either party may deal with or dispose of his private right by any of the modes
recognized, including abandonment, as he pleases; he is likewise in command of
his case before the tribunal, and he is bound by the presentation which he
makes. He is presumed to know his legal rights, and if he stands by when he can
and should object or protest against what is a disregard of prescribed rules,
he is not, in general, permitted thereafter to complain of what he could then
and there have had corrected or have protested. In other words, a ground of
complaint must be based upon the denial of what in law he is entitled to and
endeavours to assert: but being able to deal with his rights as he sees fit he
will not be permitted to play fast and loose with the serious conduct of a
tribunal exercising a vital function of government: Lord Halsbury in Nevill v.
Fine Art Co.[12], at p.
76; Scott v. Fernie[13].

[Page 667]

In the administration of the criminal law, the
pleas of the crown, however, the underlying conception is in some respects
different. The King symbolizes the “fountain of justice”, ‘but at the same time
there is committed to him in his executive capacity the functions of enforcing
the public law against offenders. All prosecutions are in his name, i.e. they
are “at the suit” of the King; and in a solemn proceeding it is determined by
the “country” in the form of twelve fellow citizens, almost invariably
representing the community in which the act has been committed and generally to
which the accused belongs, whether or not the latter is guilty as charged. In
that formal process the notion of an issue of “rights” in a civil sense is out
of place.

The characterizing feature is the scope of
executive discretion. Arising from the same source as the abrogated historical
power of dispensation is the right of nolle prosequi preserved in effect
by section 962 of the Code, by which the Attorney-General may, at
any point up to judgment, stay proceedings; and notwithstanding the right of
the subject to initiate prosecutions, this power obviously puts the Crown in
command of all indictments: Rex v. Edwards[14]. Then either before or after judgment the
prerogative of pardon can be exercised. Finally there is the unchallengeable
discretion to determine what evidence shall be presented and what not, what the
form of the case put to the jury shall be and what not, what course of action
shall be taken at any stage of the prosecution and what not, and just as
clearly, what objections to the charge to the jury, either for what has been
improperly stated or notstated at all, shall be taken or omitted. It is the
matter and the form of fact which the Crown exhibits to the jury, either by way
of evidence or address or of any other participation in the proceedings,
including objection to or acquiescence in any act of the court, from which in
the aspect of the prosecution the guilt or innocence of the accused is to be
determined; and the Crown will not be held to have a ground of appeal where the
matter complained of was that the trial judge had not put to the jury a case on
the facts not asked for by the Crown and

[Page 668]

different from that to which the Crown limited
itself: Wexler v. The King[15],
followed in Savard and Lizotte v. The King[16], in which the conviction on the case put
by the Crown and found by the jury could not be supported.

At the foundation of criminal law lies the
cardinal principle that no man shall be placed in jeopardy twice for the same
matter and the reasons underlying that principle are grounded in deep social
instincts. It is the supreme invasion of the rights of an individual to subject
him by the physical power of the community to a test which may mean the
loss of his liberty or his life; and there is a basic repugnance against the
repeated exercise of that power on the same facts unless for strong reasons of
public policy. The position of the accused is in sharp contrast to that of the
prosecution. He is charged with a violation of public law; but he is entitled
to remain passive, and to have the charge proved if it can be proved only in
accordance with those observances which the law for his protection has
prescribed. The setting aside of a conviction or the granting of a new trial to
a person who has been found guilty in circumstances in which there has been a
failure in those essential requirements seems to me to be a necessary corollary
of that right unless no substantial wrong has been done or unless by
affirmative conduct on his part he can be said to have implicated himself in
the impropriety later objected to.

But the abstention of the Crown in similar
circumstances is quite another matter. Section 1013(4)  does indeed give a
right of appeal, but “any ground of appeal” must I think be limited to matters
in which the course of the Crown is thwarted or impeded unwarrantably by the
court. A failure on the part of crown counsel to object to improper or
insufficient directions must arise either from a lack of appreciation of their
objectionable character, or a deliberate decision for various reasons to allow
matters to stand as they are. Are we then to say that that lack of appreciation
is a “ground of appeal” sufficient to supersede such a fundamental rule as that
against second jeopardy? And if the omission is deliberate, have we not
immediately, in an appeal, what has been termed “playing fast and loose” with
the court?

[Page 669]

If the ground of allowance of an appeal goes to
the degree of failure on the part of the court, to the point say of apparent
miscarriage, there is of course a corresponding delinquency on the part of
crown counsel; and can that justify such an intolerable burden on the accused
as necessarily follows? An innocent person may thus be subjected to a most
crippling expense, to say nothing of the pain or humiliation. Criminal
proceedings have not yet become a species of semi-respectable contests in which
effects are in dollars and cents only. A prosecution is still too serious a
matter to be assimilated with party litigation. The ruling which confirms the
order of the court below in this case places the appeal of the Attorney-General
on the same footing as that of the accused, and virtually identifies criminal
with civil appeal. I quite agree that should the accused be involved with
improper action by crown counsel wholly different considerations arise; but it
is following a will-o-the-wisp justice, in cases in which, from a written
record, the action of a jury seems inexplicable, to depart from principles long
verified in experience. There is to be avoided, also, the danger of treating a
case of this sort as being an adjudication between the victim and the accused.
It is not that. What is being asserted is the paramount interest of the state
in maintaining order and personal security. The safeguarding of that interest
has been committed to public officers, and we must leave with them the manner
in which it is to be vindicated. If they fail, they may call upon themselves
public condemnation; but on the soundest considerations of policy, the course
of judicial action should not be grounded on the court’s reaction to the
individual case. Surely an accused, as a condition of a definitive acquittal,
is not to be forced to see that the charge is in order as against himself. He
is entitled to say that he can be convicted only in accordance with the
requirements of law; is he to be told that he can be acquitted only if the Attorney-General
or his representative has done his duty as a court of appeal may conceive it?

In Rex v. Munroe[17], Sloan J.A., the present Chief Justice of
British Columbia, came to the conclusion to

[Page 670]

which I am driven and with him Martin C.J.
agreed. Their view was later followed unanimously by the Court of Appeal of
that province in Rex v. Fleming[18].

For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion
that the right of appeal given to the Attorney‑General does not arise for
misdirection or non-direction where no objection was taken by crown counsel at
the trial and there are no circumstances implicating the accused in that
action. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the verdict of
acquittal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Evidence—Exporting to destination not
authorized by permit—Entry on bill of lading made by customs officer pursuant
to duty under foreign law—Whether admissible—Error and defect in notice of
appeal—Export and Import Permits Act , 1947, c. 17, ss. 5 , 13 — Criminal Coda, s.
1018(2).

The appellant was charged with having exported tin plate from
Canada to an ultimate destination not authorized by his permit for the export,
issued under the Export and Import Permits Act , 1947, c. 17. The goods
were to be shipped from Montreal to New York for furtherance to a South
American country. The evidence consisted of a customs bill of lading, produced
from the records of the Collector of Customs at New York, on which a signed
entry was endorsed to the effect that the goods had been shipped from the
United States destined to a

[Page 108]

European country. The bill had been prepared for admittance of
the goods to the United States and was required by the law of that country.

Held: As to counts other than 6 and 7, the document was
admissible.

Held further: As to counts 6 and 7, the copies of
documents before the Court were improperly admitted and the appeal as to these
counts was allowed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1,
reversing the trial judge's decision and convicting the appellant.

A. Tourigny Q.C. and J. Drapeau for
the appellant.

G. W. Hill Q.C. and J. G. Ahearn
Q.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:—

Rand J. : The
charge against the accused was for exporting tin plate from Canada to an
ultimate destination not authorized by the permit for the export, and the
substantial question in the appeal concerns a rule of evidence.

The goods were shipped from Montreal to New York for
furtherance by water to a country in South America on bills of lading showing
the accused to be the shipper. For admittance to the United States at the
border point, what is called a customs bill of lading is made out by the
railway on behalf of the shipper from the information furnished on the bill of
lading; and since, on such a transit through the United States, the goods must
be in bond, the customs bill of lading, supplemented, undoubtedly, by an
official seal placed on the car, evidenced the receipt of the goods from the
Customs authorities and committed them to the Collector of Customs at New York.
The document was produced in court from the records of the Collector by his
assistant solicitor. Endorsed on it was a signed entry that the goods had been
shipped from the United States destined to a European country.

That control of the goods by the customs department of the
government, effected by the customs bill of lading, was required by the law of
the United States. In order that the transit be cleared, it was necessary that
the goods should be exported and the entry to that effect on the records of the
Customs Collector made in the course of public duty authenticates that fact.
The document accepted in evidence contained such a record, and the question is
whether it was admissible.

[Page 109]

The argument made to us somewhat confused the admissibility
of an entry made strictly in the course of business and one made pursuant to a
public duty. The rule in, relation to the latter does not seem ever to have
been doubted. As early as 1785 in R. v. Aickles 2, it is said:

The law reposes such a confidence in public officers that it
presumes they will discharge their several trusts with accuracy and fidelity;
and therefore whatever acts they do in discharge of their public duty may be
given in evidence and shall be taken to be true, under such a degree of caution
as the nature and circumstances of each case may appear to require.

In Doe v. France 3, Erle J. says:

It depends upon the public duty of the person who keeps the
register to make such entries in it, after satisfying himself of their truth.

In Irish Society v. Bishop of Derry 4, Parke B. says:

The bishop in making the return discharged a public duty,
and faith is given that they would perform their duty correctly; the return is
therefore admissible on the same principle on which other public documents are
received.

In Richardson v. Mellish 5, in admitting a list showing the
names, capacities and descriptions of all persons embarked on a ship, Best
C.J., overruling an objection, said:

For the purpose of proving the damage, the plaintiff put in
a list returned by a captain under the authority of 53 Geo. III, cap. 155. It is
contended that that paper was not evidence against third parties. I am
decidedly of opinion that there is no foundation for that objection. This is a
public paper made out by a public officer under a sanction and responsibility
which impel him to make that paper out accurately; and that being the case, it
is admissible in evidence, on the principle on which sailing instructions, the
list of convoy, and the list of the crew of a ship are admissible.

The grounds for this exception to the hearsay rule are the
inconvenience of the ordinary modes of proof and the trustworthiness of the
entry arising from the duty, and that they apply much more forcefully in the
complex governmental functions of today is beyond controversy. They have equal
force in the case of an entry made pursuant to a duty under a foreign as well
as a domestic law ; People v. Reese 6 (Cardozo C.J.). In the infinite
variety of commercial relations we have with the United States, it would be
virtually impossible in such a case as that before us to establish proof if
this long accepted rule could not

[Page 110]

be invoked; and since the Court retains a discretion in
admitting the document, any special circumstances tending to qualify the
dependability of the entry would be subjected to judicial scrutiny.

It was urged by Mr. Tourigny, however, that for two of the
shipments there was no evidence that the ultimate destination had been other
than that authorized by the permit. The original documents in the office of the
Customs Collector in New York had been mislaid and were not available and
photostat copies tendered were rejected; there is, therefore, no evidence of
the destination of export from New York before the Court. It is necessary,
then, to consider, first, the precise requirement of the permit that is alleged
to have been violated and the extent to which that violation can be said to be
shown by the documents before us.

Sec. 5  of the Export and Import Permits Act  reads :

No person shall export or attempt to export from Canada any
goods included in a list established pursuant to section three of this Act
except under the authority of and in accordance with a permit issued under this
Act.

The permit given the accused is headed
""Application for permit to export war materials and other goods"" ;
the name of the consignee is Charles Brauner, New York; the country of ultimate
destination is stated to be Peru ; and the application is granted ""subject
to the conditions entered on the reverse side of this permit."" No such
conditions are shown.

All that can be deduced from this, as the charge laid shows,
is that to be exported in accordance with the permit, the goods must have as
their ultimate destination a point in Peru.

The first of these two counts, No. 6, is supported by bill
of lading for Car No. 29107 stated to have been shipped in bond to New York
City for export ""under T. & E. entry to Callao, Peru."" ; the
second, No. 7, by bill of lading for Car No. 144541, shipped likewise in bond
to New York for export ""under T. & E. entry to Callao, Peru."" The
former is endorsed ""intended for S.S. Copgapo, Chilean Line"" ;
the latter ""intended for S.S. Santa Louisa, Grace Line."" I am
unable to see how it can be contended that these acts of the accused in Canada
contained in the directions and entries on the bill of lading can be taken to
evidence a shipment in violation of the permit.

[Page 111]

A further point was taken that the notice of appeal by the
Crown was insufficient. There was admittedly an error in the description of the
charges from the acquittal on which the appeal was being taken; but the
references to the Court and to the dates of the adjudications made clear to the
accused both the error in the description and the judgments against which the
appeal was being taken. Mr. Tourigny frankly conceded that the accused was in
no way misled.

Under sec. 1018 (2) of the Criminal Code  the time
within which notice of appeal may be given may be extended at any time by the
Court of Appeal. The point was considered by that Court in this case, but was rejected,
which can only mean that the notice was dealt with in such a manner as brought
the appeal properly before the Court. There is no question of the jurisdiction
to do that and we would not interfere with a discretion so exercised.

I would, therefore, alow the appeal as to counts 6 and 7 and
dismiss it as to the others.

Appeal dismissed except as to counts 6 and 7.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE
 OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Trial by jury—Refusal of motion made by
accused for trial by an English jury—Accused fluent in both official
languages—What is language habitually spoken by accused—Criminal Code , ss. 923 ,
924 , 937 , 1023 .

The law does not give to an accused in the Province of Quebec
who moves that he be tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the
French language or entirely composed of jurors speaking the English language an
unconditional right to be tried accordingly or, at least, tried by a mixed
jury. His right is limited to demanding trial by a jury skilled in whichever of
the two official languages of the Province is the language habitually spoken by
him. (Cartwright J., being of the view that this Court had no jurisdiction,
expressed no opinion upon the question).

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1,
affirming, Bissonnette and Casey JJ.A. dissenting, the appellant's conviction
on a charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of an automobile.

Lucien Gagnon for the appellant.

Georges Sylvestre Q.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux JJ.
was delivered by:—

Fauteux J.:—Accusé, dans le district de Joliette, province de Québec, d'y avoir
commis l'offense d'homicide involontaire, l'appelant—dont la langue maternelle
est l'italien et qui parle aussi le français et l'anglais couramment, depuis
plusieurs années,—demanda, lors de la mise en accusation d'être jugé par un
jury de langue anglaise. A cette requête, la Couronne fit objection et à la
suite d'une enquête ordonnée et tenue pour déterminer la langue parlée par
l'accusé, la demande fut rejetée et la cause s'instruisit devant un jury de
langue française. Trouvé coupable, Piperno porta la cause en appel 2, invoquant plusieurs moyens qui
tous, sauf un, furent unanimement rejetés. Seul

[Page 293]

le grief ""qu'il avait droit à un jury
anglais"" donna lieu à une dissidence. La majorité des Juges concluant
qu'en fait, le français était la langue habituellement parlée par l'accusé
depuis plusieurs années, déclara le grief mal fondé et, comme conséquence,
l'appel fut rejeté. Les dissidents adoptèrent sur le point une vue contraire
avec, évidemment, une conclusion différente quant au résultat.

Piperno invoque maintenant cette dissidence et
les dispositions de l'article 1023  du Code Criminel  pour en appeler
devant cette Cour.

Assumant que nous ayons juridiction, je
n'hésiterais pas, vu l'opinion majoritaire et finale de la Cour d'Appel sur la
question de fait, à rejeter comme elle ce pourvoi. Car je ne crois pas que la
loi ou l'interprétation qu'on en a fait jusqu'à ce jour dans la province de
Québec, donnent à un accusé qui demande à être jugé par un jury composé
entièrement de jurés parlant la langue française ou par un jury composé
entièrement de jurés parlant la langue anglaise, un droit absolu de réussir sur
cette demande, ou d'obtenir, à tout le moins, d'être jugé par un jury mixte,
i.e., par un jury composé d'au moins six personnes versées dans la langue de
l'accusé.

La loi. Il convient de reproduire les
dispositions des articles 923  et 924  du Code Criminel ,—dispositions
d'exception, respectivement applicables dans les provinces de Québec et du
Manitoba,— et aussi celles de l'article 937  lequel, référant à ces deux
dispositions spéciales, les interprète et en donne ainsi la véritable portée:—

923. Dans ceux des districts de la province de
Québec où le shérif est tenu par la loi de dresser une liste de petits jurés
composée moitié de personnes parlant la langue anglaise, et moitié de personnes
parlant la langue française, il doit, dans son rapport, mentionner séparément
les jurés qu'il désigne comme parlant la langue anglaise, et ceux qu'il désigne
comme parlant la langue française, respectivement; et les noms des jurés ainsi
assignés sont appelés alternativement d'après ces listes.

2. Dans tout district, le prisonnier peut,
lorsqu'il est mis en jugement, demander par motion, d'être jugé par un jury
entièrement composé de jurés parlant la langue anglaise, ou entièrement composé
de jurés parlant la langue française.

3. Sur présentation de cette motion, le juge
peut ordonner au shérif d'assigner un nombre suffisant de jurés parlant la
langue anglaise ou la langue française, à moins qu'à sa discrétion il
n'apparaisse que les fins de la justice sont mieux servies par la composition
d'un jury mixte. S.R., c. 146, art. 923; 1925, c. 38, art. 23.

[Page 294]

924. Lorsqu'une personne mise en jugement
devant la Cour du banc du Roi pour le Manitoba demande un jury composé de
moitié au moins de personnes versées dans la langue de la défense, si c'est la
langue anglaise ou la langue française, elle est jugée par un jury composé; de
moitié au moins, des personnes dont les noms se trouvent les premiers à la
suite les uns des autres sur la liste générale des jurés, et qui, comparaissant
et n'étant point légalement récusées, sont, de l'avis de la cour, trouvées
versées dans la langue de la défense.

2. Lorsque par suite du nombre de récusations
ou pour toute autre cause, le nombre des personnes versées dans la langue de la
défense est insuffisant, la cour remet le procès à un autre jour, et le shérif supplée
à l'insuffisance en assignant pour le jour ainsi fixé tel nombre supplémentaire
que la cour ordonne de jurés versés dans la langue de la défense et dont les
noms se trouvent inscrits après les premiers, à la suite les uns des autres,
sur la liste des petits jurés. S.R., c. 146, art. 924.

937. Lorsqu'une personne accusée d'une
infraction qui lui donnerait droit à vingt ou à douze récusations péremptoires
comme susdit, demande à subir son procès devant un jury composé pour moitié de
personnes versées dans la langue de la défense, en vertu des articles neuf cent
vingt-trois ou neuf cent vingt-quatre, le nombre de récusations péremptoires
auquel elle a droit doit être partagé de manière qu'elle n'ait le droit de
récuser péremptoirement que la moitié de ce nombre parmi les jurés de langue
anglaise, et la moitié parmi les jurés de langue française, S.R., c. 146, art.
937.

Notons d'abord, incidemment, que dans ces
trois articles d'exception, il n'est pas question de la nationalité, des
origines, traditions ou mentalité des jurés ou de l'accusé. Seule la question
de langue est considérée.

Disons ensuite que suivant ces articles 923 et
924, il est permis, dans les provinces de Québec et du Manitoba respectivement,
à un accusé de faire un choix de jurés en tenant compte de la langue qu'ils
parlent. Mais alors que l'article 924 indique manifestement que cette faculté
donnée à l'accusé se fonde et se conditionne sur la similitude entre sa langue
et celle familière aux jurés qu'il réclame, au contraire, l'article 923,
considéré isolément, n'indique pas cette raison et ne pose pas cette condition.
Au premier abord, le droit donné à l'accusé par ce dernier article paraît donc
absolu. On ne voit pas le pourquoi de cette différence. Et on s'expliquerait
encore moins les dispositions de l'article 937, où ces deux articles 923 et 924
reçoivent, sur le point, une seule et même interprétation,—interprétation
d'ordre législatif,—n'était-ce la disposition suivante d'une loi d'avant la
Confédération, demeurée en vigueur dans la province de Québec et qui, encore
plus explicitement que

[Page 295]

l'article 937 du Code, manifeste l'inexistence
de cette différence:—

Si le prévenu, lors de sa mise en accusation,
demande un jury composé, pour une moitié au moins, de personnes parlant la
langue de sa défense, si cette langue est le français ou l'anglais, il sera
jugé par un jury composé pour moitié au moins des personnes dont les noms se
trouvent successivement les premiers sur le tableau et qui lors de leur
comparution n'étant pas légalement récusées seront, d'apès l'opinion de la
cour, versées dans la langue du prévenu; (27-28 Viet. cap. 41, art. 7, para.
2).

Ce qui est sanctionné par la loi, c'est une
faculté donnée à un prévenu, dans la province de Québec, de demander à être
jugé par des jurés familiers avec la langue qu'il parle lui-même—pourvu que ce
soit le français ou l'anglais—et le droit d'obtenir alors au moins un jury
mixte si, dans la discrétion du Juge, il apparaît que les fins de la Justice
soient ainsi mieux servies qu'en faisant droit à sa demande. L'objet évident de
ces dispositions assurant à l'accusé, s'il le requiert, l'instruction de son
procès devant douze ou au moins six jurés versés dans sa langue, est qu'il
puisse facilement en suivre le cours et, alors, exercer plus adéquatement ses
droits. En somme, le droit d'un accusé de choisir un jury entièrement composé
de jurés parlant la langue française ou entièrement composé de jurés parlant la
langue anglaise n'est pas, en ce sens, un droit absolu; et le droit d'obtenir
alors un jury mixte—étant lui-même, suivant l'article 923, un droit dépendant
de l'existence du droit de choisir un jury entièrement composé de jurés de
langue française ou un jury entièrement composé de jurés de langue
anglaise—n'est lui-même absolu qu'en tant qu'un choix entre deux tels corps de
jurés soit d'abord autorisé par la loi. Disons, enfin, qu'il va de soi qu'un
accusé qui procède à cette demande peut être appelé à justifier du droit de ce
faire et qu'il appartient alors au tribunal d'adjuger sur la matière. Dans le
cas où l'accusé ne parle qu'une des deux langues officielles et dans le cas où,
parlant les deux, il est plus familier avec l'une qu' avec l'autre, il est dans
les conditions pour exercer la faculté qui lui est reconnue par cet article.
Mais, dans l'hypothèse où ces deux langues lui seraient également familières,
les dispositions de la loi n'ayant plus d'objet ne sauraient s'appliquer car,
alors, qu'un seul, que plusieurs ou que même les douze jurés soient versés dans
la langue française ou dans la langue anglaise, ou dans les deux, dans tous les
cas, le corps du jury est versé dans une langue familière à l'accusé.

[Page 296]

La jurisprudence. Je crois que c'est la
première fois que cette Cour est appelée à rendre un jugement sur le point;
mais les décisions que la Cour d'Appel de la province de Québec a été appelée à
rendre sur la question s'accordent, en substance, avec l'interprétation et les
conclusions résultant de cette analyse de la loi. Il suffit, je crois, d'en
donner la référence. Alexander v. Regem 3; Bureau v. Le Roi 4 ; Gouin v. Regem 5 ; Duval v. Le Roi 6 ; Lacasse v. Le Roi 7.

Pour ces motifs, je renverrais l'appel.

Cartwright J.:—The
appellant was convicted on a charge of manslaughter, arising out of the death
of one Denis Deslongchamps caused, as was charged, by the negligent operation
of an automobile by the appellant. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench
(Appeal Side) 8 the
conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment. Bissonnette and Casey JJ.,
dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and directed a new trial.

Special leave to appeal was not sought and our jurisdiction
is therefore restricted to a consideration of the point or points of law on
which the learned judges mentioned above differed from the majority of the
Court.

On the argument before us questions were touched on as to
the true construction of section 923  of the Criminal Code  some of which
appear to me, on further consideration, not to be raised in the dissenting
judgments. In particular I think we are not at liberty to consider whether that
section gives to an accused in the Province of Quebec who moves upon
arraignment that he be tried by a jury entirely composed of jurors speaking the
English language or entirely composed of jurors speaking the French language an
absolute right to be either tried accordingly or tried by a mixed jury, and I
wish to make it clear that I am expressing no opinion upon that question.

As I read the judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench in
this case, all the learned judges are in agreement that the right given to an
accused by subsection (2) of section 923  is limited to demanding trial by a
jury entirely composed of

[Page 297]

jurors speaking whichever of the two official languages of
the Province of Quebec is the language habitually spoken by the accused.

The learned Chief Justice deals with the question as
follows:—

D'après certaines décisions, en particulier
celle de Alexander v. Le Roi (1930) 49 B.R. 215, la demande pour un jury de
medietate linguae est comprise ou incluse dans celle d'un jury entièrement
composé de jurés parlant la même langue (anglaise ou française), et le juge qui
dans sa discrétion peut refuser la requête pour la formation d'un jury
entièrement composé de jurés parlant un seul et même langage (anglais ou
français), devait donner en l'espèce un jury mixte s'il en arrivait à la
conclusion que la langue habituelle de l'accusé était l'anglais.

En autant qu'il s'agit d'un jury mixte, il y a
lieu de retenir que la loi ne se place aucunement au point de vue de l'origine
ou de l'ascendance de l'accusé, de l'endroit de sa naissance, du milieu dans
lequel il a vécu, de la religion à laquelle il appartient. Et il en est de même
en ce qui concerne le jury.

Tout ce que l'accusé, sujet britannique, a
droit d'obtenir, c'est que six des jurés soient versés 'skilled in' dans la
langue française, six dans la langue anglaise; pour l'accusé lui-même, son
droit lui viendra de ce qu'il parle habituellement une des deux langues
reconnues au pays, la langue française ou la langue anglaise.

St. Jacques J. agrees with the Chief Justice and says in
part:—

… L'enquête qui a été faite à ce sujet le
démontre d'une façon satisfaisante, et le juge n'a pas erré en permettant que
l'enquête soit faite devant un jury de langue française, car on peut dire que
c'est la langue habituelle que parle l'inculpé.

Pratte J. who also agrees with the Chief Justice says in
part:—

Si la langue maternelle de Piperno était
l'anglais, je dirais qu'il a droit à un jury mixte, nonobstant le fait que,
depuis plusieurs années, les circonstances ont requis qu'il parlât le français
plutôt que l'anglais. Mais tel n'est pas le cas. La langue maternelle de
Piperno est l'italien. Dès son jeune âge il a appris l'anglais et le français.
A son foyer, il parle les deux langues. Mais en dehors de chez lui il parle
surtout le français depuis plusieurs années, et il ne paraît pas, au témoignage
qu'il a rendu à l'appui de sa demande, que l'anglais lui serait plus facile à
parler ou à comprendre que le français. Dans ces conditions, sa seule
affirmation que sa langue habituelle est l'anglais ne me paraît pas suffisante
pour lui donner le droit d'exiger un jury anglais ou un jury mixte.

Turning then to the dissenting judgments, Bissonette J.
opens his judgment with the words:—

Je partage entièrement l'opinion de monsieur
le juge Casey.

[Page 298]

Casey J. says in part:—

The decisions then subsequent to the Alexander case have no
bearing on the problem presented in the case at Bar, and we are left with the
rule that the accused has the right to demand that he be tried by a jury
composed exclusively of jurors speaking his language, and if this request is
refused by the trial judge, the latter is bound to order the impanelling of a
mixed jury. The next step is to determine what is the language of the defence
and the test is given by Mr. Justice Rivard in the Alexander case. At page 219 he says:—

'Ainsi qu'il a été dit dans la cause de
Yancey, the language of the defence, c'est la langue, anglaise ou
française, habituellement parlée par l'accusé.'

If I have understood their reasons correctly the question to
which all the learned judges directed their minds and on which they differed
was whether on the evidence the learned judge who presided at the trial was
right in holding that French was and English was not ""la langue
habituellement parlée par l'accusé."" It is not questioned that the
appellant's mother-tongue was Italian and that he speaks both French and
English fluently. In such circumstances the question which of the last
mentioned languages is that habitually spoken by the appellant appears to me to
be one of fact or of mixed fact and law and therefore one into which we can not
inquire.

For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

Queen (Plaintiff) Appellant;

and

Respondent.

1953: December 2, 3, 18.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Trial—Appeal—Jury’s verdict set
aside by appellate court—Crown appeals—Power of Supreme Court to restore
verdict—The Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 1024—The Supreme Court
Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 86, s. 46.

The respondent, on evidence that was wholly
circumstantial, was found guilty by a jury of unlawful assault with intent to
rob. The Ontario Court of Appeal, Hogg J.A. dissenting, set the conviction
aside on the ground that there was no evidence implicating the accused to go to
the jury. The Crown appealed on the ground that the dissenting judgment was
right in law.

Held: (Cartwright
J. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed and the order of the Court of
Appeal set aside.

Held: also,
(Kerwin J. dissenting), that an order should be made restoring the verdict of
the jury.

Per: Taschereau,
Kellock and Fauteux JJ.: The suggestion that a difference as to the person
appealing, i.e. the Crown, or an accused, calls for a distinction in law as to
this court’s powers find no support either in the enactments defining them,
(the Criminal Code , s. 1024 ; the Supreme Court Act, s. 46), or in
the judicial pronouncements interpreting such enactments, Manchuk v. the
King [1938] S.C.R. 341 at 349; Savard and Lizotte v. the King [1946]
S.C.R. 20 at 33, 39; Lizotte v. the King [1951] S.C.R. 115. Since
it does not appear that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and this court
being in as good a position to decide that question as the court below, it
should, consonant with the diligence required in the proper administration of
justice, do so.

Per: Kerwin J.
(dissenting in part). The dissent was on the question of law—whether, there was
any evidence to go to the jury. Hogg J.A. was right in holding there was, but
the majority of the Court having decided the contrary, did not determine the
question raised in the respondent’s notice of appeal, that even if there was
such evidence the verdict should be set aside as unreasonable. It had the
authority to do so whereas the jurisdiction of this court is strictly limited
and the situation on an appeal by the Crown is different from that when the
accused is the appellant and, therefore, the decision in Fraser v. the King [1936]
S.C.R. 296 is not applicable. An order should therefore go that the case be
remitted to the Court of Appeal in order that it may, if leave be given, pass
upon the point, the only one upon which the respondent is entitled to its
decision.

Cartwright J. dissenting, entertained doubts
as to the jurisdiction of this court, as it seemed to him implicit in the
reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal, that they had held the
conviction ought to be set aside under s. 1014(1)  (a) of the Criminal
Code , a ground of fact or of mixed fact and law. Dealing with the matter
however on the assumption that the sole ground of the decision of the majority
of the

[Page 4]

Court of Appeal was that there was no
evidence to go to the jury and that the ground of dissent was that there was,
he would have dismissed the appeal.

APPEAL by the Crown pursuant to the
provisions of s. 1023 (3)  of the Criminal Code  from the judgment of the
Ontario Court of Appeal[1], Hogg
J.A. dissenting, which allowed the appeal of the accused from his conviction
and directed an acquittal.

C.P. Hope, Q.C. for the appellant.

C.F. Scott for the respondent.

KERWIN J.: (dissenting in part):—After a joint
trial with a jury, the respondent McKay, and Wood and Quinlan were convicted of
having unlawfully assaulted a person with intent to rob. Wood did not appeal
and on the appeal of McKay and Quinlan, counsel for the Crown admitted that
there was no evidence to connect the latter with the offence
charged, and the Court of Appeal therefore allowed his appeal and set aside his
conviction. Judgment on McKay’s appeal was reserved and ultimately the Court of
Appeal by its judgment set aside his conviction and directed an acquittal with
Hogg J.A. dissenting. From that judgment the Crown appeals.

Having considered the reasons for judgment of
the majority, delivered by Laidlaw J.A., and those of the dissenting judge, I
am of opinion that the dissent is on the question of law whether there was any
evidence to go to the jury. I also conclude that Hogg J.A. was right in holding
that there was legal evidence against the present respondent upon which the
jury were entitled to find the respondent guilty.

In an appeal by the Crown to this Court an
accused may raise the other grounds of law taken by him before the Court of
Appeal. The respondent argued that he was at least entitled to a new trial
because of alleged defects in the trial judge’s charge to the jury but I think
there was no such defect. The trial judge put it to the jury as to whether the
respondent had access to the “hide” or secret closet, and in my opinion that
was sufficient without the necessity of referring to the question of possession
of the “hide”. It was also contended that the trial judge had charged the jury

[Page 5]

that the Crown had proven beyond any doubt that
the signatures which appear on some of certain writings were McKay’s
signatures. This is based upon the absence in the transcript of the word “no”
but, in any event it is quite clear from what immediately follows that the
trial judge was not saying that to the jury but in fact something diametrically
opposite. Finally, there is no substance in the argument that the trial judge
failed to deal adequately with the case against the respondent as distinct from
the case against Wood. The appeal should therefore be allowed and the order of
the Court of Appeal set aside.

However, in his notice of appeal to the Court of
Appeal the respondent asked leave to appeal on questions of fact. After
deciding that there was no evidence to go to the jury, the Court of Appeal did
not proceed to determine that, even if there was evidence, the verdict should
be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable. They had the authority so
to do but our jurisdiction is strictly limited. In considering the proper order
to be made on an appeal by the Crown, the situation is far different from that
when the accused is the appellant and, therefore, in my opinion the decision in
Fraser v. The King[2], is not
applicable, even though, here as there, the evidence against the accused be
purely circumstantial. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the
respondent’s application to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal on
questions of fact was granted, and the proper judgment appears to me to be to
remit the case to that Court in order that it may, if leave had been given, or
will be given, pass upon the question as to whether the verdict was
unreasonable in the light of all the evidence. That is the only point upon
which the respondent will have a right to a decision of the Court of Appeal.

The judgment of Taschereau, Kellock and Fauteux JJ.
was delivered by:—

FAUTEUX J.:—For the reasons given by my brother
Kerwin, I agree that the appeal of the Attorney General should be allowed and
the order of the Court of Appeal set aside.

With respect, however, to the order to be then
made by this Court, I think that the verdict of the jury should be restored.

[Page 6]

As to authority to make such an order, I have no
doubt. The relevant terms of s. 1024  of the Criminal Code  and of s. 46
of the Supreme Court Act are:—

1024:—The Supreme Court of Canada shall
make such rule or order thereon, either in affirmance of a conviction or for
granting a new trial, or otherwise… as the justice of the case requires.

46:—The Court may… give the judgment… which
the court whose decision is appealed against, should have given…

In Manchuk v. The King[3], Sir Lyman Duff, delivering the judgment of
the majority, said at page 349:—

There remains for consideration the grave
question as to the order that ought to be made by this Court. We have
concluded, after full consideration, that, by force of section 1024 ,
coupled with the enactments of the Supreme Court Act, this Court has
authority, not only to order a new trial, or to quash the conviction and direct
the discharge of the prisoner, but also to give the judgment which the
Court of Appeal for Ontario was empowered to give in virtue of s. 1016(2);

In Savard and Lizotte v. The King[4], Taschereau J., speaking for the majority,
stated at page 33:—

La question de droit qui donne juridiction
à cette Cour, qui en réalité la saisit du litige, est formulée par la Cour du
Banc du Roi, mais le remède qui doit être apporté, quand elle est jugée fondée,
est du ressort de cette Cour, qui peut et doit alors rendre l’ordonnance que
requiert la justice. (Manchuk v. The King3).

The view of Kellock J., on the point, is thus
expressed at page 49:—

While the existence of a dissent on a
question of law, as provided by section 1023, is a condition precedent for
an appeal to this Court, in a case like the present, this Court, once seized of
the appeal is not limited to the remedy considered appropriate in the dissent,
but has complete jurisdiction to direct the remedy which, in its opinion, the
Court appealed from ought to have granted.

In Lizotte v. The King[5], Cartwright J., delivering the judgment of
the Court, said at the bottom of page 135:—

In my opinion, once this court reaches the
conclusion, on one or more of the points properly before it, that there has
been error in law below it is unfettered in deciding what order should be made
by the views expressed in the Court of Appeal.

It is true that in each of these cases, the
appeal, contrary to what is the situation in the present instance, was entered
by the accused and not by the Crown. But the suggestion that this difference as
to the person appealing calls for a distinction in law as to the powers of this
Court finds, in

[Page 7]

my respectful view, no support, either in the
enactments defining them or in the above judicial pronouncements interpreting
such enactments.

As to the appropriateness of this order in the
present case, I am equally satisfied. The initial question which this Court had
affirmatively to answer in order to reach the conclusion that the appeal should
be allowed, was whether, contrary to the view of the majority in the Court below,
there was, in the record, legal evidence upon which a jury was entitled to find
the respondent guilty. The evidence being wholly circumstantial, the question,
in the light of the classical direction to the jury as laid down by Alderson
B., in the Hodge’s case[6],
was, more precisely, whether a jury could be satisfied “not only that those
circumstances were consistent with his having committed the act, but also that
the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion
than that the prisoner was the guilty person.”

In the consideration of the question, the
reasonableness of a verdict of guilty based upon such evidence is not, to say
the least, a foreign matter. On an exhaustive review of the evidence, it does
not appear that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable.

In this view, it would not, in my opinion, be
consonant with the diligence required in the proper administration of justice
in criminal matters to return this case to the Court of Appeal in order that it
may pass on that question, i.e., whether the verdict is unreasonable, which
this Court is in as good a position as the former to determine.

The appeal should be allowed and the verdict of
the jury restored.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The respondent was
tried jointly with one Woods and one Quinlan before Le Bel J. and a jury and
all three were convicted on the charge that “on or about the 12th of November,
1952, being armed with offensive weapons, they did unlawfully assault Gordon
Robinson, an employee of the Canadian Bank of Commerce with intent to rob him
of the property of the Bank then in his charge or custody as such employee;”

[Page 8]

The respondent and Quinlan appealed to the Court
of Appeal for Ontario. Counsel for the Crown stated that in his opinion there
was not sufficient evidence to support the verdict against Quinlan and the
Court of Appeal being of the same opinion thereupon allowed his appeal and
directed his acquittal. The Court later delivered judgment in the case of the
respondent allowing his appeal and directing his acquittal. Hogg J.A.,
dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal.

It is common ground that the evidence against
the respondent was wholly circumstantial. During the argument I entertained
doubts as to our jurisdiction, which have not been completely dispelled, as it
seemed to me to be implicit in the reasons of the majority, delivered by
Laidlaw J.A. and concurred in by Mackay J.A. that in their opinion the
conviction ought to be set aside under s. 1014(1)  (a) of the Criminal
Code , that this ground was one of fact or of mixed fact and law, and would
not be invalidated by reason of its being held, as was done by Hogg J.A., that
there was sufficient evidence for the consideration of the jury to justify the
refusal of the learned trial judge to direct a verdict of acquittal.

As, however, the majority of this Court are of
opinion that we have jurisdiction, I propose to deal with the matter on the
assumption that, as was argued by counsel for the appellant, the sole ground of
the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal was that there was no
evidence to go to the jury and that the ground of dissent was that there was
such evidence. It is too late to question the rule that whether or not there is
any evidence (as distinguished from sufficient evidence) to support a verdict
is a question of law.

On this assumption, I am of the opinion that the
appeal should be dismissed.

The learned counsel for the Crown at the trial
made it clear in his opening address that he was proceeding on the theory that
there was evidence from which the jury could properly find that, shortly after
the robbery, the respondent was, jointly with Woods, in possession of certain
articles of a highly incriminating nature (the most important being a key taken
from the bank during the robbery) which were found by the Police in “a hide”
reached through a concealed

[Page 9]

door in a closet opening off a room in the flat
of which Woods was the tenant. As I read the reasons of the Court of Appeal the
real difference between the view of the majority and that of Hogg J.A. was as
to whether there was evidence from which the jury could infer that the
respondent had joint possession of such articles.

After reviewing the relevant evidence Laidlaw
J.A. says in part:—

There was no evidence that he (the
respondent) had any rights of access to that hide, and no evidence from which
it could be found that he had possession or the right of possession, jointly or
otherwise, to it.

After a similar review Hogg J.A. says in part:—

The question before this Court is whether
the circumstances which I have outlined, furnished any evidence from which the
jury could draw an inference that the appellant had joint possession with Woods
of the aforesaid articles.

The learned Justice of Appeal goes on to decide
that there was evidence from which the jury could draw such inference.

I do not think that any useful purpose would be
served by my again reviewing the evidence. After a careful consideration of all
of it I find myself in agreement with the conclusions of the majority in the
Court of Appeal (i) that there was no evidence from which the jury could infer
that the respondent had possession of the incriminating articles in “the hide”,
and (ii) that, lacking the basis for such a finding of possession, the other
circumstances relied upon by the Crown could not be found to be inconsistent
with any other rational conclusion than that the accused was guilty.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal allowed and verdict of jury
restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE
 OF QUEBEC

Criminal Law―Evidence―Failure to charge jury
of danger of accepting evidence of perjured accomplice on a vital issue.

Where a judge fails to properly instruct a jury on the great
danger of accepting the evidence of an admittedly perjured accomplice on a
vital issue, a conviction cannot stand. The rule in Moreau v. the King [1944]
1 D.L.R. 462; 80 Can. C.C. 290 cited in Rex v. Stack and Pytell [1947]
3 D.L.R. 747 at 762; 88 Can. C.C. 320 at 327, approved.

Per: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. It
appears from the evidence in the record that a verdict of guilty by a jury
properly instructed and acting judicially would not be open to review as
unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. Therefore a new trial should be
ordered.

Per: Rand and Oartwright JJ., (dissenting in part). On
the evidence a properly instructed jury should have acquitted the accused and
therefore this court should direct that a judgment of acquittal be entered.

APPEAL from the judgment of the
Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec 1
affirming (Barclay and Hyde JJ. dissenting) the conviction of the appellant
before Girouard J. and a jury on a charge of assault with intent to do bodily
harm.

Remi Taschereau for the
appellant.

Antoine Lacourcière, Q.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.
was delivered by:―

Taschereau J.:―I
agree with my brother Cartwright that the learned trial Judge failed to
properly instruct the jury on the great danger of accepting the evidence of an
admittedly perjured accomplice on a vital issue, and that as a result of that
omission, the conviction cannot stand.

However, I would not direct a judgment of acquittal. I am
not satisfied that a verdict of guilty rendered on the evidence in the record,
by a jury properly instructed and acting judicially, would be open to review as
unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. There is I think some evidence
that must be left for the sole consideration of the jury, and I would therefore
order a new trial.

The judgment of Rand and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:—

Cartwright J.
:―This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal
Side) pronounced on the 13th of February, 1953, affirming by a majority the
conviction of the appellant, before Girouard J. and a jury, on a charge that
he, on the night of the 21st to the 22nd of July, 1951, with intent to maim or
disable Raoul Fortin or to do some other grievous bodily harm to him, did
unlawfully wound and cause grievous bodily harm to the said Raoul Fortin by
striking him on the head with a blunt instrument and causing a fracture of his
skull.

Barclay and Hyde, JJ. dissenting, would have quashed the
conviction and directed a new trial. The appeal is based, pursuant to section
1023(1)  of the Criminal Code , on their dissent on the point of law
stated in the following words in the formal judgment:―

the trial judge failed to instruct the jury on the great
danger of accepting the evidence of an admittedly perjured accomplice on a
vital issue …

[Page 54]

Two questions arise for our consideration, first whether the
verdict can stand, and secondly, if it must be set aside, whether we should
order a new trial or direct that a judgment of acquittal be entered.

The learned trial judge warned the jury in terms to which no
exception is taken of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence,
of an accomplice but he failed to give them any direction in regard to the fact
that Giroux had on two previous occasions made statements on oath which were in
direct conflict with the evidence which he had given at the trial on a vital
point.

I respectfully agree with Barclay and Hyde JJ. that, in the
circumstances of this case, the omission to direct the jury in this regard was
an error in law so serious as to require that the conviction be quashed. I do
not find it necessary to refer to all the authorities which were discussed by
counsel. I am in respectful agreement with Hyde J. that the applicable rule is
correctly stated by Errol McDougall J. who gave the judgment of the majority in
Rex v. Stack and Pytell 2 in the following words:―

Where the testimony of a principal Crown witness is in direct
conflict with a prior sworn statement made by him the trial Judge must caution
the jury in the strongest terms with respect to the danger of accepting his
evidence, and the failure to do so will necessitate a new trial,
notwithstanding that the trial Judge properly instructed the jury with respect
to the evidence of such witness in the event that they concluded that he was an
accomplice.

With the greatest respect for the contrary view entertained
by the majority in the Court of Queen's Bench I do not think that the
circumstance that counsel for the defence stressed the fact of the conflicting
statements having been made in any way absolved the learned trial judge from
the duty of dealing with them.

It remains to consider whether or not a new trial should be
directed. After an anxious perusal of the whole record I had prepared somewhat
lengthy reasons dealing with this question, referring to the evidence in
considerable detail and reaching the conclusion that we ought to direct an
acquittal. However, as the majority of the Court are of opinion that a new
trial should be ordered and it is not usual to discuss the details of the
evidence when that course is to be followed, I propose simply to state the
result at

[Page 55]

which I arrived. I am of opinion that on the evidence in
this record a properly instructed jury should have acquitted the appellant and
that therefore we should not direct a new trial.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a
judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.

Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Evidence—Conspiracy to sell, etc. narcotic
drugs—Certificates of analysts only evidence of narcotics—Whether certificates
admissible—No objection by defence—Testimony of analysts heard before Court of
Appeal—Whether Court has that power and whether it could then affirm
conviction—Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, S. of C. 1929, c. 49, s.
18—Criminal Code , ss. 1014 , 1021 .

The appellants were found by a jury to be guilty on three
charges laid under s. 573  of the Criminal Code  of conspiracy to possess,
to sell and to transmit narcotic drugs in violation of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, (S. of C. 1929, c. 49). The only proof tendered at
the trial that the substance was a narcotic drug, consisted of certificates of
two analysts. The analysts were not heard as witnesses, although one of them
was offered for cross-examination. Counsel for the accused did not at any time
object to the admission of the certificates nor to the trial judge's reference
to them in his charge as being ""conclusive evidence"" of the substance
of the narcotic drug. On appeal, the accused contended that this evidence,
although admissible under s. 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, on
a charge under that Act, was not admissible where the charge was one of
conspiracy under the Code. Thereupon, the Crown asked for, and obtained,
leave under s. 1021 of the Code to call the analysts at the hearing of
the appeal; their testimony was heard in the absence of the accused, who
declined to attend but who were represented by counsel who cross-examined the
witnesses on behalf of the accused. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba affirmed
the convictions.

By leave granted by this Court, the accused appealed on two
questions of law: (a) whether the Court of Appeal was empowered under
ss. 1014  and 1021(1)  (b) of the Criminal Code  to allow the
Crown to produce before that Court the oral evidence given by the analysts, and
(b) whether the Court of Appeal was empowered on such evidence, taken in
conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the convictions.

Held: The appeals should be dismissed and the
convictions affirmed since the Court of Appeal was justified in allowing the
taking of further evidence and in affirming the convictions (Kerwin J.,
dissenting in part, would have ordered a new trial).

Per Kerwin, Estey and Locke JJ.: The certificates were
not admissible in evidence (Desrochers v. The King, 69 C.C.C 322,
overruled). (Taschereau J. expressing no opinion on that question, and Fauteux
J. contra).

[Page 344]

Per Taschereau, Estey and Locke JJ.: In the
circumstances of this case, having considered that it was necessary or
expedient in the interests of justice to admit further evidence on a
non-controversial issue, the Court of Appeal did not infringe any principle of
law governing the exercise of the power to hear further evidence given to it by
s. 1021 (1) (b) of the Code, whose provisions are available to a
respondent as well as to an appellant.

Since there is no restriction as to the effect to be given by
the Court of Appeal to the further evidence in disposing of the appeal under s.
1014 of the Code, and since the evidence heard before the Court of
Appeal was in its nature conclusive and did not reveal new facts that might
influence a jury to come to a different conclusion, the Court of appeal
followed the proper course in confirming the convictions.

Per Fauteux J.: The additional evidence, introduced in
appeal, was not essential to legally support the verdict since the certificates
were admissible evidence of the facts therein stated, as on a true
interpretation of s. 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act the
prosecution in the present case was a prosecution under that Act. (Simcovitch
v. The King [1935] S.C.R. 26 and Robinson v. The King [1951]
S.C.R. 522 referred to). But in any event, although the failure to object to
inadmissible evidence is not always fatal, since the defence manifested a
positive intention to accept the certificates as sufficient evidence of the
facts therein stated or else opted to attempt to preserve a possible ground of
appeal, the accused cannot now raise this point; and, as there was no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin J. (dissenting in part) : The Court of
Appeal was empowered by s. 1021 (1) (b) of the Code to direct
that further evidence be taken to support the convictions of the appellants,
but it was not empowered on the evidence of the analysts taken before it and on
the evidence at the trial to affirm the convictions because it would thereby be
usurping the functions of the jury; it is impossible to say what view the jury
might have taken if they had heard the analysts and hence it cannot be said
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred within s.
1014(2) of the Code.

APPEALS from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba 1 affirming the appellants' convictions
by a jury on charges of conspiracy to sell, etc. narcotic drugs in violation of
the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929.

Harry Walsh and C. N. Kushner for the appellants. The
certificates of analysis were wholly inadmissible in evidence, they were not
proof of a drug or drugs within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act, 1929, and the jury should not have been directed that these
certificates constituted such proof and that the jury was to take the contents
of the said certificates as conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein,
since s. 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, is not applicable
to a charge of conspiracy

[Page 345]

under s. 573  of the Criminal Code . It is clear from the
wording of s. 18 of the Act, that the departure from the ordinary rules
of evidence requiring oral testimony, is only authorized in a prosecution under
that Act. It became therefore vitally necessary for the prosecution to
prove the existence of narcotic drugs within the meaning of the Act. When
the certificates are eliminated there is no proof anywhere of the existence of
a drug. The jury therefore should have been directed that there was a complete
lack of proof of the existence of any drug within the meaning of the Act.

The Court of Appeal having come to the conclusion that the
jury's verdict was unsupported by proper evidence, and that the certificates
had been improperly admitted in evidence, should have allowed the appeal under
s. 1014(1) (a) of the Code (Govin v. The King
2
and The King v. Drummond 3).

For an interpretation of what is meant by the words
""having regard to the evidence"" in s. 1014(1) (a) of the Code,
the case of R. v. Dashwood 4 is referred to.

The Court of Appeal had no power to order the examination of
the analysts before that Court. S. 1021 (1) (b) of the Code must
be interpreted as referring only to the hearing of ""newly-discovered
evidence"" or ""new evidence"" and not to evidence that was known
and that could have been produced at the trial as was the case here.
Furthermore, s. 1021 (1) (b) applies only to evidence that is brought
forward on behalf of an appellant in order to set aside the verdict of a jury,
but not to the evidence that is tendered by a respondent in order to supply
gaps in a case or to support or bolster up a verdict. All the decisions both in
England and Canada point up the fact that such evidence will not be received
unless it was such that could not have been adduced at the trial and the power
to hear fresh evidence is exercised with great caution. S. 1021  was first
passed in Canada in 1923 and is practically the same as s. 9 of the English
Criminal Appeal Act, 1907. A resume of the English decisions indicates that
the instances in which evidence is admitted before the Court of Appeal are very
limited and that, without exception, so far as can

[Page 346]

be found, it is always at the instance of the appellant in the
case that new evidence is admitted, if at all. (McGrath v. R. 5,
Thorne v. R. 6, Hyman Kurasch v. R. 7,
Warren v. R. 8, Knox v. R. 9,
Hullett v. R. 10, Allaway v. R. 11,
William Ward v. R. 12,
Mason v. R. 13,
Weisz v. R. 14, Starkie v. R. 15,
R. v. Mortimer 16, R. v. Hewitt 17, R. v. Dutt 18, R. v. McGerlymchie 19,
R. v. Livock 20
and R. v. Robinson 21). It
would be usurping the function of the jury altogether, if every time a certain
essential bit of evidence was not proved properly and by evidence properly
admissible, by the prosecution, it was permitted to the Crown respondent to
adduce that evidence before the Court of Appeal in order to have the appeal
dismissed.

A resume of the Canadian decisions also indicates that the application
can only be made by an appellant who is seeking to upset the verdict of the
jury or trial Court and cannot be invoked by a respondent in order to fill a
gap in the evidence presented to the jury. Neither the case of R. v. Feeney
22 nor R. v. Buckle 23
support the course that was adopted by the Court of Appeal in hearing the
analysts. The case of Berret v. Sainsbury 24 is
useful to show what is done in civil matters where the Court has the same power
as given by s. 1021 .

Even if the Court of Appeal did have the power to hear the
evidence of the analysts, such evidence could only be used for the purpose of
determining whether there should be a new trial or an acquittal, and could not
be used for the purpose of taking same in conjunction with the evidence given
at the trial, and then used to dismiss the appeal. The Court of Appeal should
have allowed the appeal since there was no proof adduced of any drugs within
the meaning of the Act, and then either quash the convictions or direct a new
trial (R. v. Drummond 25).

[Page 347]

S. 1014(2) of the Code cannot effect the result of a
dismissal of the appeal, since the onus is on the respondent to show that the
balance of the evidence, apart from the impugned certificates, would certainly
or inevitably result in a conviction of the appellants. Without the
certificates there cannot have been any possibility of conviction of any of the
appellants since there was then no proof of the existence of any drugs within
the meaning of the Act. (Northey v. The King 26).

A. M. Shinbane, K.C., for the respondent. The
certificates were admissible in evidence (Jacobs v. R. 27
and Desrochers v. The King 28.

The Court of Appeal was empowered to allow the respondent to
produce before that Court the oral evidence given by the analysts. S. 1021(1) (b)
of the Code gives it that power. This section corresponds substantially
to s. 9 of the English Criminal Appeal Act, 1907. But the Court of
Criminal Appeal has no jurisdiction to direct a new trial and this limitation
of power in some measure at least accounts for the reluctance of that Court to
allow evidence to be called which might have been heard at the trial. (R. v.
Mason 29). Almost all the reported cases deal
with ""fresh"" or ""new"" evidence. Here the evidence was
merely supplementary and confirmatory. Inasmuch as the form in which their
evidence was tendered was to be considered faulty, the analysts were called
merely to confirm the accuracy of their analyses, the introduction of which as
evidence and the reference thereto were not at any time objected to by the
defence at any stage of the trial. But under s. 1021 , the evidence may
be of a character other than ""new"" or ""fresh"".

Although the omission by the defence to object does not
prevent the defence from raising the objection in the Court of Appeal,
nevertheless that omission was a circumstance properly to be considered by the
Court. It indicated that the defence either shared in the mistake of the
prosecution and the Court, or believed that the accused was not substantially
prejudiced by the erroneous form in which the proof of drugs was put before the
jury. More so in this case when the notice of appeal arguing that the
certificates were

[Page 348]

not admissible was filed the day after the verdict was
rendered and on the same day that sentence was passed. (R. v. Stirland
30
and R. v. Cutter 31).

The power and the practice of the Court of Appeal in respect
of fresh or new evidence not tendered at the trial may be summarized thus: (a)
The Court has power to admit it; (b) It is a power which must always be
exercised with great care; (c) The Court will not lay down any
definition of what will constitute exceptional or special circumstances; (d)
The Court will allow evidence to be given which might have been given at
the trial, if it is satisfied that the omission was due to a misunderstanding,
inadvertence or mistake. (R. v. Robinson 32, R.
v. Weisz 33, R. v. Hullett 34,
R. v. Warren 35, R. v. Knox 36
and R. v. Collins 37.

Furthermore, that section is a remedial provision and there is
no ambiguity in its language. (R. v. Robinson et al 38
and R. v. McTemple 39.

The Court of Appeal was empowered on the evidence of the
analysts taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to confirm the
convictions, as there was then such overwhelming evidence of guilt that no
reasonable jury on a proper direction could or would have failed to convict the
appellants, and there was therefore no miscarriage of justice. The converse of
the principle in R. v. Gach 40
is applicable to the present case, and the Court of Appeal was authorized to
dismiss the appeal by ss. 1014, 1021 of the Code, and by the provisions
of the Court of Appeal Act of Manitoba. Because fresh evidence or further or
additional evidence is admitted on appeal, it does not follow that the case
must be sent back for a new trial (R. v. Feeney 41 and R.
v. Buckle 42.

The accused had a trial by jury, because, apart from anything
else, there was ample evidence to support the verdict as found out by the Court
of Appeal, and therefore there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice.

[Page 349]

Kerwin J.
(dissenting in part):—The four appellants were found by a jury to be guilty on
three counts of an indictment charging conspiracies to commit indictable
offences, i.e., to unlawfully sell drugs, to unlawfully possess drugs, and to
unlawfully cause drugs to be taken or carried from one place to another in
Canada—all within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, as
amended, without first having obtained a licence. Convictions were entered and
sentences imposed. From these convictions they appealed to the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba (1) and during the hearing of their appeals the Crown applied to
be allowed to produce before the Court of Appeal, in support of the convictions,
the evidence of two analysts who had certified that certain material sold,
possessed, or taken or carried, was a narcotic drug within the meaning of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act. The certificates had been put in evidence as if the
prosecutions had been under that Act instead, as was the fact, for
conspiracies under section 573  of the Criminal Code . The evidence of the
sale, possession, taking or carrying was given as part of the evidence upon
which the charges of conspiracy were based.

The Court of Appeal 43 granted the Crown's
application and the evidence of the analysts was taken. Upon that evidence and
the evidence at the trial, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of the
accused. By leave granted under subsection 1 of section 1025 of the Code as
enacted by section 42 of chapter 39 of the 1948 Statutes, the accused appeal to
this Court on the following questions of law:

(1) On the appellants' appeal from their conviction was
the Court of Appeal for Manitoba empowered under sections 1014  and 1021 (1)  (b)
of the Criminal Code  or otherwise to allow the respondent to produce
before that Court the oral evidence actually given?

(2) If so, was that Court empowered, on such evidence
taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction, or
was it authorized merely to order a new trial?

[Page 350]

As to the first point, section 1021 (1) (b) of the Code
is in the following terms:

1021. For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the
court of appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interest of
justice

. . .

(b) if it thinks fit, order any witnesses who would
have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend and be examined before
the court of appeal, whether they were or were not called at the trial, or
order the examination of any such witnesses to be conducted in manner provided
by rules of court before any judge of the court of appeal, or before any
officer of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person
appointed by the court of appeal for the purpose, and allow the admission of
any deposition so taken as evidence before the court of appeal; and

exercise in relation to the proceedings of the court of
appeal any other powers which may for the time being be exercised by the court
of appeal on appeals in civil matters, and issue any warrants necessary for
enforcing the orders or sentences of the court of appeal.

It is contended that by the words ""For the purposes of
an appeal under this Part"", Parliament never intended to give the Crown,
on an accused's appeal, the right to ask, or to give the Court the right to
permit, that evidence be heard in support of the conviction of the appellant,
particularly when the trial had been with a jury. Emphasis is placed upon
section 1014 of the Code which provides that on the hearing of an appeal
against conviction the Court of Appeal shall allow the appeal if it is of
opinion

(a) that the verdict of the jury should be set aside
on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to
the evidence; or

(b) that the judgment of the trial court should be
set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law;

It is said that the convictions cannot be supported on the
evidence because without the certificates there was no evidence that the material
in question was a drug within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act. Testimony was given at the trial by which, the Crown contends, the
jury would have been entitled to find that it was such a drug. The Court of
Appeal evidently felt that proposition to be doubtful because, if it were
sound, there would have been no occasion to order the taking of the evidence of
the analysts. Presuming in the meantime that this is so, the question is
squarely raised as to the power of the Court of Appeal to make the order.

[Page 351]

We are told that no Canadian case can be found where
evidence was taken before the Court of Appeal to support a conviction. Reliance
is placed upon the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Drummond 44, where it was
held that on a charge of perjury committed at the trial of an indictment, such
trial and the indictment, verdict and judgment therein must be proved as
matters of record and this not having been done, the conviction was set aside.
It is to be noted that that part of section 1021  quoted above was first enacted
by section 9 of chapter 41 of the Statutes of 1923, so that at the time of the Drummond decision there was no power in the Court of Appeal
to receive further evidence. In another case, which was not referred to, Rex
v. Ivall 45, the Ontario Court of Appeal ordered a
new trial on a charge that the accused removed a child under the age of
fourteen years from the custody of the Children's Aid Society where, on the
first trial, the child's age had not been proved. No application was made for
leave to produce the evidence before the Court of Appeal.

The 1923 Act was taken from the Criminal Appeal Act of
England, 1907, and no decisions have been found in England in which the
Crown was given leave to do as was done here. In Rex v. Robinson 46,
an application was made by the Crown to introduce evidence that arose after the
conviction and therefore could not have been called at the trial, but this was
on the basis that such evidence would have a material bearing on the accused's
application for leave to appeal from a conviction in view of the fact that one
of the grounds stated in the application for leave was that the verdict was
against the weight of the evidence and in those circumstances one question that
would have to be considered was whether there had been any substantial
miscarriage of justice. The evidence admitted was a letter written by the
accused in which he admitted the act which it was alleged constituted murder.

The case does show that further evidence will be admitted
although there it was of something that occurred after the trial. However, the
ground of the decision was the provision in the Criminal Appeal Act that
the Court of Criminal Appeal may exercise in relation to the proceedings in

[Page 352]

the Court any other powers which might for the time being be
exercised by the Court of Appeal in appeals on civil matters. Considering the
similar provisions of section 1021 , it appears to me that they are sufficient
to empower the Court of Appeal to direct that further evidence be taken.

On the argument, the attention of counsel was directed to
the decision of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of
Quebec in Desrochers v. The King 47. That
decision was not referred to before the Manitoba Court of Appeal 48
or on the application for leave to appeal to this Court. There, the accused
were charged under section 573  of the Criminal Code  with having
conspired to commit an indictable offence under The Excise Act, 1934 By
section 113 of that Act: ""In every prosecution under this Act, the
certificate of analysis … shall be accepted as prima facie evidence"";
and in the French version: Dans toute poursuite en vertu de la présente loi, le
certificat d'analyse … est accepté comme prima facie. It was held that a
certificate was admissible by virtue of that section in the prosecution of the
charge of conspiracy under the Code.

Section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, enacts:
""In any prosecution under this Act a certificate as to the analysis of any
drug or drugs … shall be prima facie evidence."" The
French version reads: ""Dans toute poursuite instituée sous le régime de la
présente loi, un certificat relatif à l'analyse d'une drogue ou de drogues, …
constitue une preuve prima facie"". For present purposes,
this section, in either version, may be taken to bear the same meaning as
section 113 of The Excise Act, 1934, in either version. The present
proceeding not being a prosecution under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, section
18 thereof is inapplicable and the decision in Desrochers on that point
should be overruled.

Section 28 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927,
chapter 1, reads as follows:

28. Every Act shall be read and construed as if any offence
for which the offender may be

(a) prosecuted by indictment, howsoever such offence
may be therein described or referred to, were described or referred to as an
indictable offence;

[Page 353]

(b) punishable on summary conviction, were described
or referred to as an offence ; and all provisions of the Criminal Code  relating
to indictable offences, or offences, as the case may be, shall apply to every
such offence.

That section was considered by this Court in Simcovitch v.
The King 49 in conjunction with section 69  of the Criminal
Code  by which anyone is a party to and guilty of an offence who ""(d)
counsels or procures any person to commit the offence."" It was held
that one who counselled a bankrupt to commit an offence specified in section
191 of the Bankruptcy Act was by the combined operation of section 28 of
the Interpretation Act and section 69 of the Code guilty of an
offence under section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act although that section,
by its terms, referred only to a person having been a bankrupt or in respect of
whose estate a receiving order has been made, or who had made an authorized
assignment under the Bankruptcy Act. That decision can have no
application here because, within the terms of section 28 of the Interpretation
Act, there is no provision of the Criminal Code  which it is suggested
might be made applicable. On the contrary, the suggestion is that on a
prosecution under the Code a certificate of analysis is to be taken as prima
facie evidence merely because section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug
Act states that in any prosecution under that Act a certificate is
to be so treated. With respect I can find no justification for reading the
enactment in that manner.

It was argued that there was sufficient evidence without the
certificates but it must be borne in mind that having admitted them, the trial
judge instructed the jury that they were conclusive. I am not now dealing with
a situation where, on a charge of conspiring to commit an indictable offence
under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, the evidence of such conspiracy
is based upon something other than the actual commission of an offence itself.
What is relied upon in the present case to prove the conspiracy are specific
acts, and the circumstances that witnesses testified at the trial that the
article dealt with was heroin and that the accused, or some of them, so
designated it to those witnesses, are not sufficient. If articles be sold which
were mere substitutes for a narcotic and not within the class of specified
drugs, there would be no offence. On the other

[Page 354]

hand, the gist of an offence under section 573 of the Code
is the conspiracy itself, and in a proper case a jury might find that a
conspiracy existed to sell a specified narcotic without first having obtained a
licence.

In my opinion the second question raises a question of law
and the Court of Appeal was not empowered on the evidence of the analysts taken
before it and on the evidence at the trial to affirm the conviction because it
would thereby usurp the functions of the jury. It is not a matter of interfering
with a discretion exercised by the Court of Appeal since it is impossible to
say what view a jury might take if they had the analysts before them and hence
it cannot be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage had occurred within
section 1014(2) of the Code.

The appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

Taschereau J.:—The
appellants were jointly charged on four counts of conspiracy to violate the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, and were found guilty on three.

At trial, the respondent filed certificates of analysis to
establish that the drugs which were possessed and sold by the appellants, were
heroine, a drug within the meaning of the Act, but the analysts
themselves were not heard. Section 18 of the Act is to the effect that
""in any prosecution under the Act"", such certificates signed by a
Dominion analyst, constitute prima facie evidence of the facts therein
stated.

Before the Court of Appeal 50, the appellants
submitted that, not having been prosecuted under the Act, but for
conspiracy under the Criminal Code , the certificates were illegal
evidence, and that the analysts should have been called. The Court of Appeal 51
obviously agreed with this contention, for at the request of the respondent, it
received the evidence of the analysts and unanimously confirmed the conviction.
Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by Mr. Justice Kerwin on the two
following questions of law:

(1) Was the Court of Appeal empowered under section
1014 and 1021 (1) and (b) of the Code or otherwise, to allow the respondent
to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually given?

[Page 355]

(2) If so, was the Court empowered on such evidence
taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction or
was it authorized merely to order a new trial?

If a prosecution for conspiracy to possess and sell
heroine, is a prosecution under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, the
conviction was valid, and the Court of Appeal did not need to hear new
evidence; but in view of the conclusion which I have reached, I do not think it
necessary to determine this question.

Section 1021  (b) of the Criminal Code  is as follows:

1021. For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the
court of appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interest of
justice.

(b) if it thinks fit, order any witnesses who
would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend and be examined
before the court of appeal, whether they were or were not called at the
trial, or order the examination of any such witnesses to be conducted in manner
provided by rules of court before any judge of the court of appeal, or before
any officer of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person
appointed by the court of appeal for the purpose, and allow the admission of
any deposition so taken as evidence before the court of appeal;

As to the power of the Court of Appeal to hear fresh
evidence, I have no doubt, if any meaning is to be given to section 1021 (b),
which states that ""for the purposes of the appeal"", witnesses may be
examined before the court. It is obviously in order to enable the court to
properly determine the case, that such a power is conferred, and these plain
words used by the legislator must be given effect to. Otherwise, the section
would be nugatory, and Parliament's expressed intentions would be defeated.

This section corresponds substantially to section 9(b)
of the English Criminal Appeal Act 1907. It has been held in England that this
authority to hear new evidence must be used with ""great care"" and in
""exceptional circumstances"" only, and I think that the rule here is
the same. (Rex v. Mason) 52 ; (Rex v. Rowland)
53.
A too liberal exercise of this power would undoubtedly conflict with the
economy of our criminal law, would in certain instances give the Crown a second
chance to make a case which it has failed to make at trial, and could possibly
also invest a court of appeal with powers exclusively within the province of
the jury.

[Page 356]

But in the case at bar, in view of the special
circumstances, I think that the Court of Appeal was right in granting the
application made by the Crown to hear the analysts. The accuracy of the facts
contained in the certificates were not an issue before the jury, and all
parties seemed to agree that the drug had been properly proved. Although the
failure of counsel for the defence to object to illegal evidence, cannot as a
rule be considered as fatal, it is important to note in the present case, that
he declined to cross-examine one of the analysts who was present at the trial,
and offered by the Crown. The Court of Appeal merely corrected an error upon
which the jury acted, and as Dysart J. said, it has put the case in exactly the
position in which the jury believed it to be, when they convicted the accused.

Under section 1014, Cr. Code, the Court
of Appeal could confirm or order a new trial, and I think that it followed the
proper course in adopting the former. The fresh evidence was in its nature
conclusive and did not reveal new facts that might influence a jury in coming
to a conclusion.

I would dismiss the appeals.

Estey J.:—The
appellants, whose conviction for conspiracy contrary to s. 573  of the Criminal
Code  was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 54, have,
by way of a further appeal, been granted leave, under s. 1025  of the Criminal
Code  as amended in 1948 (S. of C. 1948, c. 39, s. 42 ), to submit two
questions of law to this Court:

""(1) On the Appellants' appeal from their
conviction was the Court of Appeal for Manitoba empowered under sections 1014 
and 1021 (1)  (b) of the Criminal Code  or otherwise to allow the
Respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually given?

(2) If so, was that Court empowered, on such evidence
taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction, or
was it authorized merely to order a new trial?""

These appellants were charged upon four counts of conspiracy
to unlawfully (a) sell, (b) possess, (c) cause to be taken
and (d) distribute, drugs within the meaning of

[Page 357]

The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and thereby to
have committed an offence contrary to the provisions of s. 573  of the Criminal
Code . At their trial before a judge and jury they were found guilty of (a),
(b) and (c).

The Crown established the conspiracy by adducing evidence of
specific instances of selling, possessing and causing to be taken, drugs
contrary to The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. As proof of the fact that
the commodity dealt with in each instance was a narcotic drug, ten certificates
of analysis were placed in evidence without objection. Counsel for the Crown,
in tendering these certificates, was under the impression that they were
admissible by virtue of the provisions of s. 18 of The Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act. This impression was concurred in by the learned trial judge. S.
18 reads as follows:

18. In any prosecution under this Act a certificate as to
the analysis of any drug or drugs signed or purporting to be signed by a
Dominion or provincial analyst shall be prima facie evidence of the
facts stated in such certificate and conclusive evidence of the authority of
the person giving or making the same without any proof of appointment or
signature.

The learned judges in the Court of Appeal held that the
provisions of s. 18 had no application to a trial for conspiracy under s. 573 
of the Criminal Code  and that the ten certificates prepared by the
analysts were improperly received. The learned judges, however, were of the
opinion that this was an appropriate case in which to hear viva voce evidence
of the analysts under the authority of s. 1021 (1)  (b) of the Criminal
Code :

1021. For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the
court of appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interest of
justice.

. . .

(b) if it thinks fit,
order any witnesses who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to
attend and be examined before the court of appeal, whether they were or were
not called at the trial, or order the examination of any such witnesses to be
conducted in manner provided by rules of court before any judge of the court of
appeal, or before any officer of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or
other person appointed by the court of appeal for the purpose, and allow the
admission of any deposition so taken as evidence before the court of appeal; …

and exercise in relation to the proceedings of the court of
appeal any other powers which may for the time being be exercised by the court
of appeal on appeals in civil matters, and issue any warrants necessary for
enforcing the orders or sentences of the court of appeal.

[Page 358]

Messrs. Jones and Blanchard, who had prepared these
certificates, were accordingly called as witnesses before the Court of Appeal
and there gave evidence to the same effect as set out in their respective
certificates.

S. 1021 (1)  (b) was enacted by Parliament in 1923 and
is to the same effect as s. 9(b) of the Court of Criminal Appeal Act in
Great Britain (1907, 7 Edw. VII, c. 23). In the Court of Criminal Appeal the
corresponding English s. 9(b) was commented upon as follows:

Undoubtedly the Legislature has armed this Court with the
widest possible powers for the purposes of investigation, and in a proper case
this Court would not refuse to make use of the powers which are contained in
these paragraphs of s. 9.

Rex v. Thorne 55.

Parliament has indicated what is ""a proper case""
by expressly providing that the wide powers under s. 1021 (1)  (b) shall
be exercised only where the court of appeal ""thinks it necessary or
expedient in the interest of justice."" Under this provision it has been
repeatedly held, as stated by the learned author of Archibald's Cr.
Pl., Ev. & P., 32nd Ed., p. 309, that

The Court will only act upon this power in very special
circumstances.

which, as pointed out by the Lord Chief Justice in Rex
v. Weisz 56, ""they had been careful not to
define."" A similar view is expressed in Rex v. MacTemple 57.
It, therefore, appears that if a court of appeal has concluded that the
circumstances are exceptional and directed the reception of the evidence its
decision should not be disturbed, unless, in arriving at its conclusion, it has
acted contrary to principle.

The learned judges of the Court of Appeal deemed the
circumstances here sufficiently special that, in the interest of justice, the
evidence of the analysts should be heard. It is an unusual case. Apart from a
statutory provision, such evidence as we are here concerned with can only be
received viva voce. S. 18 is enacted as part of, and is applicable only
""in any prosecution under,"" The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. Such
a provision has no application to a prosecution for an offence under s. 573  of
the Criminal Code . In so far as Desrochers v. The King 58,

[Page 359]

may be contrary to this view, it must be overruled. S. 28 of
the Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 1), which makes certain
provisions of the Criminal Code  applicable to other statutes, does not
make the provisions of those other statutes applicable to prosecutions under
the Criminal Code  and, therefore, does not assist the prosecution upon
this appeal.

We were informed that these certificates were placed in
evidence at the preliminary without objection. Then, when counsel for the
Crown, prior to the trial, decided that it was unnecessary for him to call all
the witnesses who could depose to the relevant facts, he prepared a list of
these, together with a summary of their evidence, and submitted it to counsel
for the appellant, with a request that if he desired any of these witnesses to
be called for the purpose of cross-examination that he so advise him. This list
included Jones, one of the analysts, who had prepared some of these
certificates. Counsel for the appellant replied that he desired that only one
Porter, whose evidence was not upon any question relative to the analysis of
the commodities, be alone produced for cross-examination. All of this was
explained before the presiding judge and appears in the record of the trial, in
part, as follows:

THE COURT: Your answer is, you don't wish him to call any
except Porter?

Mr. KUSHNER: I don't wish any witness called for the purpose
of cross-examination, other than Inspector Porter.

The failure of counsel for the defence to object to the
reception of inadmissible evidence does not, in general, constitute a bar to
the objection thereto in an appellate court, nor would it alone justify a court
of appeal in exercising its powers under s. 1021 (1)  (b). It is,
however, an important circumstance in this case because it corroborates what
was evidenced throughout the trial that the main contentions of the defence
were not directed to whether the substances were narcotic drugs within the
meaning of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. In Stirland v. Director
of Public Prosecutions 59, Viscount Simon stated:

… the court must be careful in allowing an appeal on the ground
of reception of inadmissible evidence when no objection has been made at the
trial by the prisoner's counsel. The failure of counsel to object may have a
bearing on the question whether the accused was really prejudiced.

[Page 360]

Even if the certificates had been admissible under s. 18,
they were only prima facie evidence of their contents and if counsel for
the appellant had intended to raise any question as to their correctness or the
weight of the statements contained therein he would have, upon receipt of the
request from counsel for the Crown, asked that at least Jones be called for
cross-examination.

The certificates, though inadmissible, were received at and
accepted throughout the trial as evidence of the facts therein set out. The
Court of Appeal, under s. 1021 (1)  (b), permitted these facts to be
placed in evidence by the calling of the witnesses Jones and Blanchard, who had
made the analyses and prepared the certificates and who deposed to the same
facts as set out in the certificates. In effect, the same facts are now
repeated in the record, but in a form admissible in law. Under these
circumstances the Court of Appeal, in concluding, in the interests of justice,
that the additional evidence should be received, has violated no principle and
has acted within its power under s. 1021 (1) 

The contention of counsel for the appellant that the Court
of Appeal had no power to receive the evidence of Jones and Blanchard, because
in neither case was the evidence ""newly discovered"" or ""new
evidence"" unknown to the Crown at the time of the trial, is not tenable.
In support of his contention he cited a statement of Lord Chief Justice Goddard
in Rex v. McGrath 60, which had reference to the
disposition of the case when previously before the court and was not essential
to the decision of the case which was now before the court upon a reference by
the Secretary of State under s. 19(a), where, as pointed out in Rex v.
Collins 61, different considerations obtain.
Moreover, counsel, in his submission, would construe s. 1021 (1)  (b) as
equivalent to the rule in civil cases for the granting of a new trial and the
reception of further evidence. The language of s. 1021 (1)  (b) does not
support this submission. The incorporation of the reference to ""appeals in
civil matters"" follows and is in addition, or supplementary, to the powers
set out in subpara. (b) of

[Page 361]

1021(1). Moreover, neither in England nor in Canada has this
provision been so construed. Rex v. Dutt 62; Rex
v. Warren 63 ; Rex v. Hullett 64
; Rex v. Allaway 65; Rex v. Ward 66;
Rex v. Mason 67; Rex v. Knox 68 ; Rex
v. MacTemple 69 ; Rex v. Buckle 70.

The further submission of counsel for the appellant, that
the provisions of s. 1021 (1)  (b) are applicable only in support of an
appellant who seeks to set aside a verdict of guilty, is not tenable. The
comprehensive language of the section is such as to make it applicable to both
the defence and the Crown and had Parliament intended any such limitation as
here suggested it would have adopted apt language to give expression thereto.
Moreover, in Rex v. Robinson 71, where the accused
appealed, the Crown was granted leave to call further evidence. The facts of
the case are quite different, but it does support the view that the provisions
of the section are available to the Crown as well as the defence. The section,
as already stated, gives wide powers to a court of appeal, to be exercised only
where that court properly concludes that the evidence should be received in the
interest of justice.

The second question assumes the power of the court of appeal
to hear the evidence, but suggests that, having done so, it is authorized
merely to order a new trial. There does not appear to be, nor was our attention
directed to, any provision in s. 1021 (1)  (b), or elsewhere, to
the effect that the reception of evidence under that section by a court of
appeal limits or restricts that court in its disposition of the appeal under s.
1014 . On the contrary, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  rather
contemplate that the evidence so received shall form a part of the record and
be considered along with the evidence taken at the trial. If the court of
appeal finds that there are reasons within s. 1014(1)  (a), (b)
and (c) to allow the appeal, it will do so, but, if not, then under
s. 1014(1)  (d) it will dismiss the appeal. The Court of Appeal
was of the opinion that this case did not come under s. 1014(1)  (a),

[Page 362]

(b) or (c), but under s. 1014(1) (d),
and, therefore, dismissed the appeal. Dysart J.A., speaking on behalf of
the Court, stated:

In the present case the fresh evidence is as nearly
conclusive as oral testimony can be. It is directed to only one point—the
scientific analysis of the material which the prosecution charges was a
narcotic drug; and it proves beyond any doubt that the material was a narcotic
within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. The evidence is of
highly competent analysts; it has no internal weakness or defect, and is not
contradicted nor challenged by any other evidence in the case.

This evidence was to precisely the same effect as the facts
set forth in the certificates. In cross-examination the witnesses were asked as
to the possibility of mistake or error, but their answers were such that this
contention was not pressed. What was attained by the calling of these witnesses
was the placing in the record, in a form admissible as evidence, facts which
erroneously had been treated as properly before the court at the trial. As
such, they were passed upon by the jury. In effect, it was, therefore, a change
in form rather than substance upon an issue in respect of which contentions
were not raised at the trial. No reason is suggested why a jury, acting
judicially, would not have come to the same conclusion.

In my opinion the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be
affirmed and the appeal dismissed.

Locke J.:—The
charge against the appellants in respect to the offence of conspiring to sell
narcotic drugs was:

That they, the said John Kissick, Peter Kissick, William
Kissick and Stella (Sally) Smallwood … conspired with each other and with other
persons unknown to commit an indictable offence, to wit: to unlawfully sell
drugs, within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and
amendments thereto, without first having obtained a licence from the Minister
of National Health and Welfare or other lawful authority.

The charges as to the offences of possessing, carrying and
distributing narcotic drugs were expressed in similar terms.

The offences created by section 4 of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act 1929 are indictable. Section 573  of the Criminal Code  provides
that:

Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
seven years' imprisonment who, in any case not hereinbefore provided for,
conspires with any person to commit any indictable offence.

[Page 363]

and it was under this section of the Code that
these proceedings were taken.

Section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act provides
that:

In any prosecution under this Act a certificate as to the
analysis of any drug or drugs signed or purporting to be signed by a Dominion
or provincial analyst shall be prim facie evidence of the facts stated
in such certificate and conclusive evidence of the authority of the person
giving or making the same without any proof of appointment or signature.

On the assumption that this section might be invoked in a
prosecution for conspiracy, ten certificates, certain of which were signed by
J. B. Jones and others by J. F. Blanchard, both Dominion analysts, were
tendered and received in evidence at the trial as proof of the fact that the
drugs said to have been sold by certain of the appellants were substances
mentioned in the schedule to the Act. Neither of the analysts gave oral
evidence. In advance of the hearing, however, counsel for the Crown had advised
counsel for the accused that there were eleven witnesses whose evidence would
be merely corroborative, these including the name of the analyst Jones, whom
the Crown did not propose to call, unless the defence wished any of them to be
called for the purpose of cross-examination, and was advised that they did not
wish Jones and others to be called for this purpose. The name of Blanchard was
not included in the list. In charging the jury Mr. Justice Montague instructed
them that they were to give full credence to the certificates and that the
facts stated in them were to be taken as ""proven conclusively"" and no
objection was made by counsel for any of the prisoners to this or any other
portion of the charge. The learned trial judge directed the jury to acquit the
appellants of the fourth of the charges, namely, that of conspiring to
distribute narcotic drugs, and of the three other charges they were all found
guilty and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.

The present appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba 72, serving their notice on the day they
were sentenced and raising amongst other grounds the contention that the
certificates were inadmissible, since the prosecution was not under the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act. During the hearing of the appeal counsel for the

[Page 364]

Crown applied for leave to adduce oral evidence in support
of the conviction and orders were made that the evidence of the analyst Jones
be taken before the Court of Appeal, and that of the analyst Blanchard, who was
ill at the time, before Mr. Justice Adamson. The accused disclaimed any wish to
be present during these proceedings but they were represented by counsel who
cross-examined the witnesses on their behalf. In the result the convictions
were affirmed and the appeals dismissed.

The present appeal has been taken pursuant to special leave
granted by Kerwin J. and by whose order the questions of law to be determined
are thus stated:

""1. On the appellants' appeal from their
conviction was the Court of Appeal for Manitoba empowered under sections 1014 
and 1021(1)  (b) of the Criminal Code , or otherwise, to allow the
respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually given?

2. If so, was that Court empowered on such evidence,
taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction, or
was it authorized merely to order a new trial?""

Section 1013  of the Criminal Code  grants a right of
appeal to the Court of Appeal to a person convicted on indictment in certain
defined circumstances, and subsection 4 of that section, introduced into the Act
in 1930, allows an appeal by the Crown from a verdict of acqittal on any
ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone. The powers of the
Court for disposing of such appeals are defined by section 1014 . Section 1021 
provides in part as follows:

For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the court of
appeal may if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interests of justice,

. . .

(b) if it thinks fit,
order any witnesses who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to
attend and be examined before the court of appeal, whether they were or were
not called at the trial, or order the examination of any such witnesses to be
conducted in manner provided by rules of court before any judge of the court of
appeal or justice of the peace or other person appointed by the court of appeal
for the purpose, and allow the admission of any deposition so taken as evidence
before the court of appeal;

and exercise in relation to the proceedings of the court of
appeal any other powers which may for the time being be exercised by the court
of appeal on appeals in civil matters, …

[Page 365]

By the Court of Appeal Act, c. 40, R.S.M. 1940,
section 27, it is provided that the court upon any appeal, may give any
judgment which ought to have been pronounced and make such further or other
order as is deemed just, and by subsection 3 that:

the Court shall have full discretionary power to receive
further evidence upon questions of fact by oral examination in court, by
affidavit, or by declaration taken before an examiner or a commissioner.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal proceeded on the basis
that the certificates of the analysts were not admissible in evidence and the
application made on behalf of the Crown would indicate that this position was
accepted by counsel on its behalf. On the argument before us, however, counsel
for the Crown contended that section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act,
1929, applied to a prosecution such as this and that accordingly the facts
disclosed in the certificates of analysis were proven. If this contention could
be sustained, it would, of course, be unnecessary to deal with either of the
questions submitted. In my opinion, the certificates were not admissible and
the fact that the substances dealt in by the appellants were narcotic drugs,
within the meaning of the Act, was not proven. The offence for which the
accused were indicted was not that of committing any of the offences enumerated
in the Act of which section 18 forms a part, but rather the offence of
conspiring with others to commit such an offence, a conspiracy declared to be
indictable by section 573  of the Criminal Code . The opening words of
section 18  are ""in any prosecution under this Act"" and there could be
no prosecution under that Act for acts declared to be an offence by a
section of the Criminal Code  and not elsewhere in any statute relating
to the criminal law. To invoke section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act
in a prosecution such as this would be to import a section of that Act into
the Criminal Code , and for this I find no warrant anywhere.

In ordering the taking of further evidence the Court of
Appeal has acted in the exercise of the discretion vested in it by section 1021 
and the determination of the first question requires us to decide whether, in
so doing, it has acted upon the proper principle (Brown v. Dean) 73.
The relevant portions of section 1021 , while not verbatim, are

[Page 366]

indistinguishable from the corresponding portions
of section 9 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1907 of England. There it
may be noted the court is not empowered to order a new trial. In Rex v. Mason
74
17 C.A.R. 161, Darling J., in delivering the judgment of the court on an
application to adduce further evidence, said in part:

It is now really asked that there should be a new trial,
which this Court is not empowered to order, and that we should hear certain
witnesses whose names have been mentioned, and then consider the whole of the
trial in the light of that new evidence. This Court exercises with very great
caution the power given it to hear fresh evidence because to do so is opposed
to the old established, trusted and cherished institution of trial by jury.
This Court has to be convinced of very exceptional circumstances before it will
reconsider the verdict of a jury in the light of fresh evidence which has not
been laid before the jury, and which, in some cases, might have been put before
the jury at the trial.

As to the evidence of proposed witnesses who were available
but not called at the trial, to the same effect is the judgment of that court
in Rex v. Hatch 75. In some cases such as Rex v. Warren
76,
where the witness was not called at the trial, due to a misunderstanding,
evidence has been received in the Court of Appeal but where, as in Rex v.
Weisz 77, on the appeal of the prisoner an
application was made to give the evidence of a woman who had been absent from
England at the time of the trial, Reading C.J., in refusing the application,
said that the appellant's legal advisers knew the case they would have to meet
and no application was made to adjourn the trial, that there was no surprise
and that the policy was deliberate of resting the defence upon the available
evidence. These were all cases where the appellant was the prisoner but in Rex
v. Robinson 78, where a prisoner applied for leave to
appeal, the Crown asked leave to put in further evidence, being a letter
written by the prisoner since his conviction in which he admitted committing the
offence, and this was permitted under the provisions of section 9 of the Act.

In Rex v. Collins 79,
further evidence was received on the appeal because the reference had been made
to the court by the Home Secretary who wanted the court to deal with it, but
Goddard L.C.J. pointed out the risk of allowing

[Page 367]

such evidence after conviction and the reason why it is not
done, save in exceptional circumstances, in these terms:

The danger of allowing further evidence to be called after
conviction, and the reason why the Court does not allow it save in exceptional
circumstances, is clear enough. It is very easy after a person has been
convicted to find witnesses who are willing to come forward and say this, that,
or the other thing. If further evidence were allowed in such circumstances, it
could always be said: ""If this evidence had been given at the trial, it
does not follow that the jury would have convicted, or they might not have
convicted."" That is especially true in cases where the defence is an alibi.
Two or three witnesses perhaps are called to establish an alibi, which the jury
reject. It is very often not difficult after conviction to find another witness
or perhaps two more witnesses who would be willing to come and support the
alibi, and it can always be said: ""If only the prisoner had had the
evidence of A or B which is now tendered, the jury might have come to a
different decision, and the prisoner should have the benefit of that
possibility."" That is one of the reasons why this Court is necessarily
reluctant to allow further evidence to be called after conviction.

Some further light on the construction which has been placed
upon the English Statute by the court is afforded by the judgment in Rex v.
Rowland 80, where, on an appeal against a conviction
on a charge of murder, an application was made on behalf of the appellant for
leave to call as a witness a man who, since the trial of the appellant,
confessed that he himself had committed the murder of which the appellant had
been convicted. Humphreys J., delivering the judgment of the court, after
pointing out that to permit this would involve an inquiry of a totally
different character from the simple issue involved in the calling of a fresh
witness to speak to some fact connected with the defence put forward at the
trial and in effect engage the court in trying not only the accused but also
the man who wished to confess to committing the crime, said in part (p. 462):

Now the court has in truth no power to try anyone upon any
charge. It is not a tribunal of fact but a court of appeal constituted by
statute to examine into the proceedings of inferior courts in certain cases of
conviction or indictment. We have no power even to direct a new trial by a
jury; much less have we the right to conduct one ourselves.

These general statements of the principles to be followed in
hearing such appeals in England, while indicating generally the reluctance of
the court to hear further evidence except under exceptional circumstances, do
not touch the exact point to be determined here where there was, in my opinion,
no sufficient evidence of a matter essential to the

[Page 368]

validity of the convictions, and counsel for the Crown seeks
to remedy the defect on the prisoners' appeal to the Court of Appeal. If the
application had been to give further evidence on the ground that its existence
had been discovered since the trial and the issue upon which the evidence was
tendered was controversial, the principles stated in the judgment of the
Judicial Committee in Hosking v. Terry 81 and in
the judgment of this Court in Varette v. Sainsbury 82,
would apply. In the view I take of the matter, however, these principles are
inapplicable in the circumstances of the present case.

Section 1021  does not restrict the power of the Court of
Appeal to permit further evidence to be given before it to cases where the
applicant is the appellant, but permits its admission also at the instance of
the respondent if, in the circumstances of the case, it is considered that to
do so is necessary or expedient in the interests of justice. If the evidence
sought to be introduced on the hearing of the appeal touch upon an issue which
is controversial, involving a consideration of the weight to be given to the
evidence, the court of appeal would be involved, as pointed out by Humphreys J.
in Rowland's case, in conducting a trial, and to do this, in my opinion,
is outside of anything contemplated by section 1021 .

The reasons for judgment delivered on the application to
take the further evidence direct attention to the fact that, while all of the
accused were represented by counsel, no objection was made to the admission of
the certificates at the time they were offered in evidence, nor was the
objection raised on the argument of the motion made on behalf of the accused at
the conclusion of the Crown's case for a directed verdict of not guilty, nor
after the judge's charge in which he had instructed the jury that the
certificates were to be accepted as proof of the facts stated in them. From the
fact that the appellants were found guilty on October 25, 1950, and were
sentenced on the following morning, and that the notices of appeal were given on
the same day raising the objection to the admissibility of the certificates, an
inference might be drawn that the failure

[Page 369]

to object at the trial was deliberate. In Rex v. Sanders
83,
where copies of letters were introduced into the evidence by the Crown without
objection and where the prisoners were represented by counsel, Bray J. said
that the objection ought to have been taken at the time and, as it was not then
taken, it could not be entertained by the court. That this statement cannot be
taken without qualification appears from the judgment in Stirland v. Director
of Public Prosecutions 84, where Viscount Simon, L.C. said in
part:

No doubt, as was said in the same case (Rex v. Ellis
(1910) 2 K.B. 746,764), the court must be careful in allowing an appeal on
the ground of reception of inadmissible evidence when no objection has been
made at the trial by the prisoner's counsel. The failure of counsel to object
may have a bearing on the question whether the accused was really prejudiced.
It is not a proper use of counsel's discretion to raise no objection at the
time in order to preserve a ground of objection for a possible appeal, but
where, as here, the reception or rejection of a question involves a principle
of exceptional public importance, it would be unfortunate if the failure of
counsel to object at the trial should lead to a possible miscarriage of justice.

It is not the law, in my opinion, that the failure of
counsel for a prisoner to object to the admission of evidence is in all
circumstances fatal to an appeal taken on the ground that the evidence has been
improperly admitted. If it be assumed that in these circumstances the objection
may still properly be raised, the course adopted by counsel on behalf of the
appellants has made manifest that they did not consider the fact that the drugs
were of the nature referred to in the schedule to the Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act was open to dispute and did not intend to tender evidence to
dispute it. The accuracy of the evidence given in the Court of Appeal was not
open to question and where it is clear that there had been no intention on the
part of the accused persons to dispute the facts shown, I am unable to perceive
any principle of law governing the exercise of the discretion vested in the
court which has been infringed by receiving it. In my opinion, the answer to
the first question should be in the affirmative.

Section 1021  permits the taking of further evidence
""for the purposes of an appeal under this part."" I see no ambiguity
in this language nor anything in the section or elsewhere in the sections
relating to criminal appeals restricting, or indicating any intention of
restricting the

[Page 370]

effect to be given by the court to the further evidence in
exercising its powers under section 1014 . I respectfully agree with Mr. Justice
Dysart that the evidence given before the Court of Appeal in this matter is as
nearly conclusive as oral testimony can be and that it was within the powers of
the Court to affirm the conviction and dismiss the appeals.

I would dismiss these appeals.

Fauteux J.:—At
the Summer Assizes of the Court of King's Bench, held in the Eastern Judicial
District, Province of Manitoba, the appellants were jointly tried, and on the
25th of October 1950, found guilty on three counts of conspiracy, i.e.,
conspiracy (a) to possess, (b) to sell, and (c) to
cause to be carried in Canada, without first having obtained a licence from the
Minister of National Health and Welfare, or other lawful authority, drugs
within the meaning of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act.

Each of the appellants entered an appeal 85
against these convictions, raising inter alia, the following points:
beyond the prima facie proof, resulting from the production of several
certificates of analysis, it was argued that there was no evidence establishing
that the drugs referred to therein were drugs within the meaning of the Act,
and that such certificates, admissible as such proof on a charge of actual
possession, sale or transport, were inadmissible on a charge of conspiracy to
possess, sell or transport. These contentions eventually turned out to be those
on which the appeal fell to be determined. During the hearing, without acceding
to the appellants' views, the respondent, nonetheless, applied for and obtained
permission of the Court of Appeal—under section 1021  of the Criminal Code —to
take and introduce in the record, the oral evidence of the two Dominion
analysts who had issued these certificates filed at trial. The new evidence
having been taken and considered, the appeals were dismissed.

Thereupon and pursuant to an application made under section
1025 (1) of the Code, the appellants applied for and

[Page 371]

obtained leave to appeal to this Court on the following
questions of law:

(1) Was the Court of Appeal empowered under section
1014 and 1021 (1) and (b) of the Code or otherwise, to
allow the respondent to produce before that Court the oral evidence actually
given?

(2) If so, was the Court empowered on such evidence
taken in conjunction with that given at the trial, to affirm the conviction or
was it authorized merely to order a new trial?

In my view, it does not appear necessary, for the proper
determination of this appeal, to deal with these two questions. For, while the
additional evidence, introduced in appeal, might serve to confirm the
conviction that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the
premises, I have reached the conclusion that such evidence was not essential to
legally support the verdict rendered. In my view, as I propose to show, the
certificates of analysis were, in this prosecution, admissible evidence of the
facts therein stated and, in any event, the record discloses that the defence,
at trial, either chose—as it was, by law, entitled—not to hold the Crown to
strict proof with respect to this particular issue, or else, opted to attempt
to preserve a ground of objection for a possible appeal.

As to the admissibility of the certificates of analysis,
Section 18 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act—hereinafter referred to as
the Act—is the relevant section. The opening words of the English and French
versions governing its operation must be quoted:

In any prosecution under this Act … Dans toute
poursuite sous le régime de la présente loi …

The adequate interpretation of these opening words cannot
legally be gained by merely considering them only within the narrow compass of
the section, or even of the Act in which they are found. It must rather
be gathered in the full light of the relevant provisions of the Interpretation
Act, particularly sections 15 and 28. The true import of section 15 was
recently considered in Robinson or Robertson v. The King 86,
particularly at pages 529, 530. Section 28 was equally considered by this Court
in Simcovitch v. The King 87. In that case, Sir
Lyman Duff, applying

[Page 372]

the provisions of the latter section to section 191 of the Bankruptcy
Act, under which the appellants were prosecuted, said that section 191 must
be read and construed on the footing that the provisions of the Criminal
Code  apply-to the offences created by it. The same principle must prevail
as to the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act and so must its provisions,
creating offences, be read and construed.

In this broader view, the following may be said. The opening
words of section 18 are, on one hand, quite adequate to prevent the application
of the section in the case of a prosecution entirely foreign to the Act, e.g.
one exclusively under the Code. Thus, if a person sells a quantity of
drugs, falsely representing them to be heroin, and obtains thereby a sum of
money, the Crown could not, on a prosecution under section 405  of the Criminal
Code , prove by means of a certificate of a Dominion analyst, the nature of
the drugs sold, for this would not be a prosecution authorized under the Act.
I cannot, however, convince myself that the all-embracing meaning of the
language ""In any prosecution under this Act"", would be apt to include
within the operation of section 18 , prosecutions of offences nominally
mentioned in the Act—such as the sale of drugs—and at the same time, be apt to
exclude from its operation prosecutions of the other offences—such as counselling
or conspiring to sell drugs—which Parliament by, and only by, the very same
provision in the Act, virtually created and, therefore, rendered subject
to prosecution. By force of section 28, in making the sale of drugs an offence,
Parliament effectively thereby made the counselling of a sale, or the
conspiracy to sell drugs, offences, and authorized by the Act itself, in
each case, a prosecution. The prosecution of any of these offences is, in my
view, a prosecution under the Act. The opening words of section 18  are
not ""In any prosecution for an offence under the Act"", but ""In
any prosecution under the Act"".

In Desrochers v. The King 88, a
case which was not quoted before the Manitoba Court of Appeal nor on the
application for leave to appeal to this Court, the Court of Appeal of the
Province of Quebec has, on a charge of conspiracy to commit an offence under
the Excise Act , admitted as evidence the certificate of analysis
authorized under the

[Page 373]

latter Act in terms similar to those of section 18.
This decision, rendered in 1937, was always followed in the Province of Quebec.

I do not find it necessary, however, to discuss this point
any further, for the following reason, which led me to the conclusion that the
additional evidence, introduced in appeal, was unessential to legally support
the verdict rendered by the jury, is by itself sufficient.

As indicated above, the record in this case discloses the
following facts: Defence counsel at trial entirely and consistently refrained
from making any objection when these certificates—twelve in number—were filed
by the Crown; properly notified, pursuant to a local practice, of the actual
presence in Court of one of the Dominion analysts, who had issued some of them,
and that, if heard, his testimony would bear on the facts therein appearing,
counsel for the defence not only refrained from taking advantage of the
opportunity to cross-examine him but positively indicated the intention not to
do so; at the close of the evidence for the prosecution, a motion for non suit
was made on behalf of the appellants, but the point as to the admissibility of
the certificates was not even mentioned; the appellants were not heard at
trial, nor was there any evidence adduced by the defence, nor was there any
attempt to assail the facts mentioned in the certificates.

At the close of the judge's address, several objections were
made by counsel for the defence; but, again, and though the judge had, in plain
terms, instructed the jury that the certificates were positive evidence of the
facts they mentioned, nothing was said, in this respect, by the defence. The
verdict was rendered late on the afternoon of the 25th and the sentence imposed
in the forenoon of the 26th and, on the same day, the notice of appeal which
was served revealed, for the first time, this ground for complaint.

A large discretion is given to counsel in the conduct of the
defence. Particularly, and under section 978  of the Criminal Code , it
was open to counsel to make any admission as to any of the issues which the
Crown had to prove as part of its case. Likewise, and in respect to the
relevant issue, the defence had the discretion not to hold the Crown to strict
legal proof. In my view, the whole conduct of

[Page 374]

the defence, in this case, manifested at trial a positive
intention to accept the certificates as sufficient evidence of the facts
therein stated, and to disregard them as one of the issues on which the case
was fought, by the accused, represented by counsel.

In Davis and Ridley 89, Darling J., as he then
was, said at page 139:

It is stated that in opening the case, counsel for the
prosecution stated matters which were not evidence against the appellant Davis
on his trial, but we have been unable to find the admission of any evidence
that could be objected to; but if it were so, if counsel on the other side do
not object, it is not obligatory on the judge to do so. When a prisoner is
defended by counsel and he chooses, for reasons of his own, to allow
such evidence to be let in without objection, he cannot come here and ask to
have the verdict revised on that ground.

In The King v. Sanders 90, the
accused was charged with obtaining money by false pretences. During his opening
speech, counsel for the prosecution proposed to read copies of letters alleged
to have been written to the appellant by the prosecutor's wife and solicitor.
As no notice to produce the original letters had been given to the defence,
objection was taken and maintained äs to the reading of
such copies. However and in the course of the examination of the complainant by
the Crown, these copies were admitted in evidence without any objection from
counsel for the defence. The accused having been convicted, appealed on the
ground that the copies of the letters were wrongly admitted. The judgment of
the Court (Bray, Avory and Sankey, JJ.) was delivered by Bray J. At page 553,
Bray J. said:

In our opinion, if it was intended to rely on this point,
the objection should have been repeated at the time the evidence was tendered,
and not having been taken then, it cannot now be taken in this Court, at all
events, when the prisoner was represented by counsel.

Said Viscount Simon in Stirland v. The Director of
Public Prosecutions 91.

There is no universal rule that a conviction cannot be
quashed on the ground of the improper admission of evidence prejudicial to the
prisoner unless an application is made at the time by counsel for the prisoner
for the trial to begin again before another jury. It has been said more than
once that a judge when trying a case should not wait for objection to be taken
to the admissibility of the evidence but should stop such questions himself. If
that be the judge's duty it can hardly be fatal

[Page 375]

to an appeal founded on the admission of an improper
question that counsel failed at the time to raise the matter. No doubt the
Court must be careful in allowing an appeal on the ground of reception of
inadmissible evidence when no objection has been made at the trial by the
prisoner's counsel. The failure of counsel to object may have a bearing on the
question whether the accused was really ""prejudiced."" It is not a
proper use of counsel's discretion to raise no objection at the time in order
to preserve a ground of objection for a possible appeal.

These authorities are sufficient to support the proposition
that, as to the consequences of the failure to object, there is no steadfast
rule, and that, while the failure to object to inadmissible evidence is not
always fatal, it cannot be said that it is never so.

Indeed, as stated by Lord Sankey in Maxwell v. Director
of Public Prosecutions 92:

… the whole policy of English criminal law has been to see
that as against the prisoner every rule in his favour is observed and that no
rule is broken so as to prejudice the chance of the jury fairly trying the true
issues. The sanction for the observance of the rules of evidence in criminal
cases is that, if they are broken in any case, the conviction may be
quashed.

In the present case, however, the record, as indicated
above, discloses more than a mere omission to object, as it shows a consistent
conduct in this respect and a clear and positive intention not to deal with
this particular point as being one in controversy in the case.

It might be, as it was intimated, that the defence acted in
this way to preserve a possible ground of appeal; if so, the open conduct of
the defence sufficiently defeats such a purpose, to which I would not find it
consonant with the due administration of justice, to give effect.

With all these circumstances, there was, in the premises, no
principle involved, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

The appeal, in each case, should be dismissed.

Appeals dismissed.

LEON AZOULAY APPELLANT

AND

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN RESPONDENT.

PRESENT: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Estey
and Fauteux JJ. 

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL
SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law-Abortion-Jury trial-No review
of evidence by trial judge.

The appellant, charged with having
unlawfully used instruments or other means on the deceased woman with intent to
procure her miscarriage, was found guilty of manslaughter. His conviction was
affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal for Quebec, the dissenting
judgment holding that the evidence did not warrant a conviction and that the
trial judge failed to instruct properly the jury, by omitting to review the
evidence.

Held (Rand and Fauteux JJ. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed
and a new trial directed.

Per Rinfret
C.J., Taschereau and Estey JJ.: As a general rule, in the course of his charge
a trial judge should review the substantial parts of the evidence and give the
jury the theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and
effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they
find them. Where, as here, the evidence was technical and somewhat involved, it
was particularly important to strip it of the non-essentials, and to present to
the jury the evidence in its proper relation to the matters requiring factual
decision, and direct it also to the case put forward by the prosecution and by
the defence. Unfortunately, this was not done here, and the explanations and
grounds of defence were not adequately put before the jury. There was evidence
upon which a jury, properly instructed, could have found the accused guilty,
but since it cannot be said that the verdict would necessarily have been the
said if the proper instructions had been given, this was, therefore, not a case
for the application of s. 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code .

Per Rand
J. (dissenting) : In a case such as here, where the defence was plain and
uncomplicated, the absence of a repetition of the few salient facts had not and
could not have had the slightest influence on the minds of the jury in reaching
their verdict; there was, therefore, no ground for appeal and a fortiori no
substantial wrong had been done.

Per Fauteux
J. (dissenting) : The practical significance which could be attached to the
opinions of the experts called for the defence was more dependent upon than
promoting the credibility of the appellant's testimony. The jury disbelieved
him. The case for the appellant would have been weakened rather than
strengthened if the trial judge had dealt exhaustively with the expert
opinions.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1],
affirming, Galipeault C.J.A. dissenting, the jury's verdict of man-slaughter.

[Page 496]

J. J. Robinette Q.C. and P. B. C.
Pepper for the appellant. The issue narrowed down
to the proper inference to be drawn from the medical testimony. There is no
doubt that the dissent was on a question of law, but should there be, it should
be resolved in favour of the accused.

The trial judge having failed to
review the evidence for the jury in such a way that they could clearly
appreciate the issues involved and the evidence bearing upon each issue, this
was a serious non direction amounting to misdirection. Rex v. Boak [2], Rex v. Hughes [3], Rex v. Hill [4]), Rex v. Stephen[5]) and Rex v. Arnold[6].

The trial judge's charge did not,
as it should have, adequately put before the jury the accused's explanations
and grounds of defence and the evidence in support there-of. Moreover, he
should also show the weakness in the Crown's case. Rex v. Kirk [7], Brooks v. Rex[8], Rex v. Scott[9], Markadonis v. Rex[10], Wu v. Rex[11], Rex v. West[12], Rex v. Harms[13] and Rex v. Gouin [14]

The circumstantial evidence was far
from being incon­sistent with any other rational conclusion than that the
accused was the guilty person within the rule in Odge's case. Lizotte
v. The King[15],
Rienblatt v. The King [16]and
Fraser v. The King[17].

The trial judge erred in admitting gynecological
instru­ments not pertaining to the issues in the case, to the preju­dice of the
accused. Rex v. Picken[18].

Henri Masson-Loranger Q.C. for the respondent. In view of the very simple issue involved in
this case, namely, was the haemorrhage spontaneous or caused by the appel­lant,
there was no need for the trial judge to review the evidence. The doctors on
both sides were' in accord. No objection to the charge was made. It would have
weakened the appellant's case rather than strengthened it had he

[Page 497]

done so. There was therefore no
prejudice. The jurisprudence cited by the appellant must be distinguished as
those were all cases where it was essential to relate the facts to a principle
of law i.e., conspiracy. But the review is not necessary in a case of simple
denial.

There is here no analogy with the
case of Picken, since here we have a doctor's office regularly
organized.

The circumstantial evidence leads
indubitably to the guilt of the accused and to no other conclusion, and this
beyond any reasonable doubt.

There was ample evidence to support
the verdict and the medical evidence was not contradictory. At the very least,
this is a case for the application of s. 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code .

The judgment of the
Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by

TASCHEREAU J.-The accused was charged with the murder
of Blanche Lepire, and was found guilty of man-slaughter. It is the contention
of the Crown that the appellant, for the unlawful purpose of procuring the mis-carriage
of the deceased woman, used on her instruments, which eventually caused her
death. The Court of Appeal[19]
confirmed the verdict, Chief Justice Galipeault dissenting. He reached the
conclusion that the evidence did not warrant a conviction, and that the trial
judge failed to instruct properly the jury, in omitting to review the evidence,
so that they could clearly appreciate the issues involved.

As I have come to the
conclusion that there should be a new trial, I do not intend to deal with all
the details of the evidence. It will be sufficient to say that I do not agree
with the learned dissenting judge, that the verdict was unreasonable and
unjustified. There was, I think, evidence upon which a jury could convict or
acquit, whether they accepted the theory of the Crown, or were left in doubt
when the defence rested its case.

On the second point, I
agree with the Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench. The rule which has
been laid down, and consistently followed is that in a jury trial the presiding
judge must, except in rare cases where it

[Page 498]

would be needless to do so, review the
substantial parts of the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence,
so that they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the
law is to be applied to the facts as they find them. (Spencer
v. Alaska Parkers[20].
As Kellock J.A. (as he then was) said in Rex v. Stephen et al.[21] : ""It is not
sufficient that the whole evidence be left to the jury in bulk for
valuation."" The pivotal questions upon which the defence stands must
be clearly presented to the jury's mind. Of course, it is not necessary that
the trial judge should review all the facts, and that his charge be a minute
record of the evidence adduced, but as Rivard, J.A. said in Vincent v. Regem[22] :

Il faut admettre que l'adresse du juge est
plutôt brève et que, tant sur les faits que sur les questions de droit, il n'a
dit que l'essentiel, sans développement. Mais la question n'est pas de savoir
si le juge a été court; il faut rechercher plutôt s'il
a omis le nécessaire.

In Wu v. The King[23], Mr. Justice Lamont speaking for this Court expressed his views as
follows:‑

There is no doubt that in the trial court an
accused person is ordinarily entitled to rely upon all alternative defences for
which a foundation of fact appears in the record, and, in my opinion, it makes
no difference whether the evidence which forms that foundation has been given
by the witnesses for the Crown or for the accused, or otherwise. What is
essential is that the record contains evidence which, if accepted by the jury,
would constitute a valid defence to the charge laid. Where such evidence
appears it is the duty of the trial judge to call the attention of the jury to
that evidence and instruct them in reference thereto.

More recently, Mr. Justice Kerwin in Forsythe
v. The King[24],
also said:‑

However, while the general statement of the
law of conspiracy made by the trial judge may be unimpeachable, it was of the
utmost importance in this case that the application of the law to the facts
should be explained fully to the jury, particularly so far as the evidence
relating to Carson's activities was concerned.

In Rex v. Arnold[25], the Court of Appeal
,of Ontario ordered a new trial, and Mr. Justice Laidlaw, giving the unanimous
judgment of the Court restated the law as follows:‑

An accused is entitled to have a trial
judge give the theory of the defence to the jury, and it is difficult to
conceive of a case where, in doing so, he can refrain from making at least some
reference to the

[Page 499]

evidence. Here, I am thoroughly satisfied
that there was misdirection to the jury on the subject of consent, and apart
from that misdirection I think it was incumbent upon the learned trial judge to
do more than simply say to the jury that it was for them to decide whom they
believed, without making any reference to the evidence at all.

If any other authority
is needed, see Brooks v. The King[26],
Markadonis v. The King[27]
, Rex v. Hill et al[28].

In the present case,
the trial judge, after having ex­plained the law to the jury, said:‑

Now, as to facts. I will not comment on
them. Both parties have elaborated before you all the arguments for and against
the guilt or the innocence of the accused, and of course it is up to you to
say, not for me.

He then recapitulated
in a few words what the Crown Attorney and Counsel for the defence had said in
their addresses, and concluded by saying:‑

Both points of view have been well
elaborated by the Defence and the Crown and I shall say no more on facts.

I do not think that
this is sufficient. This trial lasted one week, twenty-four witnesses were
heard of which twelve for the defence. Three experts, two of which were called
by the appellant, gave very elaborate explanations on medical matters, and
their respective opinions on the result of the autopsy that was performed on
the body of the deceased woman. It was, I think, the duty of the trial judge,
in summing up this highly technical and con­flicting evidence, to strip it of
the non-essentials, and as O'Halloran, J.A. said in Rex v. Hughes[29] to present to the jury
the evidence in its proper relation to the matters requiring factual decision,
and direct it also to the case put forward by the prosecution and the answer of
the defence, or such answer as the evidence permitted. Unfortunately, this has
not been done, and the explanations and grounds of defence have not adequately
been put before the jury.

I am of opinion that
the jury was left in a state of confusion, and I cannot say that after the judge's
address, they were in a position to fully appreciate the value and effect of
the evidence. As I do not think that the verdict would have necessarily been
the same if the proper instruc­tions had been given, I believe that 1014 (2)
has no application.

I would direct a new
trial.

[Page 500]

RAND J. (dissenting)
:-The defence here was plain and uncomplicated: it was that at the moment the
accused was about to examine the woman internally for fibromas, a spontaneous
process of miscarriage started causing a severance of the placenta from the
wall of the uterus and leading to a fatal hemorrhage. The issue was simply
whether the rupture was natural or had been provoked artificially by the
accused with the intent of bringing about an abortion.

The facts were largely undisputed: only those at
the critical moments leading to the severance were in contro­versy. Four items
of internal evidence were considered by the Crown to point to an artificially
induced dilatation of the cervix: an abrasion of the cervix; dilation of the
cervical canal; the presence of muscular fibre on the detached placenta; and
the existence of a burrow along the canal. What was said against this was that,
in the presence of fibromas, these conditions could possibly arise in the
natural course of dilatation. There were, in addition, surrounding
circumstances, presented in large part by the accused, on which little doubt or
question could arise.

Behind that facade of conditions and actions was
con­cealed the intent or purpose: was it legitimate or criminal? With what
""theory"" can we dignify such a simple situation? The trial took a
full week and there was much examination of the medical testimony: but in the
end, that of the defence reduced itself to what I have mentioned. What could the
repetition of the four items have added to the knowledge or appreciation of
that issue by the jury? They had listened to a proliferation of questions about
them almost at nauseam. They would, most probably, have received a further
reference to them from the court with secret impatience; and I have no doubt
that the absence of such a repetition had not and could not have had the
slightest influence on their minds in reaching their verdict. In such an
uncomplicated question, to speak of a ""theory"" or to require as,
virtually, an absolute rule, the recounting of the few salient facts would be
to add an artificiality of no value to the machinery of trial. The rule cannot
be taken to be absolute in requiring such an exposition; it depends upon the
circumstances of each case.

[Page 501]

Lazure J., who presided, has had a long and
distinguished experience in criminal trials, and in the situation as I con­ceive
it, I must decline to disregard his judgment that the narrow issues and
significant facts, with all their implica­tions, were fully and intelligently
appreciated by the jury. No objection to the charge was made by the able
counsel representing the accused nor was the ground urged here taken in the
notice of appeal to the King's Bench.

The rule arises from the necessity that the jury
be fully apprised of every aspect of the case; their judgment other-wise would
be vitiated. But once that essential condition is satisfied, anything further
of the nature suggested here would be a useless impediment. Its value is as a
safeguard against misjudging the jury's grasp of the issues and in the
impartial examination of controverted, involved or complex matters and their
significance. But there are situations in which it can be said with judicial
certainty that reiteration is unnecessary; in such cases the verdict is given
in disregard of its presence or absence. I take the condition of the rule to be
that the statement required must be such that its omission might have affected
the verdict: if, as here, it could not have done so, there is no ground for
appeal and a fortiori no substantial wrong has been done.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Mrs. P., on August 20, 1947, went to the office
of the appellant, a medical practitioner in Montreal, where, be-cause of a
haemorrhage caused by the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall, she
died.

The Crown contends that the haemorrhage resulted
from an attempt on the appellant's part to effect an abortion. The appellant
contends that the separation and consequent haemorrhage were due to natural
causes.

[Page 502]

The Crown called
evidence as to events and conversa­tions leading to the examination, the manner
in which Mrs. P. was prepared therefore and the circumstances at the office. A
pathologist was also called who made a post mortem on the afternoon of the
death. He found the cervical canal abnormally dilated in relation to the length
of the cervix, abrasions on the cervix, a burrow or groove on the cervical
canal and fibres on the placenta, which came from the uterine wall. These
factors, viewed as a whole, together with his negative observations in his
opinion justified the conclusion that there had been an attempted abortion.

The appellant admitted
making an examination of the lungs, heart and abdomen and the taking of a
haemoglobin test; that before he had made any internal examination she had
commenced to haemorrhage; that in the course of his efforts to stop the
haemorrhage he used a speculum, a tenaculum and did some packing. He also gave
her Pituitrin and Vitamin K.

The medical evidence is
all to the effect that Mrs. P. had been pregnant between five and six months.
It is also clear that she had several fibroids upon the wall of her uterus
which, because of their size and condition, had been there some time. The
appellant was of the opinion that Mrs. P. was in labour when she consulted him
on the 20th and that because of the fibroids and consequently diseased and
weakened condition of the tissues this separation of the placenta occurred in
the course of labour. Moreover, he stated that the fact that she was in labour
explained the dilatation of the cervical canal.

Two pathologists were
called on behalf of the appellant whose evidence lent support to the view that
the dilatation of the cervical canal might have happened normally, par­ticularly
if she was in labour. They also expressed the view that in the same
circumstances, because of the diseased and weakened condition of the tissues of
the uterine wall, the fibres might have separated therefrom with, and remained
upon the placenta. As to the abrasions on the cervix and the groove on the
cervical canal, these did pro-vide evidence of trauma or injury which might
have been caused in the course of the packing.

[Page 503]

The learned trial judge clearly and
appropriately discussed the relevant law, the certainty that must be estab­lished
where the evidence is circumstantial and that the jury must be satisfied that
the evidence establishes the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt
before finding him guilty. In the course of his charge the learned judge stated,
in part, as follows:

Now, as to facts. I will not comment on
them. Both parties have elaborated before you all the arguments for and against
the guilt or the innocence of the accused, and of course it is up to you to
say, not for me.

Again he stated:

Both points of view have been well
elaborated by the Defence and the Crown and I shall say no more on facts.

The authorities contemplate that in the course
of his charge a trial judge should, as a general rule, explain the relevant law
and so relate it to the evidence that the jury may appreciate the issues or
questions they must pass upon in order to render a verdict of guilty or not
guilty. Where, as here, the evidence is technical and somewhat involved, it is
particularly important that he should do so in a manner that will assist the
jury in determining its relevancy and what weight or value they will attribute
to the respective portions. It is, of course, unnecessary that the jury's
attention be directed to all of the evidence, and how far a trial judge should
go in discussing it must depend in each case upon the nature and character of
the evidence in relation to the charge, the issues raised and the conduct of
the trial. Wu v. The King[31]
; Brooks v. The King [32]
; Picken v. The King [33]
; Preston v. The King [34];
Black-stone, Vol. 3, ch. 23, p. 375; The Queen
v. Coney [35];
Rex. v. Bateman[36].

Moreover, the defence throughout was that the
accused had treated Mrs. P. in a professional and legal manner. This was
supported by evidence of the accused as to his own conduct, his professional
opinion as to the nature and character of the natural cause of the separation
of the placenta and of his efforts to save her life. The evidence of the
pathologists, called on his own behalf, somewhat supported his opinion as to
the natural cause of the separation

[Page 504]

of the placenta and the
dilatation of the cervical canal. They also expressed their opinions that the
abrasions and groove might have been caused by instruments used in the course
of packing.

This theory of the
defence and the evidence in relation thereto were not placed before the jury in
a manner that would assist the jurymen in appreciating the particular facts and
circumstances they should consider in determin­ing whether the accused be
guilty or not guilty. Brooks v. The King, supra; Rex v. Henderson [37]; Rex v. Kirk[38]); Rex v. Arnold[39].

There was ample
evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed, might have found the accused
guilty, but it cannot be said that a jury, acting judicially, would neces­sarily
have arrived at that conclusion and, therefore, it is

not a case for the
application of the provisions of s. 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code .

The appeal should be
allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting) :-A
careful consideration of the record convinced me that the practical
significance which the defence expert opinions could have at the end of the
case was more dependent upon than promoting the measure of credit the jury
would then be ready to attach to the very testimony of the appellant himself.
Exonerating possibilities indicated by them could only be of trivial or no
value if his relation .of the occurrence, considered in the light of the rest
of the evidence, was not accepted as truthful. That the jury did disbelieve what
he said as to the nature of his intervention is clearly manifested by their
verdict. I have reached the conclusion that had the trial Judge dealt with the
expert opinions exhaustively, the case for the appellant would have been
weakened rather than strengthened. As there will be a new trial, it is not
convenient to review the evidence in order to demonstrate the factual premises
upon which the above findings are made. One may point out, however, that these
conclusions are not inconsistent with but, in some degree, supported by the
fact that in the course of his

[Page 505]

address, the then counsel of the appellant-an
able one, as the record shows-rather invited the jury to minimize the value to
be attached to expert opinions, the fact that he did not, at the end of the
address of the trial Judge, raise any objections as to the omission of the
latter to review this or other evidence, the fact that, in the notice of
appeal, counsel did not even mention this ground on which the argument before
us was centered and which, moreover, is not the one upon which the appeal in
the Court below fell virtually to be determined.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal allowed; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE
 OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—S. 461—Jury trial—Refusal of trial judge to
have charge taken in shorthand—No report made under s. 1020  of the Criminal
Code .

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec1, affirming, Casey and McDougall JJ.A.
dissenting, the appellant's conviction following his trial before a judge and
jury on a charge of breaking and entering with intent to commit a theft. The
evidence was circumstantial and the defence was an alibi.

After the address of the trial judge to the jury,
counsel for the defence moved that the trial judge should direct the jury to
the effect that they should acquit the accused if they entertained a reasonable
doubt concerning the question of alibi, to which motion the trial judge
answered that that had been sufficiently explained. The address of the trial
judge was not taken by a stenographer, a defence motion to have it done having
been refused.

The trial judge did not furnish to the Court of
Appeal a report as provided for under s. 1020  of the Criminal Code  nor
was there any application made on behalf of the appellant in the Court of
Appeal for an order requiring the trial judge to comply with the section and
furnish a report. (Baron v. The King [1930] S.C.R. 194 and Northey
v. The King [1948] S.C.R. 135 were referred to during the argument
before this Court).

The offence was committed in December 1949, the
verdict was given in October 1950 and the judgment of the Court of Appeal was
rendered in June 1951. In view of the fact

[Page 480]

that the notice of appeal to this Court was served in
July 1951 and the case filed in September 1951, counsel for the appellant was
asked for, but gave no explanation as to, the cause of the delay in the setting
down of the case for hearing in this Court.

Alexandre Chevalier Q.C. for the appellant.

René T. Hébert Q.C. for
the respondent.

At the close of the argument on behalf of the appellant, the
following oral judgment was delivered by the Chief Justice :

The Court is unanimously of opinion that it was open to the
appellant to obtain before the Court of Appeal an order requesting the trial
judge to file the report under s.,1020; in which case, the Court of Appeal and
this Court as well would have had the proper material necessary for the
consideration of the appeal. In the absence of such material, we have to
dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Common betting-house—Summary
trial under Part XVI—Motion for non-suit—Criminal Code , ss. 229 , 773 (f),
777 (a), 1013(4)  1023(2).

The appellants were jointly charged with
having kept a common betting-house and were tried summarily before a magistrate
pursuant to ss. 773 (f) and 777 (a) of the Criminal Code . On
a motion for nonsuit, made at the close of the case for the Crown, the charge was
dismissed as against all four accused. Pursuant to s. 1013(4) of the Code, the
Crown appealed the acquittal on the ground that there was evidence to support
the case against the accused and the Court of Appeal for Ontario ordered a new
trial.

Held: (1): The
appeal of the appellant Feeley should be dismissed; there was evidence which,
if accepted, showed circumstances from which the inference might fairly be
drawn that the building in question was being used as a common betting-house;
and the evidence as to the statements made by this appellant and as to his
actions was such that, in the absence of explanation or denial, the tribunal of
fact might properly have decided that he was guilty of being the keeper of such
betting-house.

(2): The appeals of the appellants Reid,
Hergel and Meechan should be allowed and a judgment of acquittal entered, there
being no evidence on which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could
have found a verdict of guilty.

Held also,
that the rules laid down in The King v. Morabito [1949] S.C.R. 172. (i)
that the judicial officer presiding at the trial of a criminal charge can not
dismiss the charge at the close of the case for the Crown and before the
defence has elected whether or not to give evidence unless at that stage there
is no evidence upon which a jury might convict, and (ii) that whether or not
there is such evidence is a question of law alone, are applicable to the
conduct of a trial under Part XVI of the Criminal Code .

APPEALS from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, allowing the Crown’s appeal from the acquittal of the
accused and ordering a new trial.

W.E. MacDonald for the appellants.

C.P. Hope Q.C. for the respondent.

[Page 60]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:—

CARTWRIGHT J.—The appellants were jointly
charged that they,

within six months ending on the 4th day of
November A.D. 1950 at the Town of New Toronto in the County of York unlawfully
did keep a common betting house at the premises situate and known as Lakeside
Cigar Store, 132 Sixth Street in the said Town of New Toronto, contrary to
Section 229  of the Criminal Code .

They were tried summarily before His Worship
Magistrate Hand pursuant to sections 773  (f) and 777 (a) of
the Criminal Code . Each of the appellants was separately represented.
Upon the close of the case for the Crown on January 26, 1951, the counsel for
each defendant moved “for non-suit and dismissal in respect of” his client. The
learned Magistrate granted this motion as to the appellants Hergel and Meechan,
reserved his judgment as to the appellants Feeley and Reid and adjourned the
hearing to January 29, 1951, on which date he gave judgment dismissing the
charge against them also.

The learned Magistrate did not give extended
reasons for judgment. In dealing with the motion so far as Hergel and Meechan
were concerned he said “I find no evidence for a conviction against Andrew
Hergel and Edward Meechan and the charge against them will be dismissed.” In
dealing with the motion as to Feeley and Reid he simply stated that the motion
would be granted and the charge dismissed.

From this judgment of acquittal the
Attorney-General appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario pursuant to
section 1013 (4)  of the Criminal Code  on the following ground:—

That the learned Magistrate erred in
holding that there was no evidence to support the Crown’s case against the
accused.

The appeal was allowed and a new trial directed
as to all four of the appellants, who now appeal to this Court pursuant to
section 1023 (2) of the Code. We have not the benefit of any
written reasons for the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

It is common ground that had the learned
Magistrate refused the motion the appellants would have had the right to call
evidence for the defence if so advised and

[Page 61]

counsel for the respondent submits that the
decision of this Court in The King v. Morabito[1] establishes (i) that at that stage it was
not open to the learned Magistrate to dismiss the charge unless there was no
evidence on which, had the trial been before a jury, a properly instructed
jury, acting reasonably, might have convicted the accused, and (ii) that
whether or not there was such evidence is “a question of law alone” within the
meaning of section 1013 (4) of the Code. I agree with this
submission.

Counsel for the appellant sought to distinguish
the Morabito case from the case at bar. It is true that in the former
case the trial was held under the provisions of Part XVIII of the Code and
in the latter under Part XVI; and that Perry v. The King[2], approved in the judgment of Kellock J.,
concurred in by Rand and Locke, JJ., in the Morabito case, dealt with a
charge disposed of under Part XV of the Code. It would seem, however,
that Rex v. Olsen[3] also,
approved in the judgment of Kellock J., dealt with a charge tried under Part
XVI. The offence there charged was one on which the Crown might have proceeded
either summarily or upon indictment and the fact that there was an appeal to
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia indicates that the latter course had
been followed. It is true that the corresponding sections in Parts XV, XVI
and XVIII of the Code are not identically worded but in proceedings
under each of such parts the judicial officer before whom the trial is held
acts as judge both of the law and of the facts and it appears to me that the
rules laid down in the Morabito case are applicable to the conduct of a
trial under Part XVI of the Code. It is therefore necessary to consider
as to each appellant whether at the close of the Crown’s case there was evidence
upon which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, might have convicted
him.

The charge being that of keeping a common
betting-house it was essential for the Crown to prove (i) that the building
known as 132 Sixth Street, New Toronto, was at the relevant time a common
betting-house, and (ii) that each appellant was a keeper thereof.

[Page 62]

The burden resting upon the prosecution as to
(ii) above is somewhat lightened by the terms of section 229 (3)  of the Criminal
Code  reading as follows:—

(3) Every one who appears, acts or behaves
as master or mistress, or as the person having the care, government or
management of any disorderly house, or as assisting in such care, government or
management, shall be deemed to be the keeper thereof and is liable to be
prosecuted and punished as such although in fact he or she is not the real
owner or keeper thereof.

As in my view the order for a new trial should
be upheld as to the appellant Feeley, I do not propose to discuss the evidence
in detail. During the argument counsel for the Crown made it clear that he did
not rely upon the presumptions created in certain circumstances by
sections 985  and 986 (2)  of the Criminal Code . He submitted that a prima
facie case was made out against all of the appellants without the aid of
these statutory presumptions.

In my view there was evidence which, if
accepted, showed circumstances from which the inference might fairly be drawn
that on the 3rd of November, 1950 the building in question was being used as a
common betting-house. The more difficult question is whether there was evidence
that the appellants were the keepers of such betting-house.

I have reached the conclusion that the evidence
as to the statements made by the appellant Feeley, and as to his actions was
such that, in the absence of explanation or denial, the tribunal of fact might
properly have decided that he was guilty.

As to the appellants Reid, Hergel and Meechan
respectively counsel for the respondent relies on the following items of
evidence: As to Reid: (i) the license, Exhibit 30 (ii) the fact that in the
pocket of a coat hanging in a closet on the premises was “a liquor permit in
the name of George Reid” (iii) that he was found by the police in the cellar of
the store in the circumstances to be mentioned hereafter.

As to Hergel: (i) that on November 3,1950, he
was twice seen to leave the premises in question and return (ii) the same as
item (iii) in the case of Reid.

As to Meechan: (i) he had in his possession a
key which would open the back door of the building in question and a key which
would open the door of a small room in the building (ii) the same as item (iii)
in the case of Reid.

[Page 63]

It will be convenient to deal first with the
third item mentioned in the case of Reid as it is common to these three
appellants. There was evidence that Reid, Hergel and Meechan were all found by
the police in the cellar room, under the building in question, containing the
oil furnace. There was evidence from which it would have been open to a jury to
draw the inference that one or more of them had been burning in the furnace
pieces of paper which it was open to the jury to infer were betting slips but
there was no evidence from which the jury could infer that all three of them
had taken part in this or from which it could be determined which one had been
doing it. This being so the effect of this item is only to warrant the drawing
of an inference that each of the three was present while betting slips were
being destroyed. It does not warrant the drawing of the inference as to any one
of them that he destroyed betting slips.

Dealing next with item (i) as to Reid, there was
evidence that a document, Exhibit 30, was on the wall in the building in
question. It reads as follows:

                                                         TOWN
OF NEW TORONTO                                  No. 1 672

Tobacco

LICENSE

This License is granted to Lakeside Cigar
Store of 132 6th St. to carry on Business or Businesses as above mentioned
in the Town of New Toronto.

PROVIDED that the said Geo. Reid (L.C. St.)
shall duly observe all By-laws made and provided by the Municipal Council of
the Town of New Toronto, under which this License is Issued.

This License to continue in force until the
31st day of Dec. 1950 and no longer. This License may be Cancelled if the
provisions of any By-law regarding the same are not fully observed.

ISSUED at the Town of New Toronto, this 1st
day of February, 1950. Amount of License Fee $2.00

(Sgd.)                           F.R.
LONGSTAFF

Municipal
Treasurer

Below this appears a cash register printing
shewing $2.00 paid on February 1, 1950.

Counsel for the appellant objects that this has
no probative value in the absence of any evidence to identify the appellant
George Reid with the individual intended to be described by the words “Geo.
Reid” in the license. This point was not further developed in argument and I do
not

[Page 64]

propose to discuss the numerous decisions, some
of which are not easy to reconcile, in which the question has been considered
as to whether and to what extent identity of name is evidence of identity of
person. I will assume, without deciding, that a jury would have been entitled
to infer that the appellant George Reid was the individual described by the
words “Geo. Reid” in Exhibit 30. It might then be suggested that this indicated
that on February 1, 1950, the appellant Reid was the licensee permitted to
carry on business under the name “Lakeside Cigar Store” at the premises in
question and that the presence of Exhibit 30 on such premises on November 3,
1950 indicated that he had up to that date continued in charge of such
business. Be this as it may, it appears to me that if such an inference could
otherwise have been drawn it was displaced by the evidence given by the Crown
that Feeley was both the owner and the person in charge of the premises.

Item (ii) as to Reid seems to me to indicate
nothing more than that the appellant Reid had hung up his coat in a closet in
the premises in question and possessed a liquor permit. It throws no light on
the question as to what he was doing on the premises.

In my opinion, these three items of evidence,
taken together, are insufficient to make out a prima facie case that
Reid was in fact the keeper or that he appeared, acted or behaved as the person
having the care, government or management of the house in question or as
assisting in such care, government or management.

In the case of Hergel the evidence as to his
presence in the cellar in the circumstances mentioned, coupled with the
evidence as to his twice leaving and entering the premises, falls far short of
making out a prima facie case.

In the case of Meechan the evidence as to his
presence in the cellar and as to the possession of the two keys mentioned above
does not appear to me to indicate that he was a keeper. His possession of the
keys would permit the jury to infer that he had a right to enter the building
and a particular room therein, but would afford no foundation for a finding
that he took any part in its care, government or management.

[Page 65]

For the above reasons I have reached the
conclusion that as to the appellants Reid, Hergel and Meechan there was no
evidence on which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, might have
found a verdict of guilty.

I would dismiss the appeal of the appellant
Feeley. I would allow the appeals of the appellants Reid, Hergel and Meechan
and direct that as to each of them a judgment of acquittal be entered.

Appeal of the appellant Feeley
dismissed; appeals of the other appellants allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Illegal possession of
cigarettes—Admissibility of statement made by accused—Whether warning should
always be given.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, quashing the appellant's acquittal and
ordering a new trial.

J. Guy Blanchette and J. L. Peloquin
for the appellant.

Roland Dugré Q.C.
and Benoit Turmel for the respondent.

The Court:—We
agree with the members of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) all of whom
decided that the trial judge came to the conclusion that the statement made by
the appellant at Richmond was not free or voluntary because he, the trial
judge, considered that irrespective of all the circumstances it was necessary
that the appellant should have been previously warned. This is contrary to the
law as laid down by this Court in Boudreau v. The King 1
and, therefore, there was a right of appeal by the Crown from the acquittal.

On the basis of the evidence on the voir dire that appears
in the record, there is nothing to indicate what the trial judge would have
done as to the admissibility of the statement if he had not misdirected
himself. The appeal should therefore be dismissed so that a new trial may be
had.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Theft—Evidence—Testimony of
accomplice—Corroboration—Corroborative inference is question of fact—Criminal
Code , s. 1025 .

Applying Rex v. Baskerville [1916] 2
K.B. 658, it was held that, on a charge of theft, the jury were rightly told
that the evidence as to a certain cheque was capable of being corroborative of
the testimony of the accomplice who was the main witness against the appellant.
Applying Hubin v. The King [1927] S.C.R. 442, it was also held that the
jury should have been told that it was for them to decide if it was in fact
corroborative. As it was impossible to state that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage had occurred, the appeal was allowed and a new trial directed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his conviction on a
charge of theft.

A.E. Moloney for the appellant.

W.B. Common Q.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:—

KERWIN J.:—The appellant was convicted in the
Court of the General Sessions of the Peace in and for the County of York on a
charge that in the year 1950 he stole approximately $38,000 in money, the
property of S.P. Ryan, A.D. McAlpine and J.M. Ryan, contrary to the Criminal
Code . The Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed an appeal from his
conviction and sentence and, pursuant to section 1025 of the Code, he
appealed to this Court in accordance with leave granted by Cartwright J. on the
following grounds:—

(a) Was the alleged fact that a certain
cheque was given by the appellant to one, Elsie Teasdale, in or about the month
of April, 1950, capable in law of being corroboration of the testimony of the
said Elsie Teasdale?

(b) Did the learned trial judge
usurp the functions of the jury in instructing them that the evidence
concerning the said cheque was corroborative?

[Page 92]

In view of the conclusion reached, it is not
advisable to refer to the evidence at the trial in detail. The substance of the
charge against the appellant was that he had counselled and procured Elsie
Teasdale to steal the money in question from her employers, the parties named
in the indictment. Elsie Teasdale had already pleaded guilty to a charge of
theft and had been sentenced. She was the main witness called against the
appellant, and the trial judge charged the jury that as she was an accomplice
they ought not to convict on her uncorroborated testimony. He also told the
jury that the cheque given by the appellant to her in or about the month of
April, 1950, was capable in law of being such corroboration. This cheque could
not be found but, notwithstanding the argument of counsel for the appellant, we
are satisfied that there was evidence upon which the jury could find that it
had in fact been signed by the appellant and given to Elsie Teasdale.

Then it was said that while on her own testimony
the cheque was to repay the amounts she had given the appellant from her own
funds and from the sums she had stolen from her employers up to that time, the
amount of the cheque exceeded the total of all of these amounts down to the
date of the cheque. However, the jury were entitled to accept Elsie Teasdale’s
evidence that the amount of the cheque represented the approximate total and
that any excess was to be repaid by her to the appellant. In that view of the
matter and considering all the other evidence, the cheque was capable in law of
being corroborative as it falls within the classical statement as to what may
be corroboration as found in Rex v. Baskerville[1]. The answer, therefore, to the first
question must be in the affirmative.

The second question must also be answered in the
affirmative. The charge to the jury must, of course, be read as a whole but it
is necessary to refer only to the following portions of it. At one stage the
trial judge told the jury:—

I will tell you here there is some evidence
corroborative of her evidence and if you accept that evidence you may believe
her evidence, accept the whole of her story.

[Page 93]

Later, after referring to the evidence as to the
existence of the cheque given by the various bank officials, the trial judge
continued:—

Gentlemen, you may or may not accept that
evidence. If you do, that is evidence corroborative in a material respect and
you may believe the whole or necessary parts of Miss Teasdale’s evidence to
bring in a verdict. If you do not accept the evidence as corroborative of her
story, as I told you, you ought not to convict and should bring in a verdict of
not guilty.

After considering the matter for over four
hours, the jury returned and the foreman asked the following questions:—

... something was said about the fact that
it was unusual to convict person based on or solely on the evidence of a
convicted member or party to the offence. Could you perhaps go over that for us
again and clarify it just to what extent?

The trial judge replied:—

I am very glad you asked about that because
they are very important. You see, there is not enough evidence in this case,
gentlemen, to convict the accused unless you accept the whole or important
parts of the evidence of Miss Teasdale.

Now, as I have told you as a matter of law,
as I am supposed to tell you the law, she is in law what is known as an
accomplice, that is, if you find the accused guilty the two of them were both
in it, she is guilty anyway, she is what you call an accomplice. You realize
when you have two people accused of something there might be a tendency to put
the blame on the other so a person who is admittedly guilty of a crime may not
be too reliable, so the law is laid down that the judge must tell the jury they
ought not to convict the accused on the evidence of an accomplice alone, it
must be corroborated, that is, there must be some other evidence which backs it
up in some material particular.

I have explained to you here that there is
such evidence, which you accept it as corroboration, if you accept that
evidence you may take her story, holus bolus if you want to. It is all in your
hands; if there is no corroboration, I have to tell you there is not. Here I
explained what the corroboration was; it was the evidence concerning this
cheque which was signed by the accused which went through the bank. You heard
the evidence about that and if you believe that evidence and accept it, it is
open to you to accept the whole or any part of Miss Teasdale’s evidence.

Particularly bearing in mind this last
quotation, we think the charge was defective and that the jury should have been
told clearly that the evidence as to the cheque was

[Page 94]

capable of being corroboration but that it was
for them to decide if it was in fact corroborative. In Hubin v. The King[2], this Court decided, at page 444, that
“whether corroborative inferences should be drawn is a question for the jury.”
This rule was infringed in the present case and it is impossible to state that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage has occurred. This appeal must therefore be
allowed and a new trial directed.

Appeal allowed; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL
DIVISION

Criminal law—Murder—Drunkenness—Reasonable
doubt—Incapacity to form specific intent—Objections to charge of trial judge.

A jury found the appellant guilty of murder with ""the
strongest recommendation for mercy"". His appeal, mainly on grounds of
misdirections on the issue of drunkenness which he had raised at the trial, was
dismissed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, on the ground
that, though some of the involved directions might have been objectionable or
that the principles could have been more clearly worded, the evidence supported
no finding other than that of murder and that, in any event, no substantial
wrong or miscarriage had occurred.

Held (Rinfret C.J. and Locke J. dissenting) : That the
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

The instructions given to the jury were confusing, incomplete,
illegal and were not corrected. The appellant was not bound to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that drunkenness had produced a condition such as did render
his mind incapable of forming the pertinent specific intent essential to
constitute the crime of murder. Furthermore, the jury should have been clearly
instructed that the accused should only be found guilty of manslaughter if, in
their view, the evidence indicated such incapacity or left them in doubt as to the
matter. (Latour v. The King [1951] S.C.R. 19 referred to).

On the evidence, it cannot be safely asserted that the jury,
properly instructed and acting honestly and reasonably, might not have found
itself in. doubt as to the accused's incapacity, on account of drunkenness, to
form the specific intent to murder. The length of the jury's deliberation
coupled with the fact that they came back for further instructions as to the
effect of intoxication, support the view that drunkenness was at least
considered and support the conclusion that it is impossible to say that the
verdict would have necessarily been the same had they been properly instructed
that any reasonable doubt had to be given to the accused. There was substantial
wrong or miscarriage.

Rinfret C.J. and Locke J. (dissenting) agreed with the
unanimous judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New
Brunswick, and would have dismissed the appeal.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New
Brunswick, Appeal Division, maintaining the verdict of murder found by a jury
against the appellant.

J. T. Carvell for the appellant.

H. W. Hickman Q.C. for the respondent.

[Page 45]

The dissenting judgment of Rinfret C.J. and Locke J. was
delivered by

Locke, J.:—I
respectfully agree with the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division
delivered by Mr. Justice Hughes and would dismiss this appeal.

The judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey, Cartwright and
Fauteux JJ. was delivered by

Fatteux, J.:—On
the 6th day of March 1952, a. jury in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick
(Queen's Bench Division) presided over by Mr. Justice W. A. I. Anglin, after
four hours of deliberation, returned against the appellant a verdict of
guilty—to which they added ""the strongest recommendation for
mercy""—on the following charge:—

That Donald Capson, on or about the 2nd day of October A.D.
1951, at the City of Moncton, in the County of Westmorland, in the Province of
New Brunswick, did unlawfully murder Rosie Wing in violation of section 263  of
the Criminal Code  of Canada.

This verdict, appealed mainly on ground of misdirections on
the issue of drunkenness raised at trial by the accused, was unanimously
maintained by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, on the
view that, though some of the involved directions might be objectionable or
that the principles could have been more clearly worded, the evidence in the
case would support no finding other than that of murder and that, in any event,
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had actually occurred.

Leave was thereafter granted to the appellant to appeal to
this Court on two questions of law, namely:—

Did the trial Judge misdirect the jury as to the burden of
proof with respect to the defence of drunkenness?

Did the trial Judge misdirect the jury in omitting to direct
them that the accused was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt upon
the whole case, including the reduction of the crime of murder to manslaughter?

The directions in the address of the trial Judge that are attacked
are:—

(1) I must direct you that if you think the accused was so
intoxicated that he did not have the mind to appreciate what he was doing, then
the charge of murder may be reduced to manslaughter.

* * *

[Page 46]

(2) If he is so drunk that you are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt he did not know what he was doing because of the alcohol,
then it is impossible for you to say that he intended to murder. So, under
those circumstances, the law is that a charge of murder must then be reduced to
manslaughter.

* * *

(3) If, however, he has drunk so much he does not know what
he is doing at all and you are well satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
his mind is so blurred by liquor that he does not appreciate what he is doing
at all, then you are unable to find that he had any one of these intents which
I will speak to you about later, so a charge of murder would have to be reduced
to a finding of manslaughter.

* * *

(4) As I told you before, if you think that he had
enough to drink that he did not know what he was doing in respect of any of
these occasions when he must have a specific intent, then you may bring in a
verdict of manslaughter instead of murder.

* * *

(5) …and you have to be satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that his mind was so affected by liquor that he could not have meant
to inflict grievous bodily harm to facilitate robbery, if you say it was
robbery, or that he did not have the mind to intend to cause bodily injuries
known to him to be likely to cause death or that he was reckless whether death ensued
or not.

* * *

(6) But if you think that he had so much liquor during that
day that his mind was not in the state of appreciating what he was doing and
not just only influenced to do more readily and he would not probably have done
it, if he was sober, then you may find him guilty of manslaughter.

* * *

(7) So that if you think, not necessarily beyond a
reasonable doubt, but if you are satisfied that the influence of liquor was
such that he could not appreciate what he was doing in the sense that he could
not form the necessary intent to cause the death, then you may find him guilty
of manslaughter instead of murder.

With these instructions, the jury retired and returned, two
hours later, to ask the trial Judge ""to explain again the effect which the
different degrees of intoxication as regards to the accused, would have upon
the verdict of murder as distinguished from manslaughter."" The following
instructions were then given :—

(8) So in that intermediate stage you must satisfy
yourselves that the accused was so much under the influence of liquor that he
just could not be said to be capable or have the mental capacity to form any

of these specific intents…

* * *

(9) If he had so much liquor in him and his mind was so
affected that you can say he did not mean to cause her death then he would be
guilty of manslaughter only and not guilty of murder.

[Page 47]

It must be added that, with these conflicting instructions
related to doubt on the specific issue of drunkenness, the jury were not
instructed in a manner sufficiently clear that any reasonable doubt they might
have on the specific issue had to be given to the accused and that the verdict
should then be reduced from murder to manslaughter.

The jury retired again and after two more hours of further
deliberation, returned to give the above verdict and recommendation for mercy.

Appreciated in the light of well settled principles, as to
the burden of proof, in the matter, it is manifest that the instructions given
in this respect are confusing, incomplete and illegal. The appellant was not
bound to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that drunkenness had produced a
condition such as incapacitating his mind of forming the pertinent specific
intent essential to constitute the crime of murder. Furthermore, the jury
should have been clearly instructed that the accused should only be found
guilty of manslaughter if, in their view, the evidence indicated such
incapacity or left them in doubt as to the matter. (See Latour v. The
King 1
and authorities therein referred to).

The contention of the Crown that the instructions given were
innocuous or were corrected is, I think, undefendable.

The second submission of the Crown—accepted by the Court of
Appeal—is that there was no evidence upon which a jury could reasonably find
that the appellant's mind was incapacitated by drunkenness to form the intent
to commit murder; consequently, says counsel for the respondent, the jury
should not have been invited to consider the issue at all and even if the
directions given to them, in this respect, were illegal, no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice resulted therefrom since a verdict of manslaughter
could not, for the reason of drunkenness, be legally returned by the jury.

Since there is to be a new trial, no reference will be made
to the evidence.

In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the appellant entered
Rosie Wing's house ""probably with the idea of trying to make a loan of
some money""; but what took place from then on up to the moment at which
the injuries

[Page 48]

were inflicted is not apparent in the evidence. On any view
that would bring the case under the provisions of ss. (b) of s. 259  of
the Criminal Code , the jury, properly instructed and acting honestly and
reasonably, might have had no hesitation in finding that Capson was not, on
account of drunkenness, incapacitated to form the specific intent therein
provided, but it cannot safely be asserted that the jury, equally properly
instructed and acting honestly and reasonably, might not have found itself in
doubt on the point. The very fact that, after two hours of deliberation, the
jury required from the trial Judge further instructions as to ""the effect
which the different degrees of intoxication as regards to the accused, would
have upon the verdict of murder as distinguished from manslaughter"",
together with the fact that, after receiving such additional instructions, they
deliberated again for two more hours before bringing a verdict of murder
""with the strongest recommendation for mercy"" support the view that
drunkenness to some degree was at least considered and support the conclusion
that it is impossible to say that the verdict would have necessarily been the
same had they been properly instructed that any reasonable doubt had to be
given to the appellant. It was, therefore, necessary for the trial Judge to
instruct the jury on the issue of drunkenness and to do so according to law.

This conclusion also disposes of the ultimate contention of
the Crown that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice actually resulted
from the illegal manner in which the jury were instructed.

The appeal should be maintained and a new trial ordered.

Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Criminal law—Having
instruments for making bill paper—Whether the manufacturing of paper is
necessary—S. 471  (a) of the Criminal Code .

The having in one's possession
without lawful excuse instruments enabling one to fashion or change a piece of
white paper to resemble Bank of America's bill paper, is an offence within the
meaning of section 471  (a) of the Criminal Code .

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing appellant's appeal from his
conviction at trial before a jury on a charge of having had in his possession
instruments for making paper intended to resemble the bill paper of the Bank of
America, contrary to s. 471  (a) of the Criminal Code .

J. Stevenson Hall for the
appellant.

H. A. Maclean K.C. for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice
and of Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:

ESTEY J.:—The appellant was
convicted of having in his ""possession instruments for making paper
intended to resemble the bill paper of a body corporate carrying on the
business of banking, to wit, the Bank of America,"" contrary to the
provisions of s. 471 (a) of the Criminal Code . He was unsuccessful
in his appeal to the Court of Appeal in British
 Columbia and obtained leave, under s.
1025  of the Criminal Code , to appeal to this Court.

The instruments in his possession
enabled the accused to take a piece of white paper and make it into a Bank of
America traveller's cheque. Counsel for the accused submits that such instruments
are not included in s. 471 (a). He would construe this subsection to
include only those instruments which can be used for the manufacture of the
bill paper from its original ingredients and not, therefore,

[Page 538]

to include the making of a piece
of white paper into a bill paper intended to resemble the bill paper of the
Bank of America. S. 471 (a) reads:

471. Everyone is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to fourteen years' imprisonment who, without
lawful authority or excuse, the proof whereof shall lie on him,

(a) makes, begins to
make, uses or knowingly has in his possession, any machinery or instrument or
material for making exchequer bill paper, revenue paper or paper intended to
resemble the bill paper of any firm or body corporate, or person carrying on
the business of banking ;

The foregoing s. 471  follows in
the statute immediately after those dealing with the offence of forgery and is
included with those sections under the heading ""Forgery and Preparation
Therefor."" It is specifically directed against the preparation for a
forged bill and makes it an offence to be in possession of instruments, without
lawful authority or excuse, that may be used ""for making… paper intended
to resemble the bill paper of any firm or body corporate, or person carrying on
the business of banking.""

While ""exchequer bill
paper"" is defined in s. 335(k), bill paper generally, or that of a firm or
body corporate or person carrying on the business of banking, is not defined,
no doubt because each of these bodies selects its own particular bill paper.
The Bank of America, in making its traveller's cheques, used specially designed
paper. The acquisition or making of paper to resemble the bill paper of the
Bank of America would be a step toward, or in preparation of, a completed
forgery of its traveller's cheques. The accused was found to have in his
possession instruments with which he fashioned or changed a piece of white
paper, by impressions or other means, with intent that it would resemble the
bill paper upon which these traveller's cheques were made. It is the possession
of such instruments without lawful authority or excuse that the section makes
an offence.

The submission that, because the
instruments which were in the possession of the accused could not manufacture
bill paper which would resemble that of the Bank of America from its original
ingredients, but could only fashion or change white paper as already indicated,
the accused, in having them in his possession without lawful excuse, 

[Page 539]

had not committed an offence
contrary to s. 471  (a) is not tenable. The words ""making"" and
""manufacturing"" are sometimes used synonymously. The word
""making"" is, however, a wider term and somewhat more inclusive. The
mere physical fashioning or changing of a given commodity might, in some
circumstances, be described as manufacturing, but, in any event, it is a
making. The instruments in the possession of the accused enabled him to do just
that. He fashioned or changed the white paper with these instruments and made it
into that which he intended would resemble the bill paper of the Bank of
America. The language of this section cannot be given the narrow construction
suggested by counsel for the accused.

Counsel for the accused supported
his suggested construction of s. 471 (a) by reference to a number of
cases which were decided under the language of particular statutes and which,
therefore, do not materially assist in the construction of the section here in
question. In one of the more recent, Gamble v. Jordan[1] , the accused was charged with having flock in his
possession ""for the purpose of making"" certain articles. He had
received from his sister a mattress, the seams of which he had opened, and
""removed the flock with the intention of putting it back in the same covering.""
It was held that the accused was neither making nor manufacturing a mattress.
In the language of Avory J., at p. 153:

In one sense a new mattress
may be made out of a secondhand one; new covering may be put upon old stuffing,
or an old cover may be stuffed with new flock. Those are not the operations in
question.

The accused, in the case at bar,
was fashioning or changing a piece of white paper into a paper to be used for
an entirely new and different purpose and without the additions he made it could
not be so used. The white paper had to be changed or fashioned; in a word, it
had to be made to serve that new purpose.

Counsel for the accused referred
to ss. 14, 15, 16 and 20 of the Forgery Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 165. No
doubt these were present to the mind of Parliament when it enacted s. 471 (a)
(or rather its predecessor s. 434(a) in the Criminal Code  of 1892
R.S.C., c. 29), which is entirely different in its language and much wider in
its scope. The foregoing

[Page 540]

sections were drafted in more detail
and in that sense are limited in their application and no doubt more favourable
to the contention of counsel for the accused. It is not, however, from a
construction of the language of those sections but rather that of s. 471 (a)
that the submission of counsel on behalf of the accused must be determined. The
language of that section sets forth a clear intention on the part of Parliament
to make that which the accused here did an offence.

The appeal should be dismissed.

LOCKE J.:—I am of the opinion that
this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice O'Halloran
in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

APPEALS from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] quashing the conviction of each of the respondents
on the charge of being a habitual criminal.

H. A. Maclean K.C. for the
appellant.

T. F. Hurley and R. A.
Reid for the respondents.

The judgment of the Chief Justice
and of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux, JJ. was delivered by:

FAUTEUX J.:—The nature and the
course of proceedings, eventually leading to these four separate appeals, are
substantially alike in all of the cases. Each of the respondents was separately
indicted on two counts: one being that, at some definite time in 1950, in the
province of British Columbia, he was found in unlawful possession of drugs,
under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act 1929 as amended, and the second
one charging him to be a habitual criminal within the meaning of the provisions
of Part X(A) of the Criminal Code  of Canada. The first count—which is
not relevant to the point raised in the present appeal—was either admitted by
the accused or found by the jury. As to the second count, the accused pleaded
not guilty but were found guilty by the jury. An appeal, subsequently lodged
against the latter conviction, was unanimously maintained by the Court of
Appeal of the province[2] , which
quashed the conviction and directed a verdict of acquittal to be entered
thereon. Identical in all of the cases, the judgment rests on the
interpretation of the provisions of section 575(c) (1) (a) of
Part X(A). On this point, and under the authority of section 1025  of the Criminal
Code , leave to appeal to this Court was granted to the appellant.

It was agreed by counsel of all
interested parties that the argument made in the appeal of His Majesty the
King v. Gordon Robinson or Robertson—the first being called for
hearing—would apply in all the other cases.

The opposing contentions of the
parties, which are now to be considered, may more clearly be stated once the
relevant part of section 575(c) is quoted:

A person shall not be found
to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury as the case may be, finds on
evidence,

[Page 524]

(a) that since
attaining the age of eighteen years he has at least three times previously to
the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an
indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years'
imprisonment, whether any such previous conviction was before or after the
commencement of this Part, and that he is leading persistently a criminal life;
or

The submission of respondent,
which prevailed in the Court of Appeal, rests on an argument, centered solely
on the meaning of the words ""at least""—twice appearing in the above
provision—and purporting to implement the rule of literal interpretation. In
both instances the words are said to mean ""not less than"". ""Not
less than""—it may be pointed out—is the qualifying phrase used by
Parliament in relation to minimum mandatory sentences, which are few in number.
Paraphrasing the relevant part of the provision, in a manner strictly
consistent with the submission made, the provision would read: ""A person
shall not be found to be a habitual criminal unless it is found on the evidence
that, since attaining the age of eighteen years, he has not less than three
times, previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment,
been convicted of an indictable offence for which the minimum mandatory
punishment enacted is not less than five years' imprisonment."" In this
category, it may immediately be noted, there is only one offence in the Criminal
Code . The offence is dealt with in section 449 :—Stopping the mail with
intent to rob.

In the appellant's view, the
words ""at least"", in the context, mean ""as much as"" and the
questioned part of the provision should read: ""… unless… he has… been
convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable or exposed to suffer
as much as five years' imprisonment."" Thus, it is said, that, in the
context—and not detached therefrom—these words are indicative of a minimum
manifestly related to the maximum number of years of imprisonment which the
offender is liable or exposed to suffer as punishment. There are, in the Criminal
Code , some one hundred and eighty indictable offences for which the
offender is liable to receive as a maximum punishment a sentence of at least
five years' imprisonment.

The will of Parliament is well
manifested by the provisions of Part X(A) and the words ""at least"",
when read

[Page 525]

in the context, are, in my
respectful view, quite inapt to defeat the primary as well as incidental
purposes of this Part.

Part X(A) is new in our Criminal
Code . Enacted in 1947, by section 18 of the Criminal Code Amendment Act,
chapter 35, its provisions may be traced to Part II of the English Act assented
to on December 21, 1908, being 8 Edward VII Ch. 59, the unabridged title of which is: ""An
Act to make better provision for the prevention of crime and for that purpose
to provide for the reformation of young offenders and the prolonged detention
of habitual criminals and for other purposes incidental thereto.""

The primary purpose of Part X(A)
is best indicated by the following underlined words of section 575(b):—

Where a person is convicted
of an indictable offence committed after the commencement of this Part and
subsequently the offender admits that he is or is found by a jury or a judge to
be a habitual criminal, and the court passes a sentence upon the said offender,
the court, if it is of the opinion that, by reason of his criminal habits and mode
of life, it is expedient for the protection of the public, may pass a further
sentence ordering that he be detained in a prison for an indeterminate period
and such detention is hereinafter referred to as preventive detention and the
person on whom such a sentence is passed shall be deemed for the purpose of
this Part to be a habitual criminal.

It is equally provided—by section
575 (g)—that persons undergoing preventive detention may be confined in
a prison or part of a prison set apart for that purpose, to be subjected to
such disciplinary and reformative treatment as may be prescribed by the prison
regulations. In brief, the provisions of Part X(A) are clearly directed to
persons who, by reason of ""criminal habits and mode of life"", must,
for the protection of the public, be subjected to preventive detention, for an
indeterminate period. It is left to the Minister of Justice to ""review the
condition, history and circumstances of that person—once at least in every
three years—with a view to determining whether the person should be placed out
on license, and if so, on what conditions (s. 575 (h)).

What the Legislature considers as
being tantamount to ""criminal habits and mode of life justifying
preventive detention for the protection of the public"", is indicated in
the provisions of secton 575 (c) where a minimum requirement, expressed
in the form of several conditions, is estab-

[Page 526]

lished. Three of the conditions
which must be found on the evidence, before a person can be branded and dealt
with as a habitual criminal, are that :

(1) Since attaining the age of
eighteen years

(2) he has, at least three times
previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been
convicted of an indictable offence

(3) that is, not any indictable
offence but an indictable offence for the commission of which the offender is
liable to at least five years' imprisonment.

The corresponding section in the
English Act is section 10, which, in substance, prescribes that:

(1) Since attaining the age of
sixteen

(2) he has, at least three times
previously to the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been
convicted of a crime.

(3) which, according to ss. 6 of
section 10, comes within the definition of a crime as precised under the Prevention
of Crimes Act, 1871.

Thus, and under both Acts, it is
not the repeated commission of all kinds of offences which may cause an
offender to be found a habitual criminal. It is only the repeated commission of
such offences which are therein indicated. While such indication is, under
section 20 of the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871, achieved by various
ways, only one method to that end is used in Part X(A). The offences are not
identified by names or by reference to sections describing them, but by the
measure of punishment or, more precisely, by the maximum punishment which the
offender is exposed to suffer. And only those crimes for which the authorized
maximum punishment is at least five years' imprisonment come within the purview
of Part X(A). Again, in such category, there are, in the Criminal Code ,
some one hundred and eighty crimes while there is only the crime described in
section 449  for which the minimum mandatory sentence prescribed is five years'
imprisonment. If the appellant's submission is right, these one hundred and
eighty indictable offences are within the purview of Part X(A) which may then,
and for that reason, receive as general an application as the generality

[Page 527]

of the above quoted provisions
suggest it should. If, on the contrary, the submission of the respondents is
accepted, Part X(A) is inapplicable in the case of these one hundred and eighty
indictable offences and applicable only to the one indictable offence defined
in section 449.

That Parliament would have, in
1947, enacted all the provisions of Part X(A), and would further, by
incorporating it in the Criminal Code , have extended—by force of section
28 of the Interpretation Act—its application to other federal statutes
where indictable offences are created, with the sole object of dealing
exclusively with the now uncommon offence of stopping the mail with intent to
rob or search, is clearly untenable.

Can the intent of Parliament,
manifested by the above quoted provisions, be defeated on the alleged ground of
ambiguity or intractability of the language adopted by Parliament in the
following phrase of subsection (1) (a) of section 575(c)
""for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment""?

""It is quite true"",
says one of the learned members of the Court of Appeal, ""that when one reads
the subsection for the first time, the effect of the intractability of the
language may not be at once apparent; the dominant impression may be that it
simply excludes from its operation offences which do not merit imprisonment for
five years or more. But a check on this thinking reveals one cannot fix a
maximum of this kind if there is no minimum; the point at which the maximum
starts automatically fixes the minimum."" With this line of reasoning one
cannot disagree provided, in my respectful view, both the minimum and the
maximum are related to the same type of sentence. However that may be, this
reasoning does not solve the question for, in the appellant's submission, the
phrase ""for which he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment""
is related to the first kind of sentence above indicated and means ""for
which the authorized discretionary sentence is at least five years"" while,
in the respondents' view, it refers to the second kind of sentence and means
""for which the mandatory sentence is at least five years"". It thus
becomes apparent that the controlling word in the phrase is really the word
""liable"", and that the meaning of this word, in the ordinary language
as well as under the Code, must 

[Page 528]

then be ascertained to decide the
issue. Of the various imports ascribed to the word ""liable"" in The
Oxford English Dictionary, vol. VI, p. 234, the following are indicated:
""Exposed, or subject to, or likely to suffer"". Under the Code,
the provisions of section 1054 make it clear that Parliament has given to the
word ""liable"" a like practical significance. For this section reads:

Every one who is liable to
imprisonment for life, or for any term of years, or other term, may be
sentenced to imprisonment for any shorter term: Provided that no one shall be
sentenced to any shorter term of imprisonment than the minimum term, if any,
prescribed for the offence of which he is convicted.

The opening words of this section:
""Every one who is liable…"" are clearly in reference to similar words
used by Parliament in the pattern generally followed in the prescription of
punishment, as illustrated in the following section :

Every one is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who breaks and
enters any place of public worship, with intent to commit any indictable
offence therein.

(s. 456).

The words ""liable to seven
years' imprisonment"" in section 456, read in the light of the provisions
of section 1054, necessarily indicate an authorized but not a mandatory term of
imprisonment. And the words ""for which he was liable …"", in the new
enactment—section 575(c)—can only be related to similar words used in the
general pattern and must, thus, be presumed to be understood in the same sense.
The fact that the opposite view would entirely defeat what the above quoted
provisions of Part X(A) indicate as its clear object, is no reason to nullify
the presumption. That the word ""liable"" appears in few provisions—some
ten sections under the Code—where, by exception, a mandatory term is
prescribed, is of no avail as an argument against the above conclusion, for the
word ""liable"", in its proper sense, is there equally related to the
maximum authorized sentence to which the minimum mandatory term is attached. It
is also of some significance that in section 263, dealing with the
predetermined mandatory punishment for murder, the word ""liable"" is
not used.

In my respectful view, the
submission of the respondents cannot rest, as alleged, on the rule of literal
construction.

[Page 529]

As to the application of the
narrow construction doctrine, in the construction of penal statutes, this may
be said. The matter, in England, is deal with in Maxwell on Interpretation of
Statutes, 9th Edition, 1946, p. 267, in the following terms:

The rule which requires that
penal and some other statutes shall be construed strictly was more rigorously
applied in former times when the number of capital offences was very large (a),
when it was still punishable with death to cut down a cherry-tree in an
orchard, or to be seen for a month in the company of gipsies (b), or for
a soldier or sailor to beg and wander without a pass. Invoked in the majority
of cases in favorem vitae, it has lost much of its force and importance
in recent times, and it is now recognized that the paramount duty of the
judicial interpreter is to put upon the language of the Legislature, honestly
and faithfully, its plain and rational meaning and to promote its object.

In Canada, section 15 of the Interpretation
Act disposes of all discussion in the premises. This section, by force of
section 2, extends and applies to the Criminal Code  and the following words in
section 15  ""or to prevent or punish the doing of anything which it deems
contrary to the public good"" make it clear that its provisions embrace
penal as well as civil statutory provisions in any Canadian statute except if
there is inconsistency or a declaration of inapplicability.

The appeal of His Majesty against
each of the four respondents should be maintained, and the judgment of the
Court of Appeal should be quashed. This conclusion, however, does not bring
these cases to an end, for there were, before the Court of Appeal, other points
besides the one discussed herein on which the respondents are entitled to have
an adjudication. Adopting the course followed in The King v. Deur[3]
, and The King v. Boak[4]
, the cases should be remitted to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in order that it may pass upon these other grounds of appeal.

The judgment of Rand, Kellock and
Locke, JJ. was delivered by:

LOCKE J.:—The contention of the
Crown is that while the words ""at least"", where they first appear in
subsection (a) of section 575C(1) of the Criminal Code , are to be
construed as meaning ""not less than"", where they again appear
following the words ""liable to"", they are to be

[Page 530]

taken as meaning ""as much
as"". Thus, if the respondents were shown to have been convicted three
times or more of criminal offences for which the maximum permissible punishment
was five years' imprisonment or more, this condition of the section would be
complied with. The Court of Appeal[5] , has
unanimously rejected this contention, the learned judges all being of the
opinion that in the context the expression should be construed, where used for
the second time, in the same manner as when first used.

Since no mention is made of
section 15 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 1, in the reasons
for the judgment appealed from or in the factum of either party, I judge that
it was not argued in the Court of Appeal that the rules of statutory
construction prescribed by that section were to be applied. Mr. Justice
O'Halloran refers to the common law rules of construction but, while the result
may not be affected, I am of the opinion that it is to the statute we must
look. Section 15 reads:

Every Act and every
provision and enactment thereof, shall be deemed remedial, whether its
immediate purport is to direct the doing of any thing which Parliament deems to
be for the public good, or to prevent or punish the doing of any thing which it
deems contrary to the public good; and shall accordingly receive such fair,
large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the
attainment of the object of the Act and of such provision or enactment,
according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.

This section appears to have had
its origin in section 5 of c. 10, Statutes of Canada 1849 which was, with
minor differences which do not affect the meaning, expressed in the same terms.
It was reproduced in substantially the same form in section 6 of c. 5
Consolidated Statutes of Canada 1859 and appeared as the 39th paragraph of
section 7 of the Interpretation Act, passed at the First Session of the
Parliament of Canada in 1867, and has been continued in language identical in
meaning up to the present time. Section 3 of the Act as passed in 1867 provided
that section 7 and each provision thereof should extend and apply to every Act
passed in the session held in that year and in any future session of the
Parliament of Canada, except in so far as the provision was inconsistent with
the intent and object of the Act or the interpretation which

[Page 531]

such provision would give to any
word, expression or clause inconsistent with the context and except in so far
as any provision thereof in any such Act is declared not applicable thereto.
Section 2 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 1, declared that
the Act and every provision thereof should extend and apply to every Act of the
Parliament of Canada then or thereafter passed, with the like exceptions, and
the legislation was in this state when the Criminal Code  was first
enacted in 1892. Section 2 of the present Act is in like terms and its
application does not, in my opinion, restrict in any way the application of
section 15  to the language here to be construed.

Section 15 appears to me to be
substantially a restatement of the rules for the construction of statutes
contained in the Resolutions of the Barons in Heydon's Case[6]
. While in Attorney General v. Sillem[7]
, Pollock, C.B. said (p. 509) said that the rules of construction there stated
were not to be applied to a criminal statute which creates a new offence, this
argument is not available here to the respondents since the matter has been
dealt with by statute. The offence of being a habitual criminal is new to our
law. Clearly the language employed in defining it is capable of the
construction contended for by the respondents. This, if adopted, would lead to
the result that, unless the three offences or more proven against them were such
that the minimum permissible punishment was five years' imprisonment, they were
entitled to be acquitted. In re National Savings Bank Association[8]
, Turner, L.J. dealing with the construction of a clause in the Companies
Act 1862, said that he did not consider it would be consistent with the law
or with the course of the Court to put a different construction upon the same
words in different parts of an Act of Parliament, without finding some very
clear reason for doing so. There are dicta to the same effect by Cleasby, B. in
Courtauld v. Legh[9]
, and by Chitty, J. in Spencer v. Metropolitan Board of Works[10]
. In the present matter the clear indication that the words ""at
least"" are to be construed as meaning something else than ""not less
than"", where used the second time, must be

[Page 532]

found if at all in their
association with the word ""liable"" and it is really the sense in
which the latter word is to be understood in the context that determines the
matter.

In my opinion, the requirement
that statutes and their provisions are to be deemed remedial and that they
shall accordingly receive ""such fair, large and liberal construction and
interpretation"" as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the
Act does not mean that the object of the Act is not to be clearly manifest from
the language employed. The object of these amendments to the Criminal Code 
is to be ascertained by determining the identity of the persons against whom
they are directed. In accordance with the canons for the interpretation of statutes
the Act as a whole may be examined as an aid to the construction of the
language of the amending sections. As appears from section 575B  the legislation
is designed for the protection of the public against the danger inherent in
permitting habitual criminals being at large. While in sections 122 , 364 , 377 ,
449 , 510A , 542  and 1054A, minimum terms of imprisonment are provided for the
offences defined, in but one of these, section 449 , is the minimum permissible
term five years, and in none other is it more than this. In sections 122, 364,
449 and 510A the language is that the guilty person is ""liable to
imprisonment for a term not less than."" In 14 sections of the Code
where the prescribed punishment is or includes a fine and a minimum is
prescribed the words used are also ""not less than."" In none of the
sections is the minimum permissible term of imprisonment or fine expressed by
employing the expression ""at least"". Where, however, only the maximum
punishment by way of imprisonment which may be imposed is to be expressed, this
has been done in at least 260 other sections of the Code by saying that
the guilty person is ""liable to"" a penalty, leaving it to the
operation of section 1054 , which provides that anyone liable to imprisonment
for life or any other term may be sentenced to imprisonment for any shorter
term except where a minimum term is prescribed, to enable the Court to impose
imprisonment for any lesser term. While in some 35 other sections of the Code
the maximum term of imprisonment is defined by saying that it shall be for a
term 

[Page 533]

""not exceeding"" or
""not more than"" a stated period, this appears unnecessary in view of
the provisions of section 1054.

The persons to whom the habitual
criminal sections of the Criminal Code  are applicable are, if the
respondents' contention be accepted, only those who have on three occasions or
more been convicted of offences against section 449 , dealing with the offence
of stopping a mail with intent to rob or search the same, and presumably such
other offences for which there may hereafter be prescribed a minimum term of
five years' imprisonment. Construing the subsection in the manner contended for
by the Crown means that conviction on three or more occasions of any of the
many other offences described in the Code for which the maximum
imprisonment might be five years or more would comply with the subsection. The
language of section 575B  is that where a person is convicted of an indictable
offence committed after the commencement of the Part and subsequently admits
that he is, or is found by a jury or a judge, to be a habitual criminal:

the Court, if it is of the
opinion that by reason of his criminal habits and mode of life it is expedient
for the protection of the public, may pass a further sentence ordering that he
be detained in a prison for an indeterminate period.

It is habitual criminals as a
class against whom the public are to be protected. The words ""liable
to"", with the noted exceptions, being used throughout the Code to
indicate the maximum sentences which may be imposed, the expression
""liable to at least"" in subsection 575C(1) , in my opinion, conveys,
and was intended to convey, the meaning contended for by the Crown. It is
inconceivable to me that these new sections of the Code were directed against
the very limited class of criminals who would be affected if the respondents'
contention were correct. We are required by section 15 to interpret the
subsection in such manner as will best ensure the attainment of its object
according to its true intent, meaning and spirit, and to construe this language
in this manner is, in my judgment, not to legislate but to comply with the
directions of the statute.

I would allow these appeals and
refer each case back to the Court of Appeal, in order that the other grounds of
appeal raised before that Court may be there dealt with.

[Page 534]

CARTWRIGHT J.—The only question
raised on this appeal is as to the proper interpretation of section 575C  of the
Criminal Code . This section is found in Part XA dealing with habitual
criminals which was added to the Code in 1947 by 11 Geo. VI, c. 55,
section 18.

The section, so far as it is
relevant to this appeal, reads as follows:

575C. (1) A person shall not
be found to be a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury as the case may be,
finds on evidence,

(a) that since
attaining the age of eighteen years, he has at least three times previously to
the conviction of the crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an
indictable offence for which he was liable to at least five years'
imprisonment, whether any such previous conviction was before or after the
commencement of this Part, and that he is leading persistently a criminal life;
or …

The controversy is as to the
proper construction of the words ""been convicted of an offence for which
he was liable to at least five years' imprisonment.""

The respondent submits that these
words, construed in their ordinary and natural meaning, describe an indictable
offence as punishment for which the law prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence
of imprisonment for at least five years. The appellant submits that they
describe an indictable offence as punishment for which the maximum penalty
permitted by the law is imprisonment for five years or more.

The solution of the question
depends upon the meaning to be given to the words ""liable to"". Their
ordinary and natural meaning is, I think, ""exposed to"". The intention
of Parliament as disclosed in the words of the section seems to me to be to
describe a class of indictable offences, and to require as one of the
conditions of a person being found to be a habitual criminal that he shall at
least three times have been convicted of an offence comprised in such class.
The offences of which the class is composed are described by reference to the
penalty which the law permits to be inflicted on a person convicted thereof,
that is to say, the penalty to which he is exposed, which he runs the risk of
suffering, which he is subject to the possibility of undergoing, not the
penalty which he must suffer. Every indictable offence on conviction of which a
person may lawfully is the permissible maximum and not a mandatory minimum. be
sentenced to five years imprisonment or more is, I think, 

[Page 535]

included in the class described
and every indictable offence on conviction of which a person may not lawfully
be sentenced to so long a term of imprisonment as five years is, I think,
excluded.

Expressing my view in different
words, I think that the question an affirmative answer to which will determine
that a particular indictable offence falls within the class described is: Does
the law permit (not does the law require) the imposition on a person guilty of
such offence of a term of imprisonment of as much as or more than five years?

The meaning which I ascribe to
the word ""liable"" is given in the Oxford English Dictionary (1933)
Volume VI, page 235. In Black's Law Dictionary, 3rd Edition (1933), page 1103,
the meaning given is: ""Exposed or subject to a given contingency, risk or
casualty which is more or less probable"". In In re Soltau's Trusts[11]
, North J. agreeing with a decision of Stirling J. in an earlier case held that
the expression ""is liable to be laid out in the purchase of land""
does not mean ""has to be laid out in the purchase of land"" but means
""subject to some disposition under which it may be laid out in the
purchase of land"".

If the words of the section only
were to be considered it would be my view that their natural meaning is that
attributed to them by the appellant. We are not, however, limited to a
consideration of the words of the section. In order to ascertain the intention
of Parliament we must construe the statute as a whole and not one part only by
itself. The great majority of the sections in the Criminal Code  which define
indictable offences and prescribe the penalties therefor are in the following
form: ""Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to—years'
imprisonment who …"". Section 1054 of the Code provides as follows:

1054. Every one who is
liable to imprisonment for life, or for any term of years, or other term, may
be sentenced to imprisonment for any shorter term: Provided that no one shall
be sentenced to any shorter term of imprisonment than the minimum term, if any,
prescribed for the offence of which he is convicted.

In my opinion a consideration of
such sections strengthens the view that the words ""liable to""
followed by a stated term of years' imprisonment mean that such term In so far
as Parliament may be said to grade offences, in the Criminal Code , according to
their seriousness it does

[Page 536]

so by fixing for each a
permissible maximum sentence leaving it within the power and discretion of the
Court, before which a person is convicted, to impose such lesser sentence as
the particular circumstances may warrant, subject in the case of a few offences
to a prescribed minimum. The words with which we are concerned appear to me to
mean that no person shall be found to be a habitual criminal unless proved to
have been convicted at least three times of an offence so serious that the
permissible maximum sentence therefor is at least five years' imprisonment.
They set a minimum in the field of permissible maxima.

It will next be observed that the
Code contains only one offence, that described in section 449, for which
a mandatory minimum sentence of as much as five years' imprisonment is
prescribed. The words of a statute must be construed so as to give the statute
a sensible meaning if possible. Here the construction for which the appellant
contends gives the statute a sensible and effective meaning while that for
which the respondent argues would render Part XA without effect.

In my opinion if the words of an
enactment which is relied upon as creating a new offence are ambiguous, the
ambiguity must be resolved in favour of the liberty of the subject, but whether
or not such ambiguity exists is to be determined after calling in aid the rules
of construction. I have reached the conclusion that the words of the section
construed with the aid of the applicable rules, mentioned above, leave no room
for doubt as to the intention of Parliament, and that such intention is that
for which the appellant contends.

I would allow this appeal and
those in the cases of His Majesty the King v. McKenna, His Majesty
the King v. Cuthbert and His Majesty the King v. Beatty
which it was agreed should abide its result and refer each case back to the
Court of Appeal so that the other grounds of appeal, raised in that Court, may
be dealt with.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Manslaughter—Operation of motor
vehicle—Verdict of criminal negligence—Substituted by Court of Appeal for
dangerous driving—Whether dissent in Court of Appeal within section 1023(1)  of
Criminal Code —Sections 285(6) , 951(3) , 1016(2)  and 1023(1)  of the Criminal
Code .

In 1948, appellant was tried before a jury on a charge of
manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The jury,
implicitly acquitting him of that offence, returned a verdict of guilty of
criminal negligence. The Court of Appeal was unanimously of the opinion that
this verdict could not stand and the majority, therefore, basing itself on
sections 1016(2) , 951(3)  and 285(6)  of the Criminal Code , substituted a
verdict of guilty of dangerous driving. The minority, expressing a doubt as to
whether section 1016(2)  applied and not wanting to speculate as to what the
jury intended by their verdict, would have acquitted the accused.

Held: (Affirming the judgment appealed from) Locke and
Cartwright JJ. dissenting, that the appeal should be dismissed as the dissent
in the Court of Appeal was not on any ground of law dealt with by the majority,
and upon which there was a disagreement in the Court of Appeal. (Expressing a
doubt is not dissenting).

[Page 249]

Per the Chief Justice, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: As
an appeal under s. 1023(1)  of the Criminal Code  is limited to grounds of
law alone, upon which there were points of difference in the Court of Appeal,
and as the ground raised by the minority, assuming that it was a ground of law
alone, was not considered by the majority because of the view they took of the
case, there was, therefore, no disagreement in the Court of Appeal on a
question of law alone and this Court has, consequently, no jurisdiction to
entertain the appeal.

Per Locke and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting): The appeal
should be allowed and a new trial ordered as the Court of Appeal had no right
to substitute a verdict of dangerous driving under 1016(2) since, because of
errors in law in the charge, this verdict could not have stood even if the jury
had found it.

Per Locke and Cartwright JJ. (dissenting): To give this
Court jurisdiction to entertain an appeal under s. 1023(1) , it is not necessary
that the dissenting judgment upon which the appeal is based proceeded upon a
point of law with which the majority also dealt and upon which the majority and
the dissenting judges were in disagreement, but it is sufficient under that
section that (a) there be a dissenting judgment and (b) that a
ground upon which such dissenting judgment is based be a question of law.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1, substituting, Letourneau C.J.A. and
Barclay J.A. dissenting, for a jury's verdict of guilty of criminal negligence
a verdict of dangerous driving of an automobile pursuant to section 285  of the Criminal
Code , affirming the sentence passed by the trial judge and dismissing the
appeal.

Jean Drapeau for the
appellant.

Noel Dorion K.C. and Lucien
Thinel for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau and
Fauteux J.J. was delivered by

Fauteux J.—The
appellant has been charged with the offence of manslaughter, arising out of the
operation of a motor vehicle on the 17th of October 1947, in the district of
Terrebonne, Province of Quebec. On the 26th of October 1948, the jury,
implicitly acquitting him of the major offence of manslaughter, returned a
verdict expressed in the following terms: ""guilty of criminal
negligence."" The record does not disclose any objection being taken to the
verdict, either as to its form or as to its substance, at the time it could
have been corrected.

[Page 250]

About two weeks later, Rozon appealed to the Court of King's
Bench (Appeal Division) 2 on questions of. law alone. There was no
appeal on questions of fact or mixed law and fact nor was there any leave
granted or even asked to appeal on such questions. Of the three grounds raised
on law, one was that the accused having been indicted for manslaughter as the
result of the operation of a motor vehicle, the verdict of criminal negligence
was illegal.

By a majority judgment (St.-Jacques, Gagné and
MacKinnon (ad hoc), JJ.), that appeal was dismissed; a verdict of reckless driving
was substituted for the one expressed by the jury and the sentence imposed by
the trial judge was allowed to stand. Mr. Justice Barclay, with the concurrence
of the late Chief Justice Létourneau, expressed a dissent
clearly limited to the manner in which the appeal should be disposed of in view
of the illegality of the verdict expressed by the jury: They would have allowed
the appeal and quashed the conviction and the sentence. Thus, there was no
dissent as to any of the grounds of appeal raised by the appellant in the Court
below and, in point of fact, all the judges, as appears by the following
excerpts from the reasons for judgment, agreed that the accused could not, on
the indictment, be found guilty of criminal negligence. Mr. Justice St.-Jacques,
in reference to the accused, said:

Il soutient que depuis l'amendement apporté en
1938, à l'article 951  du Code
Criminel , un verdict de négligence criminelle sous l'autorité de l'article 284 
ne peut plus être rendu. Ainsi formulée, la proposition de l'appelant
n'est pas discutable; il faut l'admettre comme bien fondée.

Mr. Justice Gagné:

Comme M. le Juge St.-Jacques et M. le Juge
Barclay, dont j'ai eu l'avantage de lire les notes, je crois qu'en vertu des amendments
adoptés aux articles 951  et 285 , en 1938, l'appelant ne pouvait pas être condamné
pour négligence criminelle.

And, then, Mr. Justice MacKinnon:

I am in agreement with the Hon. Messrs. Justices
St.-Jacques, Barclay and Gagné, whose notes I have had the
opportunity of reading and for the reasons given by them that the appellant
could not be found guilty of ""criminal negligence"" on this charge.

Though no reference is made to ss. 2  of section 1016  of the Criminal
Code , either in the formal judgment or in the reasons for judgment of Mr.
Justice St.-Jacques who wrote

[Page 251]

it, it appears from the reasons for judgment delivered by
the other members of the Court that the dissent is related to this section, in
respect of which the only two questions considered were:

1. Whether section 1016 ss. 2 is, in law, applicable to
the case and, if it is,

2. Whether or not, being applied, the substitution of
verdict could properly be made in the light of the actual finding and the facts
of the case.

It is convenient to quote ss. 2 of section 1016 and, then,
relate the views expressed on the two points by the members of the Court.

2. Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and
the jury or, as the case may be, the judge or magistrate, could on the
indictment have found him guilty of some other offence, and on the actual
finding, it appears to the Court of Appeal that the jury, judge or magistrate
must have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty of that other
offence, the court of appeal may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal,
substitute for the verdict found a verdict of guilty of that other offence, and
pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed by the trial court
as may be warranted in law for that other offence, not being a sentence of
greater severity.

Mr. Justice St.-Jacques first deals with the facts of the
case, then with the charge, and finally, without referring in terms to ss. 2 of
section 1016, concludes, as in the formal judgment, that the jury, really
intending to return a verdict of reckless driving, ill expressed themselves in
wording it: ""guilty of criminal negligence."" At page 150, the learned
judge says:

Lorsque ce verdict a été
rendu, le président du tribunal aurait pu ordonner au jury
de le libeller, suivant la preuve et la direction donnée, à savoir: conduite
dangereuse ou désordonnée d'une automobile suivant les expressions que l'on
retrouve au cours de la charge. Il ne l'a pas fait. Sans doute, parce que tout
le monde a compris, à ce moment-là, qu'il s'agissait bien, malgré la rédaction
du verdict, de l'offense prévue à l'article 285 .

Je ne puis admettre que ce verdict doive être
cassé et mis à néant; il peut être modifié dans sa rédaction, sans en affecter
la substance qui ressort clairement, et de la preuve et de la charge du juge.

Messrs. Justices Gagné and MacKinnon
are clearly of the opinion that the section is applicable
to the case and applying it, conclude that the substitution is justified by the
finding and the facts of the case. Thus, at page 160, the former says:

Il s'agit de savoir si cette Cour a le pouvoir
de modifier le verdict pour le rendre conforme au paragraphe 6  de l'article 285 . L'article 1016 , paragraphe 2 , nous le permet.

[Page 252]

And, having considered the address of the trial judge, he
concludes, at page 163, to the substitution of a verdict:

Comme on le voit, le savant juge confond, dans les remarques qui suivent la lecture de l'article 285 ,
par. 6 , la négligence criminelle, ou
coupable, et ce qu'il appelle la conduite désordonnée d'une automobile. Mais,
tout cela est en relation avec l'offense prévue au dit paragraphe qu'il a lu en
entier.

Le jury n'a pas pu comprendre qu'il puisse
s'agir d'autre chose. L'expression employée au verdict est impropre, mais c'est
bien l'offense de conduite dangereuse que le jury avait à considérer, et c'est
de cette offense qu'il a voulu déclarer l'accusé coupable.

Finally, referring to the evidence, the learned judge says:

Ce qui s'est passé avant et après l'accident,
d'après la preuve, et l'état du cadavre lorsqu'on l'a trouvé, démontrent de façon
tellement évidente la culpabilité de l'appelant, que le jury n'a pas pu être
influencé par les quelques inexactitudes que signale le savant procureur.

Mr. Justice MacKinnon, at page 166,
states:

I consider that under Art. 1016, paragraph 2, C.C., this Court
has the right to substitute for the verdict as found a verdict of guilty of an
offence under paragraph 6 of Art; 285, C.C.

And, at the same page, on the second point, he concludes :

As pointed out by the Hon. Messrs. Justices St.-Jacques and Gagné, the judge in his address to the jury made no reference to
Art. 284 which defines criminal negligence. He did however read to the jury
paragraph 6 of Art. 285  C.C. which deals with reckless driving. To me it is
evident that taking the judge's charge as a whole that he intended to direct
the jury that it could bring in a verdict of guilty of manslaughter or reckless
driving and that it was the offence of reckless driving which the jury
considered when it found the appellant guilty of criminal negligence. For the
reasons given by Messrs. Justices St.-Jacques and Gagné, with
which I concur, I would substitute for the verdict given a verdict of guilty of
reckless driving and would allow the sentence to stand.

For the minority judges, Mr. Justice Barclay did not consider
the facts at all. Dealing first with the second point, he concludes, at page
159:

… With all these directions to the jury, I am of the opinion
that speculation as to what they really intended would be most unfair to the
accused.

And, dealing then with the first point, he expresses a
doubt:

I am also very doubtful as to whether Article 1016-2 is
applicable to the present case.

And he ends his notes of judgment in saying:

I consider therefore that we have no right to substitute any
other verdict.

[Page 253]

On the alleged basis of this dissent and under the
provisions of ss. 1 of section 1023, Rozon now appeals to this Court,
formulating as follows his grounds of appeal: 

(a) The verdict of criminal negligence was
illegal in view of the indictment for manslaughter resulting from an automobile
accident against the appellant in the present case; 

(b) The Court of Appeal erred in substituting as
it did a verdict of reckless driving to the verdict of criminal negligence
rendered by the jury; 

(c) The Court of Appeal, for the reasons
mentioned in the foregoing grounds of appeal, should have quashed the
conviction. 

It may, at first, be stated that the sole question of law,
if any, on which a dissent may be suggested by the appellant to establish the
jurisdiction of this Court and its limit is in ground (b). For it
clearly appears from the above excerpts from the various reasons for judgment
that there is no dissent as to ground (a) and what is alleged as ground
(c) does not point to a dissent but to the manner in which the appeal
should have been disposed of had the majority agreed with the minority that the
substitution was not appropriate under ss. 2 of section 1016.

So, whether, on the issue, the different conclusions reached
by the majority and the minority groups in the Court below rest on a point of
difference on a question of law and, if so, the merit of such point of law, are
the matters to be considered. For this purpose, what was said by the members of
the Court below as to each of the three features conditioning the exercise of
the special powers given to the Court of Appeal under ss. 2 of section 1016,
may now be examined.

The first condition is that the appellant must have been
convicted of an offence. The appellant contended that the existence of this
condition is not established because the offence of which he was found guilty
by the jury— criminal negligence—was not, in the case at bar, an offence
included in the indictment. Mr. Justice Barclay dealt with this point but left
it as above indicated with no conclusion but simply the expression of a doubt.
And if the sentence at the very end of his reasons: ""I consider there-

[Page 254]

fore that we have no right to substitute any other
verdict"" cannot, because of inconsistency with the doubt expressed, be
related to the point being considered, I should not hesitate to say that there
is no dissent within the meaning of section 1023 and, consequently, no
jurisdiction for this Court to deal with this point for dubitante is not
tantamount to dissentiente. (The King v. Bailey et
al 3).

Assuming, however, that this conclusion with respect to the
lack of right to substitute another verdict could be related to the point under
discussion, and that our jurisdiction cannot otherwise be questioned, I must
confess that I fail to see the difficulty. Again the first condition reads:
""Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence …"" It does not
read: ""Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence included in
the indictment."" To accept the appellant's suggestion would be
tantamount to add a qualification to the first condition. It would equally
curtail the field of the operation of the section to the limits of the
authority assigned in section 951  to a jury to bring a verdict of guilty for a
lesser offence. That ss. 2 of section 1016 includes a like power for a Court of
Appeal is certain but it goes further for the second condition to its
applicability does not read: ""And if the jury could, on the indictment,
have found him guilty of a lesser offence,"" but reads: ""… of some
other offence."" In brief, the evident purpose of the section is to
authorize the Court of Appeal to give effect to the finding of the jury or of
the trial judge, if at all possible within the conditions prescribed. And such
authority is consistent with the principle governing the disposal of appeals in
criminal matters that, failing miscarriage of justice or substantial wrong, the
appeal generally should be dismissed, even if it might, on the grounds raised,
be decided in favour of the appellant.

The second condition to the right of substitution is that it
must have been open to the jury on the indictment to find the appellant guilty
of the offence proposed in substitution. The provisions of ss. 3 of section 951 
were specifically enacted for the purpose of giving the authority to find
""reckless driving"" and this verdict, substituted by the Court of
Appeal, is precisely the only one, the appellant

[Page 255]

contended, which could—failing a verdict of manslaughter or
an acquittal—have been rendered on the indictment. As to the second condition,
there is not even a discussion.

The third condition is that, on the actual finding, it must
appear to the Court of Appeal that the jury must have been satisfied of facts
which proved the appellant guilty of that other offence,—in the premises,
reckless driving. From their reasons for judgment, it is clear that the judges
of the majority have exhaustively dealt with all the material available in the
record to consider and answer the question implied in this condition. To that
end, and to that end only—for there was then no other issue legally before the
Court—they considered the verdict expressed by the jury, the facts revealed in
the evidence put before the latter, and the address of the trial judge. They
ultimately concluded that, on the actual finding of ""criminal
negligence,"" not only was it clear to them that the jury were satisfied of
facts which proved the appellant guilty of the offence of ""reckless
driving,"" but that there was no other rational conclusion. In point of
fact, they formed the opinion that, as expressed in the formal judgment, the
jury ill expressed themselves.

For the minority judges, Barclay J. proceeded on quite a
different basis with, naturally, quite a different result. He completely dismissed
from his examination the facts proven. Dealing simply with the address of the
trial judge and finding confusion as a result of some misdirections— which were
not in issue as such but which he found—he concluded:

With all these directions to the jury, I am of opinion that
speculation as to what they really intended would be most unfair to the
accused.

And, at the end, he said:

I consider that we have no right to substitute any verdict.

In substance, and as I read it, the dissent of the minority
rests on the view that the Court of Appeal cannot, as a matter of law,
substitute a verdict under section 1016 subsection 2  when speculation, needed
to ascertain what the jury intended by their actual verdict, would, because of
misdirections, be unfair to the appellant.

[Page 256]

In brief, what was really intended by the jury—this was the
issue and this cannot be a question of law alone—was clear to the majority,
while it was obscure to the minority the members of which, for the reason they
indicated, refused to speculate.

It is thus manifest that with different elements in mind in
the consideration of the question in issue,—the members of the minority
dismissing the evidence from the study of the question,—the members of the
Court naturally had a different view of the same and for reasons entirely
unrelated, were led, in the result, to a different conclusion. And while the
decision of the majority rests on a question of fact, i.e., the intent of the
jury, the dissent of the minority rests on the question of law above stated. On
this point of law expressed by the latter, the former never dissented either
expressly or by implication. Nor did, upon the view they took, even the
occasion to consider the point of law ever arise.

The appeal to this Court being taken under subsection 1  of
section 1023, as enacted in 1925 c. 38 s. 27 in substitution to the relevant
part of what was then section 1024, it is convenient to quote the material
parts of the two sections and a few of the decisions of this Court rendered
thereunder with respect to the limits of the jurisdiction of this Court in the
matter.

Before 1925, section 1024 read:

Any person convicted of any indictable offence whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section 1013, may appeal
to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction:
Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the Court of Appeal is unanimous
in affirming the conviction …

In Davis v. The King 4, Newcombe,
J., delivering the judgment of the majority, said, at page 526, in reference to
section 1024 above:

The interpretation of the latter section has frequently been
considered by this Court and it is established by a long and practically
uniform course of decision which has become firmly embedded in the practice of
the Court that the only questions open to consideration upon appeals under that
provision are the points of difference between the dissenting judge or
judges and the majority of the Court of Appeal.

[Page 257]

Subsection 1  of section 1023, applicable to this case,
reads:

Any person convicted of any indictable offence whose
conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section 1013, may appeal
to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction on any
question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.

It may be observed that the latter provision, clearer in
this respect than the former, does not read ""any question of law in the
dissent"" but reads ""any question of law-ore which there has
been dissent in the Court of Appeal.""

In Manchuk v. The King 5, the
appeal being taken upon subsection 1  of section 1023 above, Sir Lyman Duff, the
then Chief Justice, delivering the judgment of the majority, said at page 346:

The appeal is, by law, necessarily limited to the grounds
upon which the learned judges dissented.

In The King v. Décary 6, the same learned jurist, again delivering the
judgment for the Court, stated at page 82:

It is well settled by the decision of this Court that such
grounds must raise the question of law in the strict sense and that it is not a
competent ground of appeal if it raises only a mixed question of fact and law.

And having proceeded to compare the reasons for judgment of
the majority with those of the minority, in order to find the points of difference on law, Sir Lyman concluded with respect to the
reasons of the former:

It is quite plain that the judgment does not rest upon any
view of the majority upon a question which is a question of law alone.

And with respect to the reasons of the latter: 

Turning now to the judgment of the minority, Mr. Justice
Hall simply says: ""I am of opinion that this appeal should be
dismissed."" Plainly there is no dissent upon any question of law. Mr.
Justice Walsh, in the reasons delivered by him for his conclusion that there
should be a new trial, does not say either expressly or by implication, that
this conclusion is based upon an opinion that the majority proceeds upon any
error in point of law alone.

Being of opinion that the judgment of the majority in this
case does not rest upon a question of law alone and that the judgment of the
minority rests on a question of law upon which there was no expressed or
implied dissent from the majority, I must conclude that it is not within the
jurisdiction of this Court to review the answer given

[Page 258]

by the Court of Appeal to the question implied in the third
condition of section 1016 subsection 2 .

For the appellant, it was suggested, at first, that the
point of law ultimately raised by the minority is that subsection 2  of section
1016 cannot apply to a case where, the verdict proposed in substitution to the
actual verdict would, on the state of the record, have been bad in law, had it
been found by the jury. And then, it was said that the minority effectively
found misdirections which, in their views, could have vitiated the verdict of
reckless driving, had it been rendered.

With respect to the first branch of this contention, I must
say with deference, that I am unable to read this proposition of law as being
either expressed or implied in the views of the minority. It is certainly not
expressed and, even if and with the necessity of involved construction, it
could be said to be implied, again I should not fail to observe that the
members of the majority, because of the view they took, never considered nor
had to consider this proposition for the conclusion they reached and,
therefore, never dissented upon it.

As to the second branch of the contention, it must be
assumed that, had this been the reasoning of the minority, they would not have
failed—as they did—to deal with the facts of the case in order to consider
whether or not, in the light of the principle of subsection 2 of section 1014,
the result, notwithstanding these misdirections, would inevitably have been the
same. And in the event of a doubt on this question, they would, in view of the
evidence on the record, have ordered a new trial.

I may finally add that, if an affirmative conclusion, as to
the existence of such a dissent within the meaning judicially approved of
section 1023 could have been reached, it would then have been necessary, in the
consideration of the merit of the alleged point of law, to note that this Court
in the Manchuk case 7 applied subsection 2  of section 1016
though clearly of the opinion that there were, in the address of the trial
judge, misdirections amounting, in the result, to a mistrial.

For the above reasons, the appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 259]

The dissenting judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was
delivered by

Cartwright J.—This
is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) of the
Province of Quebec 8 pronounced on the 12th of May, 1949,
substituting for a verdict of ""guilty of Criminal Negligence"" a
verdict of ""Dangerous driving of an automobile pursuant to section 285  of
the Criminal Code "", affirming the sentence passed by the learned
trial judge and dismissing the appeal. Létourneau C.J. and
Barclay J. dissenting would have allowed the appeal and directed the acquittal
of the accused.

The appellant was tried before Cousineau J. and a jury on a
charge of manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. The
jury brought in a verdict of guilty of criminal negligence. This verdict was
entered and the appellant was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment. An
appeal was taken, the grounds of appeal being as follows:

1. Le verdict de
négligence criminelle était illégal vu l'acte d'accusation porté contre
l'appelant dans la présente cause;

2. Les commentaires illégaux du procureur
de la Couronne dans son adresse aux jurés sur le fait que l'accusé n'a pas
témoigné et le refus du président du Tribunal d'arrêter les procédures et
d'ordonner un nouveau procès, tel que demandé par le procureur de l'appelant;

3. Le président du Tribunal a erré dans sa
charge aux jurés en omettant de leur donner les directives requises par la loi
dans le cas de preuve de circonstances.

The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the verdict of
guilty of criminal negligence could not stand and the correctness of that holding
was not questioned before us. It is, I think, clear that, as a matter of law,
on an indictment for manslaughter arising out of the operation of a motor
vehicle only three verdicts are possible, (i) guilty of manslaughter, (ii)
guilty of the offence created by section 285(6)  of the Criminal Code  (which
by implication is a finding of not guilty on the charge of manslaughter);

[Page 260]

or (iii) not guilty. The majority of the Court of Appeal
were of opinion that the proper course was to substitute a verdict of guilty of
dangerous driving, pursuant to section 285(6) , taking the view that this course
was authorized by the provisions of section 1016(2) of the Code.

From this judgment the appellant appeals to this court, the
grounds of appeal being stated as follows:

The grounds of law on which the present appeal is based are
those set forth in the dissenting judgment of the Honourable Messrs. Justices
Barclay and Létourneau of the Court of King's Bench,
Appeal Side, for the Province of Quebec, which heard the case and in the formal
judgment of the other judges and also those mentioned in the appeal, to wit:

A) The verdict of criminal negligence was illegal in view of
the indictment for manslaughter resulting from an automobile accident against
the appellant in the present case;

B) The Court of Appeal erred in substituting, as it did, a
verdict of reckless driving to the verdict of criminal negligence rendered by
the jury;

C) The Court of Appeal, for the reasons mentioned in the
foregoing grounds of appeal, should have quashed the conviction;

I agree with the view of Barclay J. that the Court of Appeal
had no right to substitute a verdict of guilty of dangerous driving.

It must, I think, be clear that the Court of Appeal can
convict an accused of an indictable offence of which he has not been convicted
by the court of first instance only if statutory authority can be found for
such a course. It is suggested that such authority is conferred by section
1016(2) .

Before section 1016(2) can be effective to confer this power
upon the court in an appeal following a trial by jury there appear to be three
conditions which must exist.

(1) The appellant must have been convicted of an
offence.

(2) It must have been open to the jury on the
indictment to have found him guilty of some other, offence.

(3) It must appear to the Court of Appeal on the actual
finding that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the
accused guilty of such other offence.

In the case at bar it is evident that the second condition
set out above is satisfied.

[Page 261]

Dealing with the first condition mentioned above, Mr. Drapeau argues that the offence of which the appellant has been
convicted must be an offence of which it was possible in law that he could be
convicted on the indictment and that a conviction of an offence neither charged
nor included in the indictment is a legal nullity and not a conviction at all.
We were not referred to any case in which this argument appears to have been
considered and I have not been able to find one. I have examined a number of
cases decided either under section 1016(2)  of the Criminal Code  or under
section 5(2) of the English Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, 7 Edward VII c. 23,
which is in substantially the same words, but I have found only one in which it
appeared that the verdict for which a different verdict was substituted was one
which could not in law have been found on the indictment. The case to which I
refer is The King v. Quinton 9 affirming 1947 O.R. 1. In
that case the accused was tried on an indictment charging attempted rape. The
jury returned a verdict of ""guilty of assault on a female causing actual
bodily harm."" The Court of Appeal for Ontario held unanimously, and it was
apparently not disputed in this court, that the last mentioned offence is not
included in a charge of attempted rape, the only other offences included in
that charge being indecent assault and common assault. The Court of Appeal
substituted a conviction for common assault and passed a lesser sentence. The
Crown appealed to this court arguing that a conviction for indecent assault
should have been substituted. The appeal was dismissed. There is nothing in the
reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal or of this court to indicate that
the argument put forward in the case at bar by Mr. Drapeau was
advanced or considered and the point appears to me to be still open for
consideration in this court. I do not find it necessary to pass upon it in this
appeal and I think it very doubtful whether it is open for our consideration in
view of the manner in which the dissenting judgments are expressed.

In my view the third condition mentioned above is not
fulfilled in the case at bar. It will be observed that it

[Page 262]

must appear to the Court of Appeal on the actual finding
that the jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the appellant
guilty of a breach of section 285(6) . 

In determining whether on the actual finding the jury must
have been satisfied of facts which proved the accused guilty of such offence no
doubt the Court of Appeal would find it necessary to examine the evidence and
the charge of the learned trial judge. If, in the course of such examination,
it should appear that there was error in law in the charge, so grave that had
the jury found a verdict of guilty of dangerous driving it must have been set
aside on appeal, I think that section 1016(2)  would not empower the Court of
Appeal to enter such a verdict. The section must, I think, contemplate a
situation where if the jury had found the verdict proposed to be substituted
such verdict would on the state of the record have been good in law. To hold
otherwise would bring about the startling result that the Court of Appeal could
substitute for a verdict, which for some reason can not stand, another verdict
which if the jury had found it must have been set aside.

In my view, for the reasons given by Barclay J., because of
what was, I think, a fatal defect in the charge of the learned trial judge, a
verdict of guilty under section 285(6)  could not have stood even if the jury
had made it. I think that in effect the learned trial judge charged the jury
that they could, and indeed should, find the accused guilty if, in their view
of the evidence, his conduct was such as to amount to what is commonly called
civil negligence. I think that this was clearly wrong. The learned trial judge
appears to have adopted a passage from one of the judgments delivered in McCarthy
v. The King 10, without giving effect to the
explanation of that judgment contained in The King v. Baker 11.
In my view this is entirely a matter of law and this ground is I think stated
in the dissenting judgment of Barclay J.

It is argued for the Respondent that this ground is not open
for our consideration. It is said that it was not taken in the notice of appeal
to the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) and is not a ground of dissent. It
is true

[Page 263]

that the defect in the charge referred to above was not made
a ground of appeal to the Court of Appeal but this seems to me, in this case,
to be unimportant. The conviction from which the appeal was taken was bad in
law as not being possible on the indictment. I do not think that the appellant
was required to set out other grounds or to anticipate that the Court of Appeal
would substitute a different verdict and to state reasons why that course
should not be followed. The appeal to this court is expressly stated to be
based on ""the grounds of law set forth in the dissenting judgment.""
While it may be proper that the notice of appeal should state with particularity
what those grounds are said to be, it is in the reasons for judgment given by
the dissenting judge rather than in the notice of appeal that our jurisdiction
must be found. The only question as to which there was disagreement in the
Court of Appeal was whether the verdict of guilty of criminal negligence having
been annulled, the Court of Appeal could or should substitute another verdict.
If and in so far as this decision turned on matters of fact or of mixed fact
and law we have no jurisdiction to review it, but if and in so far as it turned
on matters of law and if and in so far as such matters of law form part of the
grounds of dissent, we have jurisdiction. I read the reasons of the minority as
holding inter alia that section 1016(2)  cannot be applied because there
was such misdirection by the learned trial judge as to the kind of negligence
which must be found to exist to warrant a verdict of guilty of dangerous
driving under section 285(6)  that as a matter of law a verdict of dangerous
driving even if the jury had found it could not have stood.

It will be observed that at the commencement of his reasons
Barclay J. says ""In the view which I take of this case, it is not
necessary to consider the facts."" After holding that the jury could not on
the indictment legally find a verdict of criminal negligence, the learned judge
goes on to discuss the question whether a verdict of dangerous driving should
be substituted under section 1016(2) . He quotes the fatal misdirection referred
to above, adds other criticisms of the charge and continues: ""With all
these directions to the jury, I am of the opinion that speculation

[Page 264]

as to what they really intended would be most unfair to the
accused."" He then expresses a doubt, but does not decide, as to whether
section 1016(2)  applies unless the verdict proposed to be substituted is
included in the offence found by the jury; and concludes ""I consider
therefore that we have no right to substitute any other verdict.""

I do not think it is a forced construction of the reasons of
the learned judge to read them as indicating that one of the grounds which
moved him to hold that the Court of Appeal had no right to substitute a verdict
was the misdirection referred to above.

In The King v. Décary 12, in quashing an appeal on the ground that there
was no dissent on any question of law, the judgment of the court at page 84
reads as follows: ""Mr. Justice Walsh in the reasons delivered by him for
his conclusion that there should be a new trial, does not say, either expressly
or by implication, that this conclusion is based upon an opinion that the
majority proceeds upon any error in point of law alone.""

In my view, in the case at bar, Barclay J. does point out an
error in law, the misdirection referred to above, and does, I think expressly
but certainly if not expressly then by implication, base his judgment upon it,
I think the point is properly before us.

It has been suggested that it is a condition of this Court's
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal under section 1023(1)  of the Criminal
Code  that the dissenting judgment upon which such appeal is based shall
proceed upon a point of law with which the majority also deals and upon which
the majority and the dissenting judge or judges are in disagreement. I am
unable to accept this view. It is not, I think, disagreement between the judges
of the Court of Appeal on a point of law which gives jurisdiction. If that were
so there would be a right of appeal in a case in which one judge expressed
definite disagreement on a point of law dealt with by the other members of the
court but agreed with them that the appeal should be dismissed. In my opinion
the existence of the following two conditions is sufficient to give this court
jurisdiction: (i) that there be a dissenting judgment in the

[Page 265]

Court of Appeal, that is a judgment
differing from the result proposed by the majority and (ii) that a ground upon
which such dissenting judgment is based be a question of law.

I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction but under
all the circumstances of the case I think that the proper course is not to
direct a verdict of acquittal to be entered but to direct a new trial on the
charge of a breach of section 285(6)  of the Criminal Code .

Appeal dismissed.

Reporter’s Note—The appeal was argued on June 4, 1951 before Kerwin, Kellock,
Estey, Locke and Fauteux JJ. By order of the Court it was re-argued before the
full bench on Oct. 2.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Theft—Receiving—Retaining—Recent
Possession—Whether where explanation rejected but accused acquitted of
receiving conviction on retaining charge maintainable—Whether doctrine of
recent possession applies to retaining—Cr. Code s. 399.

The accused was charged with (a)
receiving and (b) retaining stolen goods knowing them to
be stolen. The evidence established that the goods were found in the recent
possession of the accused. He gave no evidence but his wife, called as a
witness on his behalf, gave an explanation as to how the goods came into her
husband’s possession. The trial judge, sitting without a jury, found that the
explanation was not a reasonable one but acquitted the accused on the receiving
charge and convicted him on the charge of retaining. An appeal to the Ontario
Court of Appeal was dismissed but leave to appeal to this Court was granted on
the following questions of law: (a) The doctrine of recent possession
does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods; (b) The learned
trial judge having acquitted the accused

[Page 171]

on a charge of receiving could not in the
circumstances of the case convict him on a charge of retaining; (c) An
accused person cannot be convicted of both of the offences of receiving and
retaining.

Held: Rinfret
C.J., Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ., (Kerwin, Taschereau and
Fauteux JJ. dissenting):

1. The appeal should be allowed.

2. An accused person cannot be convicted both
of receiving and of retaining. R. v. Yeaman 42 Can. C.C. 78; R. v. Searle 51
Can. C.C. 128; Frozocas v.
The King 60 Can. C.C.
324; Ecrement v. The King 84 Can. C.C. 349.

3. The accused having been acquitted on a
charge of receiving, could not in the circumstances of the case be convicted of
retaining.

Per Rand, Kellock,
Locke and Cartwright JJ. The accused having been acquitted on the receiving
charge it was for the Crown to establish subsequent guilty knowledge which it
failed to do. There was accordingly no evidence or no sufficient evidence upon
which a charge of retaining could be supported.

Per Kerwin J. contra.
The rejection of the explanation permits the doctrine of recent possession
to apply to the charge of retaining. Not only was there evidence to determine
that the explanation was not reasonable but it appeared that was the only
proper conclusion.

Per Taschereau
and Fauteux JJ. contra. In acquitting the accused on the charge of
receiving the trial judge said he did not accept the explanation and therefore
the presumption was not rebutted and it was open to him to decide as he did.

Held: also,
Rinfret C.J. Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Fauteux JJ., (Rand, Kellock, Locke
and Cartwright JJ. dissenting). The doctrine of recent possession applies to a
charge of retaining. The King v. Lum Man Bo 16 Can. C.C. 274; Lopatinsky v. The King [1948] S.C.R. 220.

Per Taschereau
and Fauteux JJ. S. 399 provides for two distinct offences “receiving” or
“retaining” knowing it to have been so obtained. It matters not then since
when on a charge of retaining, or how long after on a charge of
receiving, the guilty knowledge co-exists with possession, provided it does at
any time during retention on the former, and at the time of reception on the
latter. To import into the section any question as to the duration of the
guilty knowledge is to add to the word “knowing”, the most essential word in
the entire section, a qualification expressly rejected from the provision by
the very word itself.

Per Estey J.
The language adopted by Parliament indicates it contemplated the application of
the doctrine to the offence of retaining, and this view finds support in that
Parliament has not since Lum Man Bo supra was decided in 1910, enacted
any amendment to the section.

Per Rand,
Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ. contra. The doctrine does not apply,
the Crown must establish not only possession but knowledge subsequently
acquired of the stolen character of the goods. R. v. Cohen 8 Cox
C.C. 41 and R. v. Sleep 1 Le. & Ca. 44, applied. The King v.
Lum Man Bow supra, Richler v. The King [1939] S.C.R. 101 and Lopatinsky
v. The King, supra, distinguished.

[Page 172]

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming his
conviction by Forsyth County Court Judge in the County Court Judges’ Criminal
Court for the County of York on a charge of retaining stolen goods in his possession. Reversed.

C.L. Dubin K.C. for the appellant. The doctrine of recent possession does not apply to a charge of
retaining. The theory upon which the doctrine evolved was that a person who was
in possession of goods recently stolen was likely to be the thief and he was
called upon for an explanation as to the manner in which they came into his
possession. It had been the law that the so-called presumptive inference from
which a jury might convict related only to theft and not receiving. R. v.
Langmeand[2]
apparently for the first time extended that charge to receiving because
receiving also contemplates a guilty knowledge at the time of receipt.
Receiving recently stolen goods brings into question only the initial
possession of the goods whereas on a charge of retaining the initial possession
is presumed to be innocent and a person is guilty of retaining as distinguished
from receiving when having come by the goods honestly he later acquires knowledge
that they are stolen and keeps them. On such a charge an accused is not called
on to explain his initial possession because it is presumed innocent and the
entire doctrine of recent possession only calls upon the accused to explain his
initial possession. R. v. Searle[3];
R. v. Jones[4]; R.
v. Carmichael[5]; R.
v. Powell[6]; R.
v. Lamoureux[7]; R.
v. Scott[8]; R. v.
Watson[9].

The judgment in R. v. Lum Man Bow[10] to the contrary was wrongfully decided and
it will be noted that the argument now submitted was not made in that case, The
contrary view in Richler v. The King[11] is obiter and the Court was not
dealing with the argument now submitted.

In the alternative, assuming that the doctrine
of recent possession applies to a charge of retaining, the learned trial judge
having acquitted the accused of receiving could not

[Page 173]

properly in the circumstances have convicted him
of retaining and the verdict is inconsistent. Assuming the doctrine did apply
all that is thereby required was an explanation that might be reasonably true
that the accused came by the goods honestly. Roach J.A. in the Court of Appeal
held that the doctrine only required an explanation of how the accused came by
the goods and that an explanation which rebuts the presumption on the receiving
charge also rebuts it on the retaining charge and in the absence of other
evidence establishing guilty knowledge at the time of receiving he is entitled
to an acquittal. By an acquittal on the charge of receiving the accused has
rebutted the presumption of guilty knowledge at the time he initially came into
possession of the goods and any adverse inference from recent possession of
stolen goods has been met. The Court of Appeal failed to give any effect
whatever to the acquittal on the charge of receiving. Having been acquitted of
receiving the accused is in the same position as if his explanation had been
accepted and he could not properly be convicted unless there was evidence that
after his initial possession of the goods he subsequently learned they were
stolen. There is no such evidence. Neither the trial judge nor the Court of
Appeal made any such finding and the conviction was made and affirmed solely on
the doctrine of recent possession. The conviction on the charge of retaining
was inconsistent with the acquittal on the receiving charge. R. v. Cook[12]; R. v. Mondt[13]; R. v. Hayes and Pallante[14]; R. v. Christ[15].

The accused cannot be convicted of both the
offences of receiving and retaining. The Court of Appeal held that the accused
should have been convicted of receiving but having been acquitted on the
receiving charge all the evidence could be considered on a retaining charge as
if there had been no acquittal on the charge of receiving, and that the accused
could be convicted of both offences, but the offences are alternative offences
and an accused cannot be guilty of both. Where the accused has knowledge of the
goods being stolen at the time of their reception, he is guilty of receiving
and that offence is complete. If he continues to hold them he is still only guilty
of receiving. It is only where he realizes some time after he initially
received

[Page 174]

them that the goods are stolen and then retains
them that he is guilty of retaining. R. v. Brown[16]; R. v. Yeamen[17]; R. v. McClennan[18]; Ecrement v. The King[19]; R. v. Ungaro[20].

C.P. Hope K.C. for the respondent. “Receiving” and “retaining” in s. 399 relate to two different
offences. R. v. Searle[21]. This
statement of the law applies here as the appellant was acquitted of “receiving”
and convicted of “retaining”. The appellant contends the doctrine of recent
possession does not apply to a charge of retaining. It has long been held that
it applies to the offence of receiving. R. v. Langmead[22]. The Court of Appeal of British Columbia
held that it applied to the offence of retaining. R. v. Lum Man Bow[23] and R. v. Davis[24]. The latter case proceeded on the basis
that the Crown must prove that the goods were in fact stolen. In R. v. Parker[25] McDonald J.A. at p. 12 says that in cases
of receiving and retaining the question is not whether the explanation is
believed but whether it is a reasonable one. O’Halloran J.A. in R. v. Mandzuk[26] at 290 “Lack of proof that the appellant
knew the nature of the property and that it was stolen, fail to take into
consideration that when a person is found in possession of recently stolen
goods (in this case slightly under two months) that fact may be regarded as
circumstantial evidence of his knowledge (and cf. R. v. Wilson[27] Martin J.A. at 67) that they were stolen,
unless he gives a reasonable explanation of his possession of them.” Bird J.A.
at 295 “There being evidence of recent possession of stolen goods, a prima
facie presumption arises that the accused is either the thief or the
retainer of the stolen property.” In R. v. Tuck[28] the accused convicted of retaining
appealed, one ground being misdirection as to recent possession. Roach J.A. who
wrote the judgment of the Court says at p. 52 “The proper direction on the
trial of an accused charged with receiving or retaining has been settled, if
there was previously any doubt about it by the Supreme Court of Canada in Richler
v. The King[29].”

[Page 175]

At 103 the learned Chief Justice, with whom the
other members of the Court agreed, said: “The question, therefore, to which it
was the duty of the learned trial judge to apply his mind was not whether the
explanation might be reasonably true, or to put it in other words, whether the
Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the learned trial judge beyond a
reasonable doubt that the explanation of the accused could not be accepted as a
reasonable one and that he was guilty”, and at p. 54 “It is true that the
learned trial judge in those parts of his charge which I have quoted refers to
the doctrine of recent possession in cases where the charge is receiving. But since
the doctrine of recent possession applies similarly to a charge of retaining
there was no misdirection…” In R. v. Lopatinsky[30] Estey J., who wrote the judgment of the
Court, applies the doctrine to the offence of retaining.

As to the appellant’s second point that the
trial judge having acquitted on the receiving charge could not convict on the
retaining charge. He was entitled to convict on both or either of them
according to the way in which he viewed the evidence. R. v. Langmead
supra per Pollock C.B. at 467, Martin B. at 468. In the instant case it was
just as logical to convict of the retaining on an acquittal of receiving as it
was in the Langmead case to acquit of theft and convict of receiving. It
is for the jury to decide what is the proper verdict having regard to the
facts. R. v. Lincoln[31].
The reasoning of Roach J.A. who wrote the judgment of the Court of Appeal[32] is the correct reasoning, that of Martin
J.A. in R. v. Brown[33]
appears to be based on fallacious reasoning.

As to the appellant’s third point that an
accused person can not be convicted of both the offences of receiving and
retaining, the point is irrelevant as the appellant was convicted only of
retaining.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE: Leave to appeal was granted
on the following questions of law:

(a) The doctrine of recent possession
does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods;

[Page 176]

(b) The learned trial judge having
acquitted the accused on a charge of receiving could not in the circumstances
of the case convict him on a charge of retaining;

(c) An accused person cannot be convicted
of both offences of receiving and retaining.

In my humble view, the answer to Question (b)
is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.

There is no doubt that the weapons were stolen
goods; that the accused received them and that he had acquired recent
possession of them. The only other element necessary to be proved in order to
justify conviction on the charge of receiving was that the accused, at the time
he received them, knew they were so stolen.

To establish that necessary element “the Crown
relied on the doctrine of recent possession by the application of which the
burden rested on the accused to give an explanation that he came by these
weapons innocently”, which explanation might reasonably be true, and, because
it might reasonable be true, would raise a doubt as to his guilt.

Such explanation was given by the wife of the
accused. The trial judge analyzed that explanation, examined every fact or
element of same and came to the conclusion that it was not reasonable; but,
when he came to apply that conclusion to the charge of receiving, he
nevertheless acquitted the accused of that charge. On the same explanation,
which he did not believe, he found the accused guilty of retaining.

As the only ground upon which he could acquit
the accused of receiving was the explanation given by the wife, one must come
to the conclusion that he believed it and found it reasonable with regard to
the charge of receiving; while he stated in his judgment that he did not
believe it with regard to the charge of retaining.

In my opinion that is incompatible. He could not
at the same time believe the explanation or find it reasonable and disbelieve
it and find it unreasonable.

All the facts considered by him with regard to
that explanation, which led him to state that he thought the latter
unreasonable, were all facts having to do with the charge of receiving. None
were fresh facts which happened

[Page 177]

subsequent to the receiving and relating only to
the charge of retaining. That is precisely the interpretation of Roach J.A.,
who delivered the reasons for the Court of Appeal:[34]. “The trial judge held that the
explanation was not reasonable but he nevertheless acquitted him”. There was
only one explanation given and it applied to the charge of receiving. There was
no distinct explanation given as regard to the charge of retaining.

There were no new facts put in evidence whereby
a distinction could be made between the receiving and the retaining.

Very respectfully I think that the trial judge
having acquitted the accused on the charge of receiving could not, in the
circumstances of the case, convict him on a charge of retaining.

In my view, there is an absolute contradiction
between the two findings of the trial judge.

For that reason, I am of opinion that the appeal
should be allowed and the conviction set aside.

However, I understand that the reason for
submitting de novo the appeal to the full Court was mainly to have the
Court pronounce upon the question whether the doctrine of recent possession
does or does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods; and on that
additional point I wish to state that I concur with the other members of the
Court who express the opinion that the doctrine does apply equally to a charge
of retaining as to a charge of receiving stolen goods.

KERWIN J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal, by
leave granted under section 1025  of the Criminal Code  as enacted by
s. 42  of c. 39 of the Statutes of 1948. The appellant was convicted in the
County Court Judge’s Criminal Court of the County of York, on June 7, 1950, of
retaining in his possession, in the months of January and February, 1950, a
Remington repeating shot gun and a Remington repeating rifle, the property of
Grayson D. Burruss and therefore stolen, knowing the same to have been so
stolen. This charge was the fourth count in a charge sheet which charged the
appellant, first, with breaking and entering by day in

[Page 178]

January, 1950, the dwelling house of Grayson D.
Burruss and stealing three guns and other articles, second, with breaking and
entering by night in January, 1950, the same dwelling house with intent to
commit theft, third, with receiving in his possession in the months of January
and February the shot gun and rifle theretofore stolen, knowing the same to
have been so stolen.

It was proved that on January 16, 1950, the gun
and rifle were stolen from Mr. Burruss’ house. The gun was found in the
possession of the accused in his house on February 25, 1950. The rifle had on some
earlier date in February been handed by the accused to one Enge for sale by the
latter on terms that it would be sold for at least twenty dollars and that
anything over that could be kept by Enge. There is no question about the
identity of the gun and rifle and of the fact of their having been stolen. The
accused did not give evidence but an explanation as to how these two articles
came into his possession was given by his wife, which to some extent was
corroborated by the testimony of Enge who had been called on behalf of the Crown.
The County Court Judge found the explanation not reasonable and he found the
appellant guilty on the fourth count, that is, of retaining, but endorsed the
charge sheet with a verdict of not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 3.

Under these circumstances the first point argued
was that the doctrine of recent possession does not apply to a charge of
retaining. The applicable provision of the Criminal Code  is s. 399 ,
which reads as follows:

399. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to fourteen years’ imprisonment, who receives or retains in
his possession anything obtained by any offence punishable on indictment, or by
any acts wheresoever committed, which, if committed in Canada would have
constituted an offence punishable upon indictment, knowing such thing to have
been so obtained.

The offence of retaining was unkown to the
common or statute law of England but was introduced in Canada when the Criminal Code  was first enacted in 1892. It is an
entirely separate offence from receiving. The doctrine of recent possession, as
to both theft and receiving, was clearly established in Reg. v. Langmead[35]. There, Langmead had been indicted and
tried for stealing sheep, and

[Page 179]

on a second count, for receiving the sheep
knowing them to have been stolen. The jury convicted him on the latter count.
It was argued that upon an indictment for receiving stolen goods, there should
be some evidence to show that the goods were in fact stolen by some other
person, and that recent possession of the stolen property was not alone
sufficient to support such an indictment as such possession was evidence of
stealing and not of receiving. That argument was not accepted. Chief Baron
Pollock pointed out that the distinction between the presumption as to
felonious receiving and stealing is not a matter of law. Blackburn J. stated
that as a proposition of law, there was no presumption that recent possession
points more to stealing than receiving. He continued:

If a party is in possession of stolen
property recently after the stealing, it lies on him to account for his
possession, and if he fails to account for it satisfactorily, he is reasonably
presumed to have come by it dishonestly; but it depends on the surrounding
circumstances whether he is guilty of receiving or stealing. Whenever the
circumstances are such as render it more likely that he did not steal the
property, the presumption is that he received it.

Of course, he was concerned only with the
charges of stealing and receiving as there was no such offence as retaining
known to the law at that time.

Logically there is as much reason to apply the
doctrine to a charge of retaining as to a charge of receiving. It was so held
by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in The King v. Lum Man Bow[36], and by this Court in Lopatinsky v.
The King[37]. The
point may not have been raised in those cases in the same manner as it was
presented on this appeal but it was distinctly mentioned in the factum for the
Crown, filed in this Court in the Lopatinsky appeal. I agree with the view of
Roach J.A. in the Court of Appeal[38] in the
present case where he states:

Where the charge is retaining the
explanation relates to the period of retention in this way and to this extent,
that if at the time the accused received the goods he had knowledge that they
were stolen, he continued

[Page 180]

thereafter to have that knowledge, but if
at the time he received them he had not that guilty knowledge, there is no
presumption that he thereafter acquired it. There is no burden on the accused
who is charged with the offence of retaining to do more than give an
explanation which might reasonably be true that at the time of receiving the
goods he had not the guilty knowledge that they were stolen. Indeed, it is not
difficult to think of a case in which a party innocently obtained possession of
stolen goods and, apart from giving an explanation of the circumstances in
which those goods came into his possession, he could do no more.

From the foregoing it follows that if an
accused stands charged with both receiving and retaining stolen goods an
explanation which rebuts the presumption on the receiving charge also rebuts it
on the retaining charge and in the absence of other evidence establishing
guilty knowledge at the time of receiving, he is entitled to an acquittal on
that charge and in the absence of evidence establishing that after having
received them he acquired knowledge that they were stolen, he is entitled to an
acquittal on the retaining charge.

The second point raised by the appellant is that
the trial judge having acquitted the accused of the charge of receiving could
not, in the circumstances, convict him of retaining. However, it is not as if
the trial judge had stated that he had accepted the explanation offered on
behalf of the accused and therefore dismissed the charge of receiving, in which
case it might be argued that there was nothing upon which he could base the
conviction for retaining. In the circumstances existing in the present case,
the fact that for some unexplained reason the appellant was found not guilty of
receiving does not prevent a verdict of guilty of retaining. The rejection of
the explanation permits the doctrine of recent possession to apply to the
charge of retaining. It should be added that not only is there evidence upon which
the trial judge could determine that the explanation was not reasonable but it
appears that was the only proper conclusion.

The third point raised, that an accused person
cannot be convicted of both offences, receiving and retaining, does not arise
since the appellant was found not guilty of receiving.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 181]

The judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux, JJ. was
delivered by:

FAUTEUX J.:—It appears necessary, in view of the
arguments raised in this appeal, to deal, at first, with the true legal notion
of the offence or offences, created by the Canadian Parliament, in s. 399  of
the Criminal Code , and then, consider the evidence on record and the
conviction of retaining which is questioned by this appeal.

As to the first point.

By—and ever since—the enactment of the Criminal
Code  of Canada, retaining, as well as receiving, goods obtained by theft,
knowing them to have been so obtained, constitutes a criminal offence in
Canada. In this respect and since 1892, the Canadian law is at variance with
the English law, wherein only the act of receiving, and not the act of
retaining, constitutes an offence.

One of the consequences of this change and this
difference in the two laws is that the cases decided in England,—where the
occasion to discuss and apply a provision similarly worded as s. 399  never
arose,—do not and cannot offer a precise and exhaustive definition of receiving
and of retaining, both standing in relation to one another, as they do in s.
399 .

But an important feature of the change, with
respect to the real import of the section, stems from the very process by which
it was accomplished. For this change in the law was not achieved by amendment,
but by a codification of what became the main body of the Canadian Criminal
Law, a law flowing from sources different in nature and origin. This very fact
brings to the fore the rule of interpretation related to codification,
according to which resort must not be had to the law pre-existing the codified
law, unless the provisions of the latter be obscure and ambiguous.

Thus, to gather the true legal notion of the
provisions of s. 399 , the “proper course”—in the very words of Lord Halsbury,
L.C., in Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers[39], at page 151:

* * * is in the first instance to examine
the language of the statute and to ask what is its natural meaning,
uninfluenced by any considerations derived from the previous state of the law, and
not to start with inquiring

[Page 182]

how the law previously stood, and then,
assuming that it was probably intended to leave it unaltered, to see if the
words of the enactment will bear an interpretation in conformity with this
view.

But whether or not this rule is applied—and I
can think of no reasons why it should not in the case under consideration—I
fail to see what the difficulty is with respect to the first point, i.e., what
facts may constitute an offence under the provisions of the section.

In the very terms of the provision under our
law, everyone commits an indictable offence who:

(a) “RECEIVES or RETAINS in his
possession * * *”

(b) “* * * anything obtained by any
offence punishable on indictment, or by any acts wheresoever committed, which,
if committed in Canada, would have constituted an offence punishable upon
indictment

(c) “* * * KNOWING such thing to have
been so obtained.”

The natural meaning of this language is clear
and non-ambiguous.

In (a):—If the evidence indicates the
reception, on a charge of receiving, or the retention, on a charge of
retaining, the first element, respective to each case, is fully established.
This conclusion is equally true if, on either charge, both the reception and
the retention are shown in the evidence; for—as far as the evidence is
concerned—the question in each case, is not related to superabundance but only
to sufficiency of the proof. Indeed, and in fact, less frequent may be the
cases—but there are—where the one who receives does not retain, at least for
some measurable time. The case of Milton v. The King[40] is a case in point. Equally, accidental
may be the cases where a person who retains dishonestly, has received honestly,
even though he had throughout the knowledge that the goods were stolen. This is
illustrated by the case of Rex v. Matthews[41]. Again and by the mere operation of s. 69
or others, one may in law, if not in fact, retain without having first
received.

[Page 183]

The difficulty there may be in certain
cases,—where, as an illustration, the reception and the retention amount to one
single transaction—to determine when the reception ceases and when the
retention begins, is one related to evidence and not to substantive law.

In my view, this element in (a), while
being worded in all-embracing, but not obscure nor confusing terms, is clear
evidence of the will of the Canadian Parliament to cover in the most complete
and effective manner the case of possession, at both reception and retention
time.

In (b):—No discussion arises in this
case.

In (c):—The third element which, as the
second, is common to receiving and retaining, is the guilty knowledge. The
words in the enactment are “knowing such thing to have been so
obtained”. The guilty knowledge must then co-exist with possession,—and this
statutory requirement is fully satisfied if it does—(1) at the time of
reception, on a charge of receiving, or (2) at any time during the period of
retention, on a charge of retaining. In this respect, receiving and retaining
are distinguishable as criminal offences. And once an accused is proved to have
received or retained anything, obtained in any of the manners indicated in (b),
the question is:—Did he, (1) at the time of receiving or (2) at any time
during the period of retaining, or (3) throughout the whole period of his
possession, have the knowledge that the thing was so illegally obtained?

An affirmative answer to (1), or (2), or (3)
undoubtedly establishes clear guilt and certainly makes the accused amenable to
justice, for receiving in (1), for retaining in (2), or either of them in (3);
for in each case, the elements of guilt, as enacted by Parliament, are present.

Indeed and in the third alternative, guilty
knowledge co-exists with both the reception and the retention of the
possession. The fact that the evidence on a charge of retaining would indicate
that the guilty knowledge proven to exist during the retention, would have
equally preexisted to it, or the fact that the evidence on a charge of
receiving would indicate that the guilty knowledge, proven to exist at the time
of reception, would not have ceased to exist but continued thereafter, cannot
alter but only strengthen, in each case, the proof of the co‑existence of

[Page 184]

the guilty knowledge with possession. For the
enactment merely says “knowing the same to have been so obtained”. No
matter then, since when, on a charge of retaining, or how long after,
on a charge of receiving, does the guilty knowledge co-exist with
possession, provided it does at any time during retention, on the former, or at
the time of reception, on the latter. To import in the section any like
questions as to the duration of the knowledge is, in my view, adding to the
word “knowing”—the most essential word in the entire section—a qualification
expressly rejected from the provision by the very word itself.

In brief, the section provides, as it was
decided in several Canadian cases, for two distinct offences, the first being
receiving and then the second being retaining anything illegally obtained, knowing
it to have been so obtained.

With respect to punishment, the inescapable
consequence of the distinction between the two offences is that the sentence
stated in the section is the authorized punishment for the commission of
either of the two offences therein created.

It is from the latter conclusion—which is not
disputed—that stem the following argument and conclusion made on behalf of the
appellant.

It is said that Parliament never intended that,
in addition to a penalty for receiving, the accused should be liable to a
further penalty if, after so acquiring stolen goods, he retains them. On the
basis, and as a result of this assumption, another and a new concept of the
offence of retaining is advanced and concluded to be the one meant by the
language of the section. It is suggested that retaining stolen goods, knowing
them to have been stolen, ceases to be the offence of retaining once the
evidence, establishing a guilty knowledge during retention, also indicates that
this guilty knowledge was gained at the time of reception of the stolen goods
or, to put it with more precision, that the guilty knowledge in retaining must
be—and, therefore, must be proved to be—not only subsequent to reception but
exclusively so.

One would observe, at first, that this concept
of retaining—in support of which no precedent has been found to exist—rests on
the limited consideration of a case where receiving and retaining amount to a
continuous or a single transaction.

[Page 185]

It would nevertheless, if accepted, affect the
infinite variety of cases where retaining or receiving may, in fact and in law,
not amount to a continuous or single transaction. This, particularly in view of
the clear language of the section, calls for the necessity of examining both
the assumption and the conclusion advanced on behalf of the appellant.

As to the first.

Whether or not Parliament intended, in the
particular case above stated, that an accused should be liable to two
penalties, is a matter that we are not called upon to decide in this case. In
all the reported cases where the occasion to decide the question could have
arisen, one penalty only was given, or if two were stated, they were made
concurrent. I fail nonetheless to appreciate how a negative answer to the
question could afford a valid criterion for the interpretation of the section.
For the fact that a man may not be punished twice for the same offence
does not necessarily import that he may not twice be prosecuted on a
different charge setting up another legal aspect of the same facts. S. 15  of
the Criminal Code  supports that proposition.

As to the conclusion of the new definition.

With deference, I am unable to agree with the
view that while, admittedly, the offence of retaining must, as one of its
elements, include the guilty knowledge at some time while the possession is
being retained, it must also exclude it at the time when possession is gained.
I can think of no case where Parliament states—except in express language—the
elements of a crime in maximum or exclusive terms and where, as a consequence,
evidence must be made to exclude certain facts in order to reach the degree of
certainty required for a conviction in criminal matters. Receiving and
retaining, in s. 399 , are certainly not described in such a manner. Strange and
most technical, I think, it would be (a) if a person accused of
retaining, could, having admitted the existence of the guilty knowledge during
the retention, plead successfully that this knowledge had been already gained
by him at the very time the goods were received; or, conversely, (b) if
a person, accused of receiving, could plead successfully on that charge, that
the guilty knowledge existing, at the time he gained possession, continued
thereafter with the retention of the possession.

[Page 186]

Under the authorities where possession is proved
to be recent in relation to theft, a presumption arises that the possessor came
by the goods dishonestly. If, consequently, the above definition of retaining
is accepted, this presumption of fact could, by itself, defeat the case of the
prosecution on a charge of retaining, where the evidence indicates recent
possession.

That the evidence, in some cases, may, on either
charge, indicate the elements of both crimes is certain, but, if it does, I can
find no justification to say that one of either the charge of receiving or the
charge of retaining should have been preferred, by preference to the other.

For these reasons, I am not only unable to
conclude that the above contention, made on behalf of the appellant, casts any
obscurity or ambiguity on the natural meaning of the provision, but I am
convinced that, if accepted, it would directly defeat the only import of the
word knowing.

Dealing now with the second point, i.e., the
evidence on record with respect to the conviction of retaining in the present
appeal.

In the present case, the evidence revealed
particularly the following facts: On the 16th of January 1950, the residence of
one Burruss was broken into and entered; certain chattels, including a
Remington repeating shot-gun and a Remington repeating rifle were stolen
therefrom; having gained possession of these weapons, the appellant gave the rifle—valued
at sixty-eight dollars—to an immediate neighbour, one Enge, with instructions
to sell it, at a price left at the latter’s discretion, provided that out of
the proceeds of the sale, twenty dollars would be remitted to the appellant;
the other gun was still in the possession of the latter, on the 25th of
February 1950, when it was seized in execution of a search warrant.

Thus the appellant—even on the theory of a
defence—did, as a fact, receive and retain possession of stolen goods. Of this
there is no dispute.

The only point in issue is related to the third
element, i.e., the guilty knowledge of the appellant.

One cannot in fact—even if he may in law—retain
possession of a thing without having first gained possession of the same. Thus,
on a charge of retaining, in order to decide whether the retaining is honest or
dishonest, it

[Page 187]

becomes not only pertinent and material but
essential to consider whether there is any admissible evidence in the case
indicating that the accused had or had not the guilty knowledge when he gained
possession.

For once the character of this original
possession is, in a given case, ascertained by direct or circumstantial
evidence, as being dishonest or not proved to be such, the character of this
original possession cannot suddenly change without further evidence of some
subsequent intervening fact altering it. Thus, and in the absence of any such
subsequent fact, if the knowledge is shown by the evidence to be dishonest at
the time when possession is gained, no presumption arises that it becomes
honest during retention; and conversely, if the knowledge is proved to be
honest—or not proved to be dishonest—at the time the accused gained possession,
no presumption can either arise, without such subsequent fact, that this
knowledge at the time possession was gained became dishonest during the period
possession was retained.

Knowledge is a matter of fact and the proof of
its character is not dependent on the nature of the charge laid but on the very
nature of the facts disclosed in the evidence.

Amongst the methods of proving the guilty
knowledge, the doctrine of recent possession must be considered. Thus, any
person, found in possession of stolen goods, is presumed to have come by them
dishonestly if such possession is recent in relation to the theft; or, as was
said by the Lord Chief Justice in Rex v. Powell[42], at page 2:—

The possession of recently stolen property
throws on the possessor the onus of shewing that he got it honestly.

The presumption being applied in the case of an
indictment with a count of theft and a count of receiving, the jurisprudence is
that in the absence of any explanation which might reasonably be true, the
accused may—but must not necessarily—be found guilty of either theft or
receiving. But the presumption itself is one of fact and not one of law. Again,
it is not dependent on the charge laid, but it rests solely on the fact that
the possession of the stolen goods is recent in relation to the theft thereof.
The guilty knowledge is then presumed.

[Page 188]

The fact that there are no authorities in
England indicating that the presumption arising from recent possession would
apply to what is a case of retaining under the Canadian law, is of no
significance in the present discussion but is only consistent with the other
fact that the offence of retaining as we have it under the Code, is not
known in England.

That the complete doctrine of recent possession
has been applied in Canada on a charge of retaining, is clearly evidenced by
the following decisions: The Supreme Court of Canada in Lopatinsky[43]; The Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v.
Tuck[44]; The
British Columbia Court of Appeal in The King v. Lum Man Bow[45]. And in no reported cases, anywhere in
Canada, was it said that the presumption is inapplicable on a charge of
retaining.

In the present case, it is granted that the
possession by the appellant of the stolen guns was recent in relation to the
theft thereof. Thus, this sole fact, conditioning the play of the presumption,
being established, the appellant is therefore presumed to have come by these
guns dishonestly. This is a rule of evidence and not of substantive law.

Further, there is nothing in the evidence
indicating that this original guilty knowledge was subsequently changed to
become honest during the period of time covered by the count of retaining, in
the charge sheet.

The accused was jointly tried on four counts,
the third being for receiving and the fourth for retaining. At no time did he
ask for a separate trial on each or any of these counts. And, in the evidence
common to all counts and admissible in each, appears an explanation, not only
as to how the appellant gained possession of the stolen guns but how he dealt
with each of them thereafter. This explanation was not accepted by the trial judge,
and was qualified as “preposterous” by all the members of the Court of Appeal.
In the views of both Courts, the presumption that the accused came by these
guns dishonestly had not been rebutted. It was open, therefore, to the trial
judge to decide, as he did, that the guilty knowledge existing at the time the
appellant gained possession of these guns continued while he retained them, for
there was no evidence

[Page 189]

of any subsequent fact affecting the dishonest
character of the original possession. On the contrary, the facts subsequent to
the time the accused gained possession of the guns, added to the presumption,
resulting from the recent possession, that he came by them dishonestly, were
only capable of strengthening this guilty knowledge during the time of
retention. Thus, (a) the appellant sold one of the two guns which the
alleged unknown hunters were supposed to claim back, (b) the sale was
made at a ridiculous price left, besides, to the discretion of a neighbour to
whom the gun was entrusted; (c) these alleged hunters unknown to the
appellant were never heard of though two months had elapsed when the seizure of
the last gun took place.

It is true that the learned trial judge
acquitted the appellant on the charge of receiving—one is not bound to convict
on the strength of the presumption alone, the rule is “may” but not “must” find
guilt,—and found him guilty on the charge of retaining. This leads the
appellant to argue that, there being no other evidence as to the guilty
knowledge but the presumption arising from recent possession, the acquittal on
receiving was evidence that the trial judge accepted the explanation of the
defence as to recent possession.

No doubt that, having been acquitted of
receiving, the appellant could, on a fresh indictment for the same offence,
plead autrefois acquit. But to say that, on the basis of this acquittal
on receiving, one must conclude that on the consideration of the charge of
retaining, the trial judge accepted the explanation of the appellant when, in
too concise oral reasons for judgment but yet in unmistakable terms, he
effectively said he did not, does not follow. It may be that, had the verdict
been given by a jury or had the trial judge given no reasons, the appellant
could have invoked the decision rendered in the Quinn case[46], a decision resting on what is still a
conflicting view of the law in Canada. See Rex v. Bayn[47]; L. v. The King[48]. But again, and in the present instance,
the trial judge plainly said he did not accept the explanation. The presumption
was not rebutted and it was open to the trial judge to decide as he did.

[Page 190]

In support of the appellant’s contention on this
last point, the case of Leonard Edward Ernest Christ[49], was quoted. In my view, this case is not
only distinguishable from the present one, but is rather conclusive against the
theory advanced on behalf of the appellant. The ratio decidendi in that
appeal is to be found behind the verdict. It rests on a consideration of the
evidence made in the light of the summing up. It is expressed in these terms by
Devlin J.: “It is impossible to believe that the jury could have accepted the
evidence of the police, upon which alone they would be justified in convicting
him of receiving, and that at the same time rejected it, or not accepted it, in
the case of larceny.” In that case, there was no alternative. The police could
not, at the same time, be believed and disbelieved.

On the contrary, there is an alternative open to
a judge or a jury when the presumption of guilt, arising from recent
possession, is actually found to be unrebutted. Upon such unrebutted
presumption, there may, or may not, be a verdict of guilty. Again, the doctrine
is not that the judge “must” but that he “may” convict upon it. The essential
point in the present appeal is that there is no place for speculation as to
what the finding of fact of the trial judge was in this respect for he clearly
stated he did not accept the explanation. This was a finding of fact and even
if it may be stated that his conclusion or the verdict he rendered on the
charge of receiving, did not follow from this finding of fact, this can hardly
supply a valid reason to adopt, on the consideration of the charge of
retaining, a conclusion which, again, would not follow from this particular
finding of fact further supplemented with evidence of circumstances subsequent
to the time of reception of the guns.

Furthermore, even on the basis of the
proposition propounded on behalf of the appellant,—a proposition which, with
deference, I do not accept—that in a case of retaining, the guilty knowledge
must be exclusively subsequent to receiving, the oral judgment of the trial
judge fully justifies the conclusion that on his view of the evidence, there
was no doubt that the appellant had the guilty knowledge during the period of
retention of the guns, even if he did not have it at the time he received them.

[Page 191]

While each case must be determined according to
its own factual and legal features, in the circumstances of the instant case I
agree with the conclusion reached in the unanimous judgment of the Ontario
Court of Appeal that the conviction on the count of retaining should stand.

The appeal, consequently, should be dismissed.

The judgment of Rand, Kellock, Locke and
Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:

KELLOCK J.:—The appellant was charged in the
County Court Judge’s Criminal Court with (a) breaking and entering by
day the dwelling house of one Grayson D. Burruss and the theft therefrom of
certain guns and other articles, (b) breaking and entering by night
the said dwelling house with intent to commit theft therein, (c)
receiving a shotgun and rifle, property of the said Burruss, knowing the same
to have been stolen, and (d) retaining in his possession the said
shotgun and rifle, knowing the same to have been stolen.

He was acquitted on the first three charges but
was convicted on the charge of retaining, his appeal with respect to this
charge being dismissed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The appellant now
appeals to this court, by leave, upon the following questions of law:

(a) The doctrine of recent
possession does not apply to a charge of retaining stolen goods.

(b) The learned trial judge, having
acquitted the accused on a charge of receiving, could not, in the circumstances
of the case, convict him on a charge of retaining.

(c) An accused person cannot be
convicted on both the offences of receiving and retaining.

The charge of receiving of which he was
acquitted was as follows:

That the said John Clay, at the Township of
North York and elsewhere within the County of York, in the months of January
and February in the year 1950, received in his possession a Remington repeating
shotgun and a Remington repeating rifle, the property of Grayson D. Burruss,
and therefore stolen, knowing the same to have been so stolen, contrary to the
Criminal Code .

[Page 192]

The charge which is the subject matter of this
appeal is

And further, that the said John Clay, at
the Township of North York and elsewhere within the County of York, in the
months of January and February in the year 1950, retained in his possession a
Remington repeating shotgun and a Remington repeating rifle, the property of
Grayson D. Burruss, and theretofore stolen, knowing the same to have been
stolen, contrary to the Criminal Code .

This last mentioned offence was for the first
time made an offence in Canada under that name in 1892 when the Criminal
Code  was first enacted by 55-56 Vict. c. 29, s. 314 (now s. 399 ). The
words, “or retains in his possession,” were not in the bill as originally
drafted, but were apparently added between second and third readings. The same
words were also placed in s. 315  (now s. 400 ) and in the early part of s. 316 
(now 401), but were omitted, perhaps by oversight, in the latter part of that
section.

As to the offence of receiving stolen property
with knowledge that it had been stolen, it was said by Avory J. in Rex v.
Norris[50], that
the offence of “receiving” is one of the most simple in the criminal law. “The
essence of the charge is that the defendant should be proved to have known at
the time” that the property had been stolen. The learned judge also
said that, “Generally, it is enough to say that it is not a crime merely to be
in possession of stolen property.” So much is this so, even with knowledge of
their stolen character, that in R. v. Tennet[51], the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a
conviction on the charge of receiving because the trial judge, in the course of
his summing up to the jury, had said that the Crown had to prove that the
accused knew the goods were stolen at the time he received them “or had them in
his possession.”

Knowledge, then, at the time the accused person
comes into possession of the goods is the essence of the charge of receiving,
and if the element of knowledge at that time be lacking, it will not do, in
order to support a charge of receiving, to show that the goods were kept after
guilty

[Page 193]

knowledge subsequently acquired; R. v. Johnson[52]. In fact, even though at the very time of
receipt the accused person knows that the goods are stolen, but then intends to
turn them over to the police, although he subsequently changes his mind, the
offence of “receiving” is not made out; R. v. Matthews[53].

As s. 402 provides, the act of receiving is
complete as soon as the offender has possession or control over the goods, or
aids in concealing or disposing of them. Merely because, however, the goods may
remain in the possession of the offender, does not render the offence any the
less that of receiving, the essence of the offence being, as already pointed
out, not length of possession but knowledge of the stolen character of the
goods at the time possession is acquired. It is of interest to observe in this
connection that the old form of indictment against a receiver, as set out in
Taschereau’s Criminal Acts (1888) p. 444, was

“that A.B.,… did receive and have…”

When, therefore, Parliament added the words,
“retains in his possession” anything obtained by any offence punishable on
indictment “knowing such thing to have been so obtained,” it could hardly have
intended to have constituted a new and additional offence to be made out by
mere continuance of possession for some “measurable interval of time” (to use
the language of Roach J.A. in the court below) after receipt, as this ground
was already covered by the offence of “receiving.” Parliament must have
intended to create an offence distinct from that of receiving, and as the
latter includes all cases in which guilty knowledge was acquired at the time of
the receipt of the goods, the offence of “retaining” can only arise where that
element is lacking but where knowledge of their stolen character is
subsequently acquired and the goods are kept thereafter. It has been so held in
R. v. Yeaman[54], a
decision of the

[Page 194]

British Columbia Court of Appeal; R. v. Searle[55], a decision of the Appellate Division of
the Supreme Court of Alberta; Frozocas v. The King[56], and Ecrement v. The King[57], both decisions of the Court of King’s
Bench, Appeal Side, of the Province of Quebec. I think the offence of retaining
is correctly described in R. v. Searle by Harvey C.J.A. at p.
128:

Section 399  makes one “who receives or
retains” guilty of an offence. One may receive stolen goods not knowing them to
be stolen and subsequently learning that they were stolen may retain them and
thereby become guilty of “retaining” though he could not be found guilty of
“receiving”.

These two different offences are very clearly
described by Walsh J. in the Frozocas case at p. 331, as follows:

It is true that an accused may be guilty of
receiving goods stolen; he may also innocently receive the stolen goods, and
become guilty of retaining them later, when he will have acquired knowledge of
their unlawful source. Section 399 , Cr. Code, was amended to cover the
latter offence.

In the case with which the court was there
concerned, it was contended that the conviction of the appellant was illegal
because it condemned him for having committed two distinct offences; first, for
having received the goods knowing them to have been stolen, and second, for having
retained them with the same knowledge. Notwithstanding the form of the
information and conviction, the evidence in the case was all directed to
establishing guilty knowledge at the time of the actual receipt of the goods.
With respect to the objection to the conviction, Walsh J. had this to say:

Though s. 399 speaks of receiving and
retaining, and though these may indicate at times separate offences, yet
there are also times, and the present case is to the point, when retaining is a
continuation of the act of receiving. In this instance, to have said that the
accused retained the goods in question was only surplusage.

[Page 195]

Howard J. put the point another way at p. 327,
referring to the judgment of Harvey C.J.A. in Searle’s case:

I concur in the opinion expressed by the
learned Chief Justice that s. 399 deals with two offences in a case such as he
describes, but I have serious doubt that, where an accused has received goods
which he knew at the time were stolen and retained them, an indictment to that
effect can be said to contain two distinct counts. I am rather disposed to the
opinion that in such circumstances, there is but one offence charged—that the
acts of receiving and retaining constitute “in substance one transaction,
one continuous set of transactions:” Weinbaum v. The King 53 Que.
KB. 270.

Letourneau J. at p. 329 dealt with the matter as
follows:

The appellant is right in alleging
irregularity in the indictment for having received, concealed and kept
stolen goods (Rex v. Searle, 51 Can. C.C. 128) in fine when s.
399 of the Cr. Code says, “who receives or retains in his possession…”
but then again it must be said that if we come to the conclusion that a crime
of having “received… knowing” etc., was committed, this plea in regard to a
defect in the form of the complaint, is without any bearing.

Tellier C.J. and Dorion J. concurred.

It is plain, therefore, that the difference
between these two offences is that, in the case of the offence of retaining,
there is an interval of time, however short, between the actual receipt of the
goods and receipt of knowledge of their stolen character, during which interval
the possession is either an honest possession or the character of this interval
is not in question. The answer to the third question of law raised on the
appeal is, therefore, that an accused person cannot be convicted of both the
offence of receiving and that of retaining the same goods. They are distinct
offences and mutually exclusive. No one would suggest, I think, that the thief
may be convicted of retaining merely because he keeps possession. I think a
similar contention as to the receiver is equally unsound.

With respect to the presumption arising from
possession of recently stolen goods, Pollock C.B., in his charge to the jury in
Regina v. Exall[58], put
the matter this way:

Property recently stolen, found in the
possession of a person, is always presumptive evidence against that person,
unless the possession can be accounted for and explained consistently with
innocence.

The question which arises is as to the offences
with respect to the commission of which, such possession is evidence,

[Page 196]

and that is answered by the learned Chief Baron
in the passage immediately following that above quoted, namely,

The principle is this, that if a person is
found in possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no
reasonable account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that
he committed the robbery.

And so it is of any crime to which the
robbery was incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson or
murder. For, if the possession be evidence that the person committed the
robbery, and the person who committed the robbery committed the other crime,
then it is evidence that the person in whose possession the property is
found committed that other crime.

Examples of the application of the presumption
in connection with the crimes mentioned are referred to in Taylor on Evidence,
12th Edition, p. 135, and Archbold, 32nd Edition, p, 404.

The offence of receiving is, of course,
“incident to” or “connected with” robbery, burglary or theft, as may be also
arson and murder, but that is not true of the offence of retaining stolen
goods, as the latter is separated from knowledge of the character of the goods
by reason of the interval of time already referred to. There is a complete
break between the commission of these other offences and that of retaining,
while in the case of receiving it is directly connected by reason of the guilty
knowledge existing from the moment when the possession of the accused
commences. In other words, recent possession implies association with the thief
in the particular case. Any such connection in respect of a charge of retaining
is, however, excluded by the elements of that offence.

The close connection between the offences of
theft and receiving is indicated in East’s Pleas of the Crown, Vol. 2, p. 744,
in the author’s discussion of earlier legislative attempts to deal with these
offences, where he says that the receiver was generally the employer and patron
of the thief. In fact, 29 Geo. II c. 30, s. 1, recites that “buyers or
receivers are the principal cause of the commission of such theft.” It may be
that this fact entered into the reason for the rule under discussion.

In Regina v. Langmead, which is
best reported in 1 Le. & Ca. 427, the defendant was indicted on two counts,
one for theft and the other for receiving, knowing the goods to

[Page 197]

have been stolen. Blackburn J. at 437 stated the
presumption which arises from the fact of possession, as follows:

I should have said that recent possession
was evidence either of stealing or receiving, according to circumstances, and
that, as soon as it was proved that the person in whose possession they were
found did not steal them, his possession, if unaccounted for, was evidence that
he had received them knowing them to be stolen.

While, as already stated, the offence of
retaining stolen goods does not exist in England, the following from the same
learned judge in the above case is pertinent with respect to the
inapplicability of the presumption to an offence such as retaining. Blackburn
J. said at p. 438:

If you start with the datum that the
prisoner was in possession of the sheep, then, his possession being dishonest,
he must have been the receiver, if he was not the thief. As soon as it was
shown that the prisoner could not have been the thief, it followed that he was
the receiver.

This renders the point, in my opinion, very
clear. In the case of theft and receiving, the possession of an accused can
only be a dishonest possession, the only question to be answered so far as
guilt is concerned being whether the accused actually stole the goods himself
or received them from another person knowing them to be stolen. But if the
character of the original receipt of the goods by the accused is not in
question, but he is charged only with having subsequently acquired guilty
knowledge, there is no room for the operation of the presumption with which the
court in Langmead’s case was concerned, and the Crown must establish
affirmatively that such knowledge was in fact acquired. Just as the offence of
retaining is itself the creation of statute, a statute would also be required
to raise a presumption of guilty knowledge acquired after a receipt the character
of which is not in question.

While, as already mentioned, there is no offence
in England of retaining stolen goods generally, there has been for a great many
years the offence of having possession of military or naval stores marked with
His Majesty’s mark. The statute 9-10 Wm. III c. 41 recites by s. 1 that it
rarely happens that direct proof can be made that such goods have been stolen,
but only that goods so marked were found in the possession of the accused.
Section 2 goes on to provide that “such person or persons in whose
custody, possession or keeping such goods or stores, marked as aforesaid” are
found, should be liable to conviction.

[Page 198]

In Regina v. Cohen[59], the defendant was charged on indictment
under s. 2 with unlawfully having in his possession certain naval stores marked
with the broad arrow. It was held that it was necessary for the Crown to show,
not only that the defendant was possessed of the articles, but also that he
knew they were marked. Watson B. said at p. 42:

I am of opinion that it is necessary, in
order to convict a person under this statute of having naval stores marked with
the broad arrow in his possession, to show not only that he had them in his
possession, but that he also knew the nature of the articles, and that they
were marked with the broad arrow. The statute is no doubt couched in very
general terms; it does not state in so many words that he must have them in his
possession “knowingly,” but that must be the true meaning of the statute.

Hill J. said at p. 43 that

no offence is committed under the second
section unless it is shown that the individual in whose possession or
custody the goods were knew that they were marked with the broad arrow.

A similar case under the same statute arose in Regina
v. Sleep[60], in
which the decision in Cohen’s case was specifically approved. In Sleep’s
case, the Crown contended that upon the true construction of the statute a prima
facie case was made out by showing that the stores were found in the
prisoner’s possession, and that the onus was then cast upon him of “showing
that his possession is innocent.” This contention was negatived, it being held
that it was for the Crown to show that the defendant knew that the goods were
marked goods. Notwithstanding that the statute said nothing about knowingly,
the well settled principle of the criminal law that the defendant must have a
guilty mind, rendered it necessary that the principle should be imported into
the statute. The principle of this decision is embodied in s. 434 of the
Code.

In a case such as the present, namely, retaining
possession of goods recently stolen, the Crown must prove (a) that the
goods were recently stolen, (b) that they were found in the possession
of the accused, and (c) that after the accused acquired possession he learned
of their stolen character. Just as, in a case arising under 9-10 Wm. III, there
is no onus upon the accused to explain anything until the Crown has established
not only possession of the marked goods but that the accused knew they were so
marked,

[Page 199]

equally in the case of an offence of retaining
stolen goods, the Crown must establish not only possession in the accused but
knowledge subsequently acquired of their stolen character. As Roach J.A.
himself says in the court below, there is no presumption establishing such
knowledge.

If it be said that the presumption here under
discussion is applicable to a charge of retaining stolen property knowing it
was stolen, and that the person accused of that offence must go into the
witness box and explain how it was “come by,” it seems to me that those who so
say are also saying something else, namely, that in every charge of retaining
there is included a count of receiving, with respect to which the accused must
clear himself before the Crown will be called upon to do anything in the way of
establishing that after the receipt of the goods the accused learned of their
stolen character. From this it follows that if the explanation of the accused
as to how he “came by” the goods is not accepted, he will be convicted, and, as
the charge is that of retaining, the conviction will also be called retaining,
although in reality, it will be for receiving. Such a procedure merely confuses
the two charges which by definition are separate and distinct. If this view were
permissible, it is difficult to see why the Crown would lay a charge of
receiving in any case.

As the Quebec Court of Appeal pointed out in the
case of Frozocas, a charge of receiving has nothing added to it by words
alleging that the accused retained the goods. On the other hand, if a charge of
retaining were drawn expressly so as to include a charge of receiving, it would
be bad for multiplicity. I come back to the point that on a charge of retaining
as distinct from receiving, the state of mind of an accused person when he
received possession of the goods is not in issue. In Rex v. Bond[61], Kennedy J. said at p. 397:

It may be laid down as a general rule in
criminal as in civil cases that the evidence must be confined to the point in
issue: Roscoe’s Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases, 12th Ed.
(1898) pp. 78, 79. When a prisoner is charged with an offence it is of the
utmost importance to him that the facts laid before the jury should consist
exclusively of the transaction which forms the subject of the indictment which
alone he can be expected to come prepared to answer. It is therefore a
general rule that the facts proved must be strictly relevant to the particular
charge and have no reference to any conduct of the prisoner unconnected

[Page 200]

with such charge; therefore, it is not
allowable to shew on the trial of an indictment that the prisoner has a generel
disposition to commit the same kind of offence as that for which he stands
indicted.

It is said that the decision of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia in The King v. Lum Man Bow[62], was decided in a contrary sense. It is
true that the charge in that case was that the accused did “unlawfully retain
stolen property in their possession” knowing the same to have been stolen, but
when the report is examined, it is plain that the case was treated as one of
receiving and that the distinction between the two offences was not in the mind
of any of the members of the court. The goods there in question which were
stolen on the night of December 3-4, were found, on the afternoon of the 4th,
in the possession of the accused who failed, in the language of the stated
case, “to give a satisfactory account of how they came by the property.”

Macdonald C.J.A., with whom Galliher J.
concurred, referred, in the course of his judgment, to the argument on behalf
of the accused that the only presumption which arose on the facts stated was a
presumption that the accused had stolen the property, which excluded the
presumption that they had retained it knowing it to be stolen. The learned
Chief Justice negatived the contention, stating that in his opinion, the
question was fully covered by the decision in Langmead’s case where, he
said, “precisely the same question arose and where the judges were unanimously
of the opinion that whenever circumstances are such as to render it likely that
the accused did not steal the property, the presumption is that he received it.”
The learned Chief Justice went on to say that in the case he was discussing,
the charge was for retaining, not receiving, and that he thought the principle,
so far as the presumption was concerned, was the same. He said that he adopted
the contention of the Crown that the extension of the Code to the offence of
retaining “was, I think, intended, as Mr. Maclean argued, to remedy a
defect in the law which failed to reach persons who were indicted for the
offence of receiving, but who afterwards were proven to be the thieves. The
same person could not be the thief and the receiver, but under the present section he
may be convicted notwithstanding that it should turn out on the trial that he had
actually

[Page 201]

stolen the
goods.” It is quite evident from this what the idea of the offence of retaining
was in the mind of the learned Chief Justice, and that it was not the offence
which, in my view was created by the provisions of s. 399. The learned Chief
Justice was making two offences out of theft merely from the fact that the
person taking the goods did not immediately pass them on. This is the same contention
applied to “receiving” with which I have already dealt.

It is also quite plain from the judgments of
both Irving and Martin JJ.A. that they treated the case with which they were
dealing as one of receiving. The latter expressly says that he had no doubt
that the conviction of the accused “as receivers” was justified.

This case cannot, therefore, be said to be
authority for the proposition contended for by the Crown in the case at bar.

On behalf of the Crown, we were referred to the
decision of this Court in Richler v. The King[63]. A reference to that case shows that the
conviction there was for “receiving or retaining,” and there is no discussion
in the judgment of retaining as a separate offence. The point here in question
was not raised. The Crown also referred us to Lopatinsky v. The King[64], where the conviction was for retaining.
Again, however, the distinction between the two offences was not raised, and
the evidence in the case was directed entirely to establishing guilty knowledge
at the time the goods were received. While the charge there under discussion
was one of retaining, the offence actually proved was receiving, and no point
was made in the case of any distinction between the two offences. The same is
to be said of Rex v. Pomeroy[65].
The appeal to this court was dismissed, but is unreported. I think, therefore,
that this court is not hampered by anything said in any of the decisions cited,
and that the answer to the first question of law with respect to which leave to
appeal was granted should be that the doctrine does not apply. This brings me
to the second question.

In Regina v. Sleep, ubi cit., appeal
was from a conviction under 9-10 Wm. III c. 41, s. 2, for having been found in
possession of naval stores marked with the broad arrow. The jury, in answer to
questions, found (a) that the goods

[Page 202]

were so marked, (b) that the prisoner had
reasonable means of knowing they were so marked, but (c) that there was
not sufficient evidence he did know. The conviction was set aside,
notwithstanding that in the opinion of the court on appeal, there was abundant
evidence of guilty knowledge, and that the jury ought to have so found.

In the case at bar, the appellant has been
acquitted on the charge of receiving. In my opinion, he ought to have been convicted
on that charge, but there is no appeal as to it, and that being so, there is no
longer any question as to the state of mind of the appellant when he obtained
possession of the guns here in question. It was for the Crown, therefore, to
establish that subsequently, guilty knowledge as to the character of the goods
was acquired by the appellant. In my opinion, the respondent failed to do so.
It was contended that the fact that the name of the owner was on the case in
which one of the guns was contained, was sufficient. Even if this could be said
to be sufficient evidence, which I doubt, it is not to be assumed that this
fact came to the attention of the accused at all, or did not come to his
attention at the time he obtained possession originally. While the learned
trial judge was entitled to give consideration to all the evidence when dealing
with the charge of retaining, there was, in my opinion, no evidence or no
sufficient evidence upon which a conviction on that charge could be supported.
I would therefore allow the appeal and set aside the conviction.

ESTEY J.:—The appellant was tried before a
judge, sitting without a jury, upon an indictment containing four counts:
first, breaking and entering by day and stealing; second, breaking and entering
by night with intent to steal; third, that he did receive a shot gun and a
rifle, knowing they were stolen; and fourth, that he did retain in his
possession the shot gun and rifle, knowing the same to have been stolen. He was
found not guilty under counts one, two and three, but guilty under count four
of retaining the shot gun and rifle. This conviction was affirmed by the
Appellate Court of Ontario.

The evidence established the theft of the shot
gun and rifle and that they were found in the recent possession of the
appellant. The appellant did not give evidence, but his wife was called as a
witness on his behalf and gave an

[Page 203]

explanation as to how the shot gun and rifle had
come into the possession of her husband. At the conclusion of the trial the learned
trial judge stated, in part:

I do not think that the explanation offered
by the defence, in this matter, is a reasonable explanation and am therefore
finding the accused guilty on the evidence, guilty of retaining, and that is
guilty on count four.

Counsel for the accused contends that the
presumption arising out of recent possession does not apply to a charge of
retaining. S. 399  of the Criminal Code , under which counts three and
four were laid, reads as follows:

Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to fourteen years’ imprisonment, who receives or retains in
his possession anything obtained by any offence punishable on indictment, or by
any acts wheresoever committed, which, if committed in Canada would have
constituted an offence punishable upon indictment, knowing such thing to have
been so obtained.

The offence of retaining was not known to the
common law, nor is it included in any of the British statutory offences. In
Canada it was first made an offence by the insertion of the words “or retains”
in the section of our Code of 1892 (S. of C. 1892, c. 29, s. 214). The
language “receives or retains” in s. 214 (now 399) would indicate an intention
on the part of Parliament to treat these offences as separate and distinct.
Such an intention is emphasized by the provision in s. 402 in which it is
provided that the act of receiving is completed as soon as the person has
possession or control over the property. This section has been so
construed in Canada. Rex v. Yeaman[66]; Rex v. Searle[67]; Frozocas v. The King[68]; Ecrement v. The King[69].

The issue here raised was decided adversely to
the contention of counsel for the appellant by the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia in The King v. Lum Man Bow[70]. The Court of Appeal of Ontario, in
affirming the conviction of the appellant, expressly concurred in the view
expressed in The King v. Lum Man Bow. The British Columbia Court
of Appeal based its conclusions largely upon the decision in Reg. v. Langmead[71]. In the Langmead case the accused
was charged with both stealing and

[Page 204]

receiving and his counsel submitted that, as the
evidence proved no more than recent possession by the prisoner, the jury should
have been directed that they could not lawfully find the prisoner guilty of
receiving. This contention was rejected. Pollock, C.B. stated:

* * * the distinction taken by Mr. Carter
between a charge of stealing and one of receiving, with reference to the
effect of evidence of recent possession, is not the law of England. If
no other person is involved in the transaction forming the subject of the
inquiry, and the whole of the case against the prisoner is that he was found in
the possession of the stolen property, the evidence would, no doubt, point to a
case of stealing rather than a case of receiving; but in every case, except,
indeed, where the possession is so recent that it is impossible for any one
else to have committed the theft, it becomes a mere question for the jury
whether the person found in possession of the stolen property stole it himself or
received it from some one else. If, as I have said, there is no other evidence,
the jury will probably consider with reason that the prisoner stole the
property; but, if there is other evidence which is consistent either with his
having stolen the property, or with his having received it from some one else,
it will be for the jury to say which appears to them to be the more probable
solution.

Blackburn, J. stated:

I do not agree with Mr. Carter in
thinking that recent possession is not as vehement evidence of receiving as of
stealing. When it has been shewn that property has been stolen, and has been
found recently after its loss in the possession of the prisoner, he is called
upon to account for having it, and, on his failing to do so, the jury may well infer
that his possession was dishonest, and that he was either the thief or the
receiver according to the circumstances.

In Great Britain where, as already stated, there
is no offence of retaining, the courts have held that recent possession of
stolen property raises a prima facie case or a presumption to the effect
that the accused knew the goods were stolen when he received them. The further
question of whether recent possession should raise a presumption to the same
effect when the offence charged is retaining has, in Great Britain, never been
considered. It would appear, therefore, that in Canada, where the offence of
retaining is contained in the Criminal Code , the answer to the question
must be found in an examination of the nature and character of the presumption
as well as the offence of retaining, and the purpose and object Parliament had
in enacting the same, with a view to ascertaining whether the presumption
should be applied to the offence of retaining as well as to that of receiving,
just as in Reg. v. Langmead it was held that the presumption
applied to receiving as well as to theft.

[Page 205]

In Reg. v. Exall[72], the charge was burglary. Pollock, C.B.
stated to the jury:

The principle is this, that if a person is
found in possession of property recently stolen, and of which he can give no
reasonable account, a jury are justified in coming to the conclusion that
he committed the robbery. And so it is of any crime to which the robbery was
incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson or murder. For, if
the possession be evidence that the person committed the robbery, and the
person who committed the robbery committed the other crime, then it is evidence
that the person in whose possession the property is found committed that other crime.

The law is, that if, recently after the
commission of the crime, a person is found in possession of the stolen goods,
that person is called up to account for the possession, that is, to give
an explanation of it, which is not unreasonable or improbable.

Wills on Circumstantial Evidence, 7th Ed., pp.
93 and 94:

Since the desire of dishonest gain is the
impelling motive to theft and robbery, it naturally follows that the possession
of the fruits of crime recently after it has been committed, affords a strong
and reasonable ground for the presumption that the party in whose possession
they are found was the real offender unless he can account for such possession
in some way consistent with his innocence * * * The force
of this presumption has been recognized from the earliest times; and it is
founded on the obvious consideration, that if such possession had been lawfully
acquired, the party would be able, at least shortly after its acquisition, to
give an account of the manner in which it was obtained; and his unwillingness
or inability to afford such explanation is justly regarded as amounting to
strong self-condemnatory evidence.

Roscoe’s Criminal Evidence, 15th Ed., p. 22:

It has already been stated that possession
is presumptive evidence of property; but where it is proved, or may be
reasonably presumed, from the proved circumstances, that the property in
question is stolen, the onus probandi is shifted, and the possessor, to
rebut an accusation, is bound to explain reasonably that he came by it
honestly; and if he fail to do so, the presumption is that he is the thief or
the receiver, according to the circumstances.

The foregoing quotations indicate that the
presumption of recent possession has no statutory origin, but has developed in
the common law on the basis that reason and experience may justify a conclusion
of guilt where the recent possession of stolen property remains unexplained.
The nature and purpose of such a presumption is emphasized by Thayer,
Preliminary Treatise on Evidence, p. 314:

Presumptions are aids to reasoning and
argumentation, which assume the truth of certain matters for the purpose of
some given inquiry. They may be grounded on general experience, or probability
of any kind; or merely on policy and convenience.

This presumption of recent possession is applied
where a party has been found in possession of stolen property so recently in
relation to the time of the theft thereof that reason and experience lead to
the conclusion that he may either be a party to the theft or has possession of
the property with knowledge of its theft. It is of the utmost importance to
keep in mind that the Crown must first prove that the property has been stolen
and then that it was found in possession of the accused. It is not, however,
the mere possession, but rather the recent possession in relation to the time
of the theft, that raises the presumption and which presumption is rebutted by
a reasonable explanation of honest possession. If the possession of stolen
property is not found to be recent, the presumption does not arise, no matter
what the offence charged may be.

This presumption of fact has not been restricted
in its application to theft and receiving. In Regina v. Exall[73], it was extended to burglary and, as
Pollock, C.B. stated, it applies to “any crime to which the robbery was
incident, or with which it was connected, as burglary, arson or murder.” In
Taylor on Evidence it is pointed out that “The presumption… applies to all
crimes, even the most penal,” and reference is there made to cases of arson,
burglary and murder. Taylor on Evidence, 12th Ed., 135, para. 142. See also
Archibald’s Cr. Pl. Evid. & Pr., 32nd Ed., 404.

It would appear, having regard to the language
of Pollock, C.B. in the Exall case supra, that the offence of
retaining, in relation to this presumption, is as “incident” to, or as
immediately “connected” with the theft as receiving. The issues at a trial of
theft and receiving are quite different. The Queen v. Lamoureux[74]; R. v. Lincoln[75]. A thief cannot receive from himself… R. v.
Langmead supra; R. v. Exall supra. R. v. Carmichael,[76]; R. v. Brown[77]. The offence of receiving contemplates a
person receiving the property after the theft has been completed. Retaining is
in exactly the same position except that the retention contemplates an innocent
receiving, then subsequently, in any appreciable time, however short, the

[Page 207]

acquisition of knowledge that the property was
stolen, and thereafter a retention of same. When the importance of recent
possession in relation to the time of the theft is kept in mind, retaining is
as “incident” to, or as “connected” with the theft as receiving.

It has been emphasized that at common law it was
only the initial possession to which the presumption was applied, not, however,
because of the nature and character of the presumption, but because in the
offence of receiving it was only the knowledge at the moment of the initial
receipt that was in issue. Upon a charge of receiving an accused might have any
amount of subsequent knowledge that the goods were stolen, but, if he received
them innocently, at common law he was not guilty of that or of any other
offence. This was because of the definition of the offence of receiving and not
the nature and character of the presumption, under which an accused found in
recent possession of stolen property might be found guilty in the absence of
any reasonable explanation on his part. In other words, the presumption was
raised against an accused charged with receiving, whether he received the
property with knowledge that it had been stolen, or whether he acquired that
knowledge subsequently to receiving it and then continued to retain the goods,
or, indeed, whether he received and at all times held the property innocently.
He could at common law, however, be found guilty only if he acquired the
possession with guilty knowledge.

The offence under s. 399 , without the words “or
retaining,” is the common law offence of receiving stolen property. One who was
charged with receiving at common law and whose evidence was accepted that he
had received the stolen goods innocently, but that subsequently, in no matter
how short a time, he acquired knowledge that the property was stolen and still
retained it, was not guilty of receiving. Re Richard Johnson[78]; Rex v. Tennet[79]; Rex v. Matthews[80]. The Parliament of Canada concluded that
one who retained stolen property, knowing it to have been stolen, committed an
offence against society as great as that of the receiver and in 1892, while the
bill was passing through Parliament, inserted the words “or retaining” after
the word “receiving” in s. 214 (now 399)

[Page 208]

and placed that offence on the same basis and
provided the same punishment therefor as that of one who received the goods
knowing they were stolen. It would seem that Parliament, by such an enactment,
would intend that the same rules of evidence and presumption should apply to
both offences.

As already stated, the British Columbia Court of
Appeal, in 1910, decided that the presumption of recent possession applied
where the indictment charged that the accused retained stolen property knowing
the property was stolen. The King v. Lum Man Bow supra. While
apparently the question has never been raised in a subsequent case with the
clarity here presented by Mr. Dubin, it appears that in all of the
reported cases subsequent thereto it has been more or less assumed that the
presumption did apply to both receiving and retaining. Rex v. Mandzuk[81]; Rex v. Davis[82]; Rex v. Parker[83]; Rex v. Sullivan and Godbolt[84]; Rex v. Tuck[85]; Rex v. Richler[86]; Rex v. Lopatinsky[87]. It would appear that if Parliament had
not intended that this well known presumption, so long established in our law,
should apply to retaining as well as to receiving that it would, at some date
since 1910, have amended the section by the addition of apt words to that
effect.

Receiving and retaining, as already stated, just
as theft and receiving, are separate and distinct offences and an accused, even
when the evidence of guilty knowledge is found only in the presumption, can
only be found guilty of either theft or receiving, but not both. Upon the same
basis an accused cannot be found guilty of receiving and retaining. The Criminal
Code  contemplates that upon the same facts an accused shall be convicted
and suffer but one punishment. If an accused party receives the guilty
knowledge coincident with possession of the stolen property, he is guilty of
the offence of receiving and not of retaining. If, however, he receives the
property and subsequently acquires knowledge that the property was stolen, and
thereafter continues to retain same, he is guilty of the offence of retaining.
The presumption of recent possession

[Page 209]

applies to all three of these offences and if
counts covering each one are included in the indictment it is for the jury, at
the conclusion of the hearing, to find the accused guilty of one or other, or
not guilty of all of these offences. Pollock, C.B., in Reg. v. Langmead
supra, expresses this view as to theft and receiving, and, following his
analogy, if the evidence of guilty knowledge adduced by the prosecution is
restricted to that arising out of the presumption of recent possession and no
further evidence is adduced, a jury would probably conclude that the accused
was guilty of receiving. If, however, there is other evidence, it will be for
the jury to say whether the accused be guilty of either receiving or retaining,
or not guilty of either.

While the offences of receiving and retaining
are separate and distinct, the essential difference is the time of the acquisition
of knowledge on the part of the accused. In all other essentials there is no
great difference. The existence of the motive for dishonest gain referred to in
Wills on Circumstantial Evidence supra as a basis for the presumption is
of no greater significance in relation to receiving than to retaining.

It would appear, therefore, that the submission
that the presumption applies to retaining as well as to receiving is justified
in principle. The language adopted by Parliament would seem to have contemplated
its application to the offence of retaining, and this view finds support in
that Parliament has not, since Lum Man Bow supra was decided in 1910,
enacted any amendment in respect of this section.

The explanation here given related to the
initial reception of the stolen property and was disbelieved by the learned
trial judge. With great respect, upon that finding the accused should have been
found guilty of receiving. There was no evidence that justified the conclusion
that he received the goods without knowledge of their having been stolen and
subsequently acquired such knowledge and thereafter continued to retain same.
Learned counsel for the Crown suggests that, because the accused sold the rifle
for $20, when the evidence disclosed that its replacement cost would be $68,
therefore there was an inference of subsequent knowledge, but this he may well
have done, because he knew it was stolen when he received it. Certainly there
is no fact here established to suggest he received it at any other time.

[Page 210]

He next drew attention to the fact that the
purchaser of the rifle found the owner’s name thereon, which aroused his
suspicion and caused him to communicate with the police. The evidence
establishes that the name was not at all conspicuous and was only found by the
purchaser when he was cleaning the rifle, nor is it suggested throughout the
evidence that the accused knew of the presence of that name. Counsel then
referred to the fact that the hunters never came back. The difficulty with
regard to the hunters is that the only evidence of their existence forms a part
of the explanation which the learned trial judge did not believe.

In my opinion, with great respect, the evidence
here adduced on the part of the Crown justified a conviction for receiving,
upon which the learned trial judge acquitted and from which no appeal has been
taken and which is, therefore, not before this Court. The evidence does not
support a conviction of retaining, as that offence is constituted under s. 399 .

The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
quashed.

Appeal allowed and conviction set
aside.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEAL
OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Criminal Code —s. 286 —Theft—Grand Juries—Sufficient
Evidence for true bill.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Criminal Appeal of Prince Edward Island ([1]),
Campbell C.J. and Tweedy and McGuigan JJ., dismissing the accused's appeal from
his conviction and sentence following his trial before McGuigan J. and a jury on a charge of theft under s. 386  of the Criminal
Code . Following a preliminary inquiry a grand
jury returned a true bill on the indictment. Prior to the swearing of
the petit jury appellant's counsel moved to quash on the grounds that the grand
jury had examined only one witness and that from the evidence given by him at the preliminary hearing the Crown had failed to
establish the identity, ownership or unlawful conversion of the goods, essential elements of the offence charged.
In support of the motion Rex v.
Court ([2])
was cited and the judgment of Campbell C.J. therein that an indictment found by a grand jury on inadmissible or inadequate
material must be quashed. The motion
was refused and the trial proceeded
with. On the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and before this
Court the same ground was pressed, as well as misdirection and non-direction by
the trial judge.

D. L. Mathieson K.C. for the appellant. 

J. O. C. Campbell
K.C. for the
respondent.

At the close of
the appellant's argument the Court retired. On its return to the bench, Kerwin
J. speaking for the Court stated: It will not be
necessary to call on you, Mr. Camp-bell. On
the first point we express no opinion on the








[Page 123]

correctness of the decision in Rex v. Court.
It is sufficient to say there is nothing
in this case to show that the grand jury did not have before it
sufficient evidence to justify it bringing in
a true bill. On the other points we are all of opinion that while there were errors in the trial judge's charge
to the jury, those errors were immediately corrected upon them being called to the judge's attention by Counsel for the appellant. In the circumstances, it cannot
be said that the trial judge did not put before the jury the defence raised on behalf of the appellant.

The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

PAUL LEMAY APPELLANT; 

AND 

HIS MAJESTY THE KING RESPONDENT. 

PRESENT: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin,
Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Criminal Law-Evidence-Sale of drugs-Denial
by accused-Proof of identification-Duty of Crown as to calling
witnesses-Whether notice of appeal must be signed by Attorney General-Power of
Court of Appeal to reverse acquittal and enter conviction-Opium and Narcotic
Drug Act, 1929, S. of C. 1929, c. 49-Criminal Code , es. 1013(4), 1014, 1023(2).

The appellant was
charged with having unlawfully sold a drug. The evidence for the prosecution
was that Bunyk, an officer of the R.C.M.P., saw the accused, who was already
known to him, sitting at a table in a restaurant. Bunyk, who was at the time
accompanied by an. informer, one Powell, could not say whether Powell saw the
accused or not. Bunyk entered the restaurant alone and sat down beside the
accused at whose table one Lowes was also sitting, and thereupon purchased the
drug from the accused. Neither Powell nor Lowes was called as a witness. The
accused denied that he was the man from whom the purchase was made and
testified that he was not present, he also denied any knowledge of any person
named Lowes. The proceedings were by way of speedy trial, and the trial judge,
although stating that he disbelieved the accused, acquitted him because of the
failure of the prosecution to call Lowes or account for his absence. The appeal
taken by the Crown was allowed and a conviction entered.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed (Cartwright J., dissenting in part, would have
ordered a new trial).

Held, that
counsel acting for the prosecution has full discretion as to what witnesses
should be called for the prosecution and the Court will not interfere with the
exercise of that discretion unless it can be shown that the prosecutor has been
influenced by some oblique motive (of which there is here no suggestion). This is
not to be regarded as lessening the duty of the prosecutor to bring forward
evidence of every material fact known to the prosecution whether favourable to
the accused or otherwise. The appeal should be dismissed since there was no
obligation on the Crown to call either Powell or Lowes at the trial. (Adel
Muhammed El Dabbah v. A.G. for Palestine [1944] A.C. 156 applied; Rex
v. Seneviratne [1936] 3 All E.R. 36 explained).

(Rex v. Lemay (100
Can. C.C. 367), a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
in an appeal by the same accused from his previous conviction on the same
charge and ordering a new trial, overruled).

Per Locke
J.: Since the Criminal Code is silent, the Criminal Law of England as it
existed on the 19th day of November, 1858, governs the matter. If what appears
to have been considered as a rule of practice prior to 1858 had become part of
the common law of England, the








[Page 233]

principle
applicable was as stated in R. v. Woodhead (1847) 2 C. & K. 520, and
R. v. Cassidy (1858) 1 F. & F. 79, and the Crown was under no
obligation to call either Powell or Lowes as a witness. (R. v. Sing (1932)
50 B.C.R. 32 and R. v. Hop Lee (1941) 56 B.C.R. 151 referred to).

Held also,
that since it is not expressed either explicitly or inferentially in s. 1013(4) 
of the Criminal Code  that the Attorney General should personally sign
the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal, there is no substance to the
objection that the notice was signed by B. as agent for the Attorney General of
British Columbia. (Locke J. agreed with Robertson J.A. that the signature by
the agent was sufficient since the appeal was substantially and actually in the
name of, and for, the Attorney General of British Columbia).

Held further,
following Beleyea v. The King [1932] S.C.R. 279, that the Court of
Appeal had the power to enter a conviction, it appearing that not only did the
trial judge not accept or believe the accused's testimony but he believed and
accepted the evidence of the R.C.M.P. officer, and that he dismissed the charge
only because he considered wrongly that the Crown had to call Lowes or account
for his absence. (Cartwright J., dissenting in part, would have ordered a new
trial on the ground that it did not appear certain but only probable that the
trial judge would have convicted but for his erroneous ruling on the point of
law).



APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia [1], allowing, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting, the
Crown's appeal from the accused's acquittal at trial on a charge of unlawful
sale of drugs.



J. Stevenson Hall for the appellant. S. 1013(4)  of the Criminal
Code  gives the right of appeal to the Attorney General and the power to
appeal cannot be delegated by the Attorney General. Therefore the notice of
appeal to the Court of Appeal signed by B. as agent for the Attorney General of
British Columbia was not proper in farm and in accordance with s. 1013(4) of
the Code (Rex v. Gallant [2]and Rex v. Perry [3].



Powell and Lowes were
essential Crown witnesses who were present throughout the major part of the
transaction of selling between Lemay and Bunyk, and should, therefore, have
been called as witnesses. The appellant relies in this respect upon the
dissenting judgment of O'Halloran JA. and the cases therein referred to, and
specially to Rex v. Seneviratne [4] and Rex v. Guerin[5].








[Page 234]



The Court of Appeal
erred in directing a conviction to be entered. If the setting aside of the
acquittal is upheld, a new trial should be directed, since it does not appear
from the judgment of the trial judge that he was satisfied of facts which
proved the accused guilty. He stated that he disbelieved the accused but does
not state expressly, nor does it follow by irresistible inference from anything
he does say, that he accepted the evidence of Bunyk. He does not say that, but
for the rule of law which he applied, he would have found the accused guilty.
It is not certain that he would have convicted the accused. (Rex v. Gun Ying[6] and Rex v. Tonelli[7].



Douglas McKay Brown
for the respondent. The
narrative had been completely unfolded by Bunyk. The evidence of Lowes was not
essential to the unfolding of the narrative and under the circumstances of the
evidence, the Crown was not obliged to call him as a witness. There was no duty
on the part of the Crown to call Lowes, who was associating with the accused, a
known criminal engaged in the drug traffic. From the principles laid down in Rex
v. Seneviratne (supra) and Rex v. Hop Lee[8]), it is clear: (a) There is no general obligation on
the part of the Crown to call every available witness; (b) Their
Lordships refused to lay down any rule to fetter discretion on a matter such as
this which is so dependent on the particular circumstances of each case; (c)
That, speaking generally, they could not approve of an idea that the
prosecution must call witnesses irrespective of consideration of number, and of
reliability, or that 'the prosecution ought to discharge the functions both of
prosecution and defence; (d) Witnesses essential to the unfolding of the
narrative on which the prosecution is' based must be called by the prosecution
whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or against the case
for the prosecution. Under the circumstances of the present case, it was not
mandatory on the part of the Crown to call Lowes or Powell as a witness. In the
case of Adel Muhammed El Dabbah v. A.G. for Palestine [9], it was stated that the prosecutor has a discretion as
to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution, and the Court will not
interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless, perhaps, it

[Page 235]










can be shown that the
prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive. There is no suggestion
of such a motive here. The Crown, therefore, exercised that discretion in not
calling Powell or Lowes as witnesses.



There is a distinction
to be made between the Crown's duty of calling witnesses and the question of
identification.



In view of the
decision of this Court in Beleyea v. The King[10], the Court of Appeal had the power to convict the
accused. Since the trial judge would have convicted if he had not considered
that in law he could not, therefore the Court of Appeal was right in doing what
it did.



S. 1013(4)  of the
Criminal Code  does not say that the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal must
be signed personally by the Attorney General. It is sufficient if the appeal is
substantially and 'actually taken in the name of the Attorney General. The
present case is different from that of Rex v. Gallant (supra) cited by
the appellant.



The ease of Rex v.
Lee Fong Shee[11] is cited to show the clandestine nature of the drug
traffic and the difficulty to obtain a conviction.



The judgment of the
Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock, Estey and Fauteux JJ. was
delivered by










KERWIN J.:-The
appellant Lemay was charged with having sold 'a drug to Steven Bunyk, on
September 21, 1950, at Vancouver contrary to the provisions of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, as amended. Lemay was tried on that charge and
acquitted by His Honour Judge Sargent in the County Court Judges' Criminal
Court. On an appeal by the Crown to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [12] that acquittal was set aside, a
conviction entered, and the case remitted to the trial judge for sentence.
Under subsection 2 of section 1023 of the Code as enacted
by section 30 of chapter '55 of the Statutes of 1947, Lemay now appeals to this
Court alleging that his conviction was erroneous on two grounds (a) the Court
of Appeal erred in finding that it was not essential that the Crown call as a
witness one Henry Powell, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police informer, and one Art
Lowes, both of whom it was alleged were present throughout the

[Page 236]



major part of the
transaction of selling between the appellant and Bunyk; (b) the notice of
appeal to the Court of Appeal, which was signed ""Douglas McKay Brown,
Agent for the Attorney General of British Columbia"", was not proper in
form or in accordance with section 1013(4)  of the Criminal Code  as
enacted by section 28  of chapter 11 of the Statutes of 1930. These grounds will
be considered in order.



Steven Bunyk, who is
'a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, testified that he had known
Lemay by sight for some time previous to 21st September, 1950, having seen him
on about twelve occasions and having seen his picture several times. He
described Henry Powell as a coloured boy used by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police and paid by them as an informer. Powell had pointed Lemay out to Bunyk
on the street, and on September 20, the two of them went to see Lemay in room
10 in a rooming house in Vancouver known as the Beacon Rooms. Failing to find
Lemay there, Bunyk, still 'accompanied by Powell, proceeded to depart when he
saw Lemay at the head of the stairs leading to the ground floor, whereupon
Lemay said to Bunyk : ""I thought you were coming as I saw you pass the
cafe several times."" Nothing else was said upon that occasion.



On the next day,
September 21 (the date of the alleged offence), Bunyk and Powell walked in a
westerly direction, on the south side of Hastings Street, towards the Malina
Cafe. The door to the cafe is on the east side of the cafe with a window
immediately to the west. Bunyk looked through that window and saw Lemay sitting
in a booth on the west side of the cafe. Bunyk could not say that Powell saw the
accused. Bunyk entered the cafe and sat down near Lemay in the booth and there
the transaction occur-red, which is the basis of the charge. It is not denied
that on that 'occasion Bunyk paid three dollars and received the drug but Lemay
denied that he was the man from whom the purchase was made and testified that
he was not present. Also sitting in the booth was the other man referred to,
known to Bunyk as Art Lowes. The accused denies any knowledge of such a person.
He denies knowing Bunyk or seeing or speaking to him on September 20 or 21. He
admits that he lived in room 10 in the Beacon Rooms

[Page 237]










for some time prior to
September 20 but states he moved from there on that date. While he says he was
away from Vancouver during parts of August and September, he admits being in
the city on September 20 and 21 and that on some occasions he had taken his meals
at the Malina Cafe.



Neither Powell nor
Lowes was called as a witness. For some time prior to September 20, Bunyk was
acting as an under cover agent and he stated that Powell came from the United
States and that he did not know where he was. Then the following question and
answer appear in the record:‑



Q. Do you know of
any inquiries which have been made to locate him?



A. Inquiries were
made to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in Seattle but they have failed to locate
him.



As to Lowes, Bunyk
'testified that he knew him to see him but that he had no idea how Lowes happened
to be with Lemay on September 21 and that Lowes had no connection with the case
as far as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was concerned and that Lowes was
not an operator for that organization.



Prior to the hearing
before His Honour Judge Sargent, Lemay had been convicted on the same charge by
His Honour Judge Boyd, but that conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal
[13], consisting of O'Halloran, J.A.,
Robertson, J.A., and Sidney Smith, J.A. (dissenting), on the ground that Powell
had not been called as a witness. On the Crown's appeal from the acquittal on
the new trial, Sidney Smith, J.A., adhered to the view that he had ex-pressed
on the prior appeal, while Robertson, J.A., decided that on the second trial it
appeared that Powell had not looked through the window. As to Lowes, he
considered that 'the fact that that individual was associated with a drug
pedlar, as Lemay was found to be, probably convinced the Crown that his
evidence would not be reliable. He pointed out that the fact that Lowes was
present was made known at the preliminary hearing and, notwithstanding this,
counsel for Lemay did not ask that Lowes be subpoenaed or for an 'adjournment
to permit him to have him before the Court, and that the Court was not bound to
discharge the functions of the defence. O'Halloran J.A.








[Page 238]



dissented. He retained
the view he had held on the prior appeal as to Powell because he considered the
explanation of Powell's absence was of a vague and general character. That view
was to the effect that there is a rule whereby the Crown was bound to call
Powell as a witness essential to the unfolding of the narrative. He also
considered that it was difficult to avoid the reflection that if Lowes could
have identified Lemay, the Crown would not have failed to call him,
particularly since the Crown knew from the first trial that Lemay denied being
in the cafe and, there-fore, on the same basis, that the Crown was bound to
call him as a witness. He proceeded further to deal with what he described as a
fundamental aspect, viz., the trial judge's attitude towards Lemay's testimony.
These views of the learned Justice ,of Appeal cannot be accepted since it is
plain upon a reading of the reasons of the trial judge that he believed the
evidence of Bunyk and certainly he categorically stated that he did not believe
the evidence of Lemay. The trial judge had the witnesses before him and it was
not necessary that he itemize the reasons which led him to conclude that
Lemay's evidence was not to be believed.



While certain
decisions in the British Columbia Courts are referred to in the reasons for
judgment in the Court of Appeal, as well on the first appeal as on the second,
all the arguments on behalf of Lemay in connection with the first ground of
appeal are garnered from the following statement in the judgment of Lord Roche,
speaking on behalf of the Judicial Committee in Seneviratne v. Rex[14]. ""Witnesses essential to the unfolding of the
narrative on which the prosecution is based must, of course, be called by the
prosecution whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or
against the case for the prosecution."" Now, in addition to this statement
being obiter as Lord Roche clearly stated, it also appears from page 48
of the first report and page 377 of the second, that he was dealing with the
case of the maid Alpina (and similar cases) whose good faith was not questioned
by the Crown, and pointed out that what she had said was given apparently
without previous cross-examination as to other and previous oral statements

[Page 239]



 It was pointed out
that this was both undesirable and not permitted by any sections of the Ceylon
Law of Evidence Ordinance. Lord Roche continued:










It is said that
the state of things above described arose because of a supposed obligation on
the prosecution to call every available witness on the principle laid down in
such a case as Ram Ranjan Roy v. R. ((1914) 1 L.R. 42 Cale., 422: 14
Digest 273, 2816 (ii)) to the effect that all available eye-witnesses should be
called by the prosecution even though, as in the case cited, their names were
on the list of defence witnesses. Their Lordships do not desire to lay down any
rules to fetter discretion on a matter such as this which is so dependent on
the particular circumstances of each case. Still less do they desire to
discourage the utmost candour and fairness on the part of those conducting
prosecutions; but at the same time they cannot, speaking generally, approve of
an idea that a prosecution must call witnesses irrespective of considerations
of number and of reliability or that a prosecution ought to discharge the
functions both of prosecution and defence. If it does so confusion is very apt
to result, and never is it more likely to result than if the prosecution calls
witnesses and then proceeds almost automatically to discredit them by
cross-examination.



Then follows the
statement relied on. In truth Lord Roche was dealing with an entirely different
matter, and reading the whole of his reasons it is clear that not only was he
not laying down any such rule as that here asserted but one directly contrary
to it.



It is made abundantly
plain from the subsequent decision of the Judicial Committee in Adell
Muhammed v. A.G. for Palestine[15], delivered by Lord Thankerton (which was not brought
to the attention of the Court of Appeal), that no such rule as has been
contended for, and apparently applied by the majority of that Court on the first
appeal and by the dissenting judge on the second appeal, has ever been laid
down. The earlier cases are referred to in the argument of counsel for the
accused in the Palestine case but Seneviratne v. Rex is not mentioned.
At pages 167, 168 and 169, Lord Thankerton deals with the contention that the
accused had a right to have the witnesses whose names were on the information
but who were not called to give evidence for the prosecution, tendered by the
Crown for cross-examination by the defence. Their Lordships agreed with the
trial judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal in Palestine that there was no
obligation on the prosecution to tender these witnesses. However, while the
Court of Criminal Appeal had held that that was the strict position

[Page 240]










in law, they expressed
the opinion that the better practice was that the witnesses should be tendered
at the close of the case for the prosecution so that the defence might
cross-examine them if they wished, and the Court desired to lay down as a rule
of practice that in future this practice of tendering witnesses should be
generally followed. Their Lordships of the Judicial Committee doubted whether
that rule of practice as expressed by the Court of Criminal Appeal sufficiently
recognized that the prosecutor has a discretion and that the Court will not
interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless perhaps it could be shown
that the prosecutor had been influenced by some oblique motive. Lord Thankerton
referred to the judgment of Baron Alderson in Reg. v. Woodhead[16], that the prosecutor is not bound to 'call witnesses
merely because their names are on the back of the indictment; that they should
be in Court but that they were to be called by the party who wanted their
evidence. Lord Thankerton also referred to Reg. v. Cassidy[17] where
Baron Parke, after consultation with Cresswell J. stated the rule in similar
terms. Lord Thankerton does go on to say that it is consistent with the
discretion of counsel for the prosecutor, which is thus recognized, that it
should be a general practice of prosecuting counsel, if they find no sufficient
reason to the contrary, to tender such witnesses for cross-examinaion by the
defence, but it remains a matter for the prosecutor's discretion. Reference was
also made to an interlocutory remark by Lord Hewart in Rex v. Harris[18] : ""in criminal cases the prosecution is bound to
call all the material witnesses before the court, even though they give
inconsistent accounts, in order that the whole of the facts may be before the
jury."" Lord Thankerton said that in their Lordships' view, the Chief
Justice could not have intended to negative the long-established right of the
prosecutor to exercise his discretion to determine who the material witnesses
are.



In the present case
there did not appear on the back of the charge sheet the name of any witness
but that fact is unimportant. Powell and Lowes did not give evidence at the
preliminary inquiry. There was no obligation on the Crown to call either of
them at the trial and we are therefore

[Page 241]










not concerned with the
question whether the explanation of Powell's absence was satisfactory or not.
Of course, the Crown must not hold back evidence because it would assist an
accused but there is no suggestion that this was done in the present case or,
to use the words of Lord Thankerton, ""that the prosecutor had been
influenced by some oblique motive."" It is idle to rely upon such
expressions as this or the one used by Lord Roche without relating them to the
matters under discussion but the important thing is that unless there are some
particular circumstances of the nature envisaged, the prosecutor is free to
exercise his discretion to determine who are the material witnesses.



The second ground of
appeal may be disposed of in a few words. Subsection 4 of section 1013 of the Code
enacts:



(4) Notwithstanding
anything in this Act contained, the Attorney General shall have the right to
appeal to the court of appeal against any judgment or verdict of acquittal of a
trial court in respect of an indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves
a question of law alone.



It is not contended
that Mr. Brown was not the agent of the Attorney General of British Columbia or
that he did not have the latter's authority to institute the appeal to the
British Columbia Court of Appeal but it is said that at least the Attorney
General personally should have signed the notice of appeal. It is sufficient to
say that it is not so expressed in the subsection, either explicitly or
inferentially, and that there is no substance to the objection.



In registering a
conviction, the Court of Appeal had the authority of this Court in Belyea v.
The King[19]. It was there pointed out that by section 1014  of the Criminal
Code , the powers of a Court of Appeal on hearing 'an appeal by a person
convicted are, under subsection 3, in the event of the appeal being allowed, to



(a) quash the
conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered, or



(b) direct 'a new
trial; and in either case may make such other order as justice requires.



This section is made
applicable on an appeal by the Attorney General against an acquittal by the
provisions of subsection 5 of section 1013 as enacted by section 28 of chapter
11 of the Statutes of 1930, that mutatis mutandis

[Page 242]



(1) on the appeal
thereby given, the Court shall have the same powers as it has on an appeal by
the accused. Chief Justice Anglin pointed out that while it seemed rather a
strong thing to hold that the effect of the words mutatis mutandis is that
that clause must be made to read ""on an appeal by the Attorney General to










(a) quash the acquittal and direct a
judgment and verdict of conviction to be entered;""



yet that apparently
was the construction put upon the provision by the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Ontario. Chief Justice Anglin continued by stating that while
it had occurred to some members of this Court that the correct course would be
to apply clause (b) and to direct 'a new trial, the Court was merely affirming
the facts found by the trial judge and upon them reached the conclusion that
the only course open to the Appellate Division was to allow the appeal and
convict the accused.



Upon reading the
reasons for judgment of His Honour Judge Sargent, I am convinced that not only
did he not accept or believe the 'appellant's testimony but he believed and
accepted the evidence of Bunyk and it was only be-cause he considered himself
bound by the previous decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia that
he dismissed the charge.



The appeal should be
dismissed.



RAND J.:-I think it
clear from the authorities cited that no such absolute duty rests on the
prosecution as the Court of Appeal in the earlier proceeding held. Material
witnesses in this context are those who can testify to material facts, but
obviously that is not identical with being ""essential to the unfolding of
the narrative."" The duty of the prosecutor to see that no unfairness is
done the accused is entirely compatible with discretion as to witnesses; the
duty of the Court is to see that the balance between these is not improperly
disturbed.



On the other two
points also, I concur, and the appeal must be dismissed.

[Page 243]



LOCKE J. :The
appellant, Paul Lemay, was in the month of September 1950 charged with having,
at the City of Vancouver, sold a narcotic drug to one Stephen Bunyk, contrary
to the provisions of the Opium and Narcotic Drugs Act, and on that
charge, after a preliminary enquiry, was committed for trial by the Deputy
Police Magistrate on October 6, 1950.



At the preliminary
hearing, evidence for the Crown was given by Bunyk, an officer in the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, to the effect that he had on September 21, 1950,
proceeded to ,a restaurant on Hastings Street in Vancouver, in company with one
Powell, and entering the restaurant alone purchased the drug from Lemay in the
presence of one Art Lowes.










Thereafter, having
elected to take a speedy trial before His Honour Judge Bruce Boyd, a judge of
the County Court at Vancouver, he was found guilty and sentenced to a term of
imprisonment and a fine. Powell, an informer in the employ of the Mounted
Police, who had not entered the restaurant with Bunyk, was not called by the
Crown at the trial before the learned County Court Judge, though the fact that
he had accompanied Bunyk to the restaurant was mentioned. I would infer from
the reasons for judgment delivered upon this appeal that the name of Lowes was
not mentioned at the trial and it is clear that he was not called as a witness.
The present Appellant appealed to the Court ,of Appeal for British Columbia [20] and that court, by ,a decision of the
majority (Sidney Smith J.A. dissenting), set the conviction aside upon the
ground that as, apparently, Powell had seen the accused in the restaurant his
evidence was material on the question of identification, and that there was an
obligation on the prosecution to call him. Adopting an expression used by Lord
Roche, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Rex v.
Seneviratne[21], that witnesses essential to the ""unfolding of
the narrative on which the prosecution is based"" must be called by the
prosecution, O'Halloran J.A., with whom Robertson J.A. agreed, said in part:



If all material
witnesses are not called by the prosecution, the defence is thereby deprived of
the opportunity for cross-examination, and to that extent an accused is denied
the right of full defence which our courts have long recognized as essential to
a fair trial.

[Page 244]










Lemay appeared for
trial again before His Honour Judge R. A. Sargent of the County Court of
Vancouver on. February 8, 1951, and was represented by counsel. Bunyk gave
evidence that Powell had accompanied him to the restaurant and had not entered
and, while not mentioning in his evidence in chief the presence of Lowes, did
so in cross-examination, saying that Lowes was sitting in a booth in the
restaurant with Lemay when he had purchased the drug. Describing thé
transaction he said that Lemay had in his hand a fingerstall containing
capsules wrapped in silver paper when he (Bunyk) sat down opposite him in the
booth and asked if he could get one, whereupon Lemay took .one of the capsules
and placed it on the table in front of him and he thereupon paid Lemay $3.00.
Some evidence was given at the hearing of efforts made by the Crown to locate
Powell and of their failure but, in the view that I take of this matter, it is
unnecessary to consider its sufficiency since if the Crown was .under .a legal
obligation to call Powell or account for his absence, clearly there was the
same obligation in respect of Lowes who saw the whole transaction, and no
effort was made to account for the failure to call him.



It is of importance to
note that while the appellant had known from the date of the preliminary
hearing before the Deputy Police Magistrate that Bunyk had, according to his
story, been accompanied by Powell to the restaurant and had purchased the drug
in the presence of Art Lowes, no request was made at the commencement of the
trial before His Honour Judge Sargent or during the course of the trial for a
direction that the Crown should either call them or assist the defence in
locating them, or for an adjournment so that they could be located. The only
evidence of identification was that of Constable Bunyk who, while .a police
officer, had been working under cover in Vancouver and who had during a period
of weeks before the date of the purchase seen Lemay a number of times. Lemay's
defence was simply a complete denial of the whole affair and he swore that he
had never seen Bunyk before the latter appeared in the Police Court to give
evidence. As to Lowes, he said that while he might know him he did

[Page 245]



not know him by that
name. On the question of credibility, the learned trial judge, in giving
judgment, said in part :



The accused went
into the box and categorically denied any sale of narcotics and the testimony
of Bunyk in toto. He further states that he did not know Lowes, at least
by name. These denials I do not accept, nor do I believe his testimony.



Then saying that he
did not feel that there was sufficient evidence to make a finding as to whether
Powell did or did not see the transaction, that the evidence had shown that
Lowes was not connected with Bunyk or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and
that no explanation had been given as to why he had not been called or what, if
any, attempts had been made to find him, after quoting from the judgment of
O'Halloran J.A. as to the obligation of the Crown to call all material
witnesses, dismissed the charge against the prisoner.










The Attorney-General
of the Province of British Columbia appealed to the Court of Appeal[22] under the provisions of subsection 4  of
section 1013  of the Criminal Code  and that Court, by a decision of the
majority (O'Halloran J.A. dissenting) allowed the appeal, set the acquittal
aside and directed that a conviction be entered and the case remitted to the
trial judge for sentence.



The appellant alleges
two errors in the judgment appealed from : the first, that the notice of appeal
to the 'Court of Appeal which was signed by Douglas Mackay Brown, agent for the
Attorney-General of British Columbia, was an insufficient compliance with
section 1013(4) of the Code, and the second, in finding that it was not
essential to the Crown to call Powell and Lowes as witnesses at the trial.



As to the first of
these points there was no disagreement in the Court of Appeal and I
respectfully agree with Mr. Justice Robertson that the signature by the agent
of the Attorney-General was sufficient.



The contention of the
appellant upon the second point is that, as stated by Mr. Justice O'Halloran,
Lowes and Powell were material witnesses on the question of the identification
of Lemay and there was an obligation in law upon the Crown to call them. For
the Crown it is said that it is for the Crown prosecutor, as the representative

[Page 246]



of His Majesty, to
decide what evidence is to be called for the prosecution and that, subject to
something in the nature of bad faith on his part, such as endeavouring to
obtain a conviction by suppressing the truth (in which event the trial judge
could properly intervene), his decision in the matter may not be interfered
with. It is perhaps unnecessary to say that there is no suggestion of any such
impropriety on the part of those representing the Crown at the preliminary
hearing and the trial of this matter.










Since the Criminal
Code is silent on. the matter, the obligation contended for by the
appellant, if it exists, must be part of the common law of British Columbia.
The question, or one closely allied to it, has been considered in a number of
decisions in England. In R. v. Simmonds[23], where counsel for the Crown declined to call a
witness whose name appeared on the back of the Indictment, Hui-lock B. said
that, though the prosecution were not bound to call every witness whose name
was on the indictment, it was usual to do so and, if it was not done, he as the
judge would call the witness so that the prisoner's counsel might have an
opportunity to cross-examine him. In a note to this case there is a reference
to R. v. Witebread, where on 'a trial for larceny the prosecution
omitted to call an apprentice of the prosecutor who had been implicated in the
theft and who had been examined at the police office and before the grand jury
and whose name was on the back of the indictment. Counsel for the prisoner
contended that the witness ought to be called but counsel for the prosecution
declined, saying that the prisoner's counsel might himself call him if he
chose. Holroyd and Burrough JJ. held that the prosecutor's counsel was not
bound to call all the witnesses whose names were on the indictment merely to
let the other side cross-examine them. The note further reports, however, that
in the case of R. v. John Taylor, tried in the same year, Park J. called
all the witnesses whose names appeared on the back of the indictment whom the
prosecutor had not called, merely to allow the prisoner's counsel to
cross-examine them. In R. v. Beezley[24], Littledale J. said that counsel for the prosecution
who had closed his case without calling all of the witnesses whose names were
on the indictment should call all of them, in

[Page 247]



order to give the
prisoner's counsel an opportunity of cross-examining them. In R. v. Bodle [25], where the charge was murder and counsel for the Crown
declined to call the father of the prisoner whose name was on the back of the
indictment, Gaselee J., having conferred with Mr. Baron Vaughan, said that they
were both of the opinion that if counsel for the prosecution declined to call a
witness whose name is on the back of the indictment it is in the discretion of
the judge who tries the case to say whether the witness should be called for
the prisoner's counsel to examine him, before the prisoner is called on for his
defence. In R. v. Holden[26], the charge was murder. The Crown did not call the
daughter of the deceased person who, apparently had been present when the
offence was committed, whose name was not on the back of the indictment and who
was in court. Patteson J. said that she should be called and that every witness
who was present at a transaction of that kind, even if they give different
accounts, should be heard by the jury so as to draw their own conclusion as to
the real truth of the matter. There had been a postmortem examination of the
body of the deceased in the presence of three surgeons but, of these, only two
were called to give evidence for the Crown, though the third was in court.
Patteson J. said that he was aware that the name of this person was not on the
back of the indictment but that as he was in court he would insist on his being
examined and said :










He is a material
witness who was not called on the part of the prosecution and as he is in court
I shall call him for the furtherance of justice.



In R. v. Bull[27], counsel for the Crown said that there was one witness
examined before the grand jury whom, on account of information he had since
received, it was not his intention to call as a witness for the prosecution; on
counsel for the prisoner objecting that it was unfair not to examine all those
whose names were on the back of the bill and Crown counsel saying that his
intention was to put the witness into the box, Vaughan J. said that the proper
course was to put the witness into the box and that:

[Page 248]



every witness
ought to be examined. In cases of this kind counsel ought not to keep back a
witness because his evidence may weaken the case for the prosecution.



In R. v. Stroner[28], Pollock C.B. directed the prosecution to call two
persons as witnesses for the prosecution whose evidence he considered to be
material and whose names were not on the back of the indictment but who were in
court as witnesses for the accused. In R. v. Barley[29], where the prosecution did not call two witnesses
whose names were on the back of the indictment, Pollock C.B. after consulting
with Coleridge J. intimated that the witnesses ought to be called by counsel
for the prosecution, whereupon the witnesses were placed in the box and sworn
on the part of the Crown and cross-examined on behalf of the prisoner.



The practice in the
matter appears to have been clarified in 1847 when in R. v. Woodhead[30], where counsel for the Crown, after stating the case
for the prosecution, had observed that he did not deem it necessary to call all
the witnesses whose names were on the back of the indictment, unless counsel
for the prisoner should desire it, Alderson B. said:



You are aware, I
presume, of the rule which the judges have lately laid down, that a prosecutor
is not bound to call witnesses merely because their names are on the back of
the indictment. The witnesses, however, should be here, because the prisoner
might otherwise be misled; he might, from their names being on the bill, have
relied on your bringing them here, and have neglected to bring them himself.
You ought, there-fore, to have them in court, but they are to be called by the
party who wants their evidence. This is the only sensible rule.



Counsel for the
prisoner then asked whether if he called these persons he would make them his
own witnesses, to which Alderson B. replied :










Yes, certainly.
That is the proper course, and one which is consistent with other rules of
practice. For instance, if they were called by the prosecutor, it might be
contended that he ought not to give evidence to shew them unworthy of credit,
however falsely the witnesses might have deposed.



In R. v. Cassidy[31], where the prosecutor refused to call a witness whose
name was on the back of the indictment and counsel for the prisoner contended
that ""according to the usual practice"" he ought in fairness to do so,
Baron Parke said that while the usual course was for the prosecutor to call the
witness and, if he declined to examine, the prisoner might cross-examine him,
he thought the practice

[Page 249]



did not stand upon any
very clear or correct principle and was supported only on the authority of
single judges on criminal trials, and he should, therefore, follow what he
considered the correct principle, that the counsel for the prosecution should
call what witnesses he thought proper, and that, by having had certain
witnesses examined before the grand jury whose names were on the back of the
indictment, he only impliedly undertook to have them in court for the prisoner
to examine them as his witnesses; for the prisoner, on seeing the names there,
might have abstained from subpoenaing them. He then said that he would follow
the course said to have been pursued by Campbell C.J. in a recent case, who
ruled that the prosecutor was not bound to call such a witness and that, if the
prisoner did so, the witness should be considered as his own. Upon counsel for
the prisoner saying that he believed that Creswell J. had acted differently,
Parke B. consulted with the latter and then said that Creswell J. had informed
him that he had always allowed the prosecutor to take his own course in such
circumstances, without compelling him to call the witness if he did not think
fit to do so, and that he entirely agreed with what Baron Parke proposed to do.










The judgment of Baron
Parke in Cassidy's case was delivered in March 1858. Section 11  of the Criminal
Code  declares that the criminal law of England as it existed on November
19, 1858, in so. far as it has not been repealed by any ordinance or act, still
having the force of law, of the colony of British Columbia, or the colony of
Vancouver Island, passed before the union of the said colonies, or by this Act
or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, and as altered, varied, modified
or affected by any such ordinance or Act, shall be the criminal law of the
Province of British Columbia. Prior to the enactment of the Code the
matter had been dealt with and the same date fixed by a proclamation issued
under the public seal of the colony of British Columbia by Governor Douglas on
November 19, 1858, and by an Ordinance to assimilate the general application of
English Law (30 Viet. o. 70) adopted by the Legislative Council of British
Columbia on March 6, 1867. In substantially the same form, the provisions of
the Ordinance are continued in the English Law Act, c. 111, R.S.B.C..
1948, section 2 . The matter we are considering has not been dealt with by
statute. If, therefore, what appears to

[Page 250]



have been considered
as a rule of practice prior to 1858 had become part of the common law of
England, the principle was as stated by Baron Alderson in R. v. Woodhead and
Baron Parke in R. v. Cassidy. That these decisions are to be regarded as
correctly stating the law of England as it was in 1858 is settled by the
decision of the Judicial Committee in Adel Muhammed v. Attorney-General for
Palestine[32] . Lord Thankerton, it will be noted, in delivering the
judgment of the Judicial Committee, said in part:



While their
Lordships agree that there was no obligation on the prosecution to tender these
witnesses, and, therefore, this contention of the present appellant fails,
their Lordships doubt whether the rule of practice as expressed by the Court of
Criminal Appeal sufficiently recognizes that the prosecutor has a discretion as
to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution, and the court will not
interfere with the exercise of that discretion, unless, perhaps, it can be
shown that the prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive.



While the case was an
appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal of Palestine and the conviction had
been made under the Criminal Code  Ordinance 1936 of that State, it is apparent
that the matter had not been dealt with by statute and that the law of
Palestine was in this respect the same as that of England.










In delivering the
judgment in the appeal taken by Lemay to the Court of Appeal from his
conviction, O'Halloran J.A. refers to two decisions of the courts of British
Columbia in which the matter was considered. In R. v. Sing [33], where the Crown did not call certain witnesses whose
names were on the back of the indictment, Macdonald J., referring to R. v.
Woodhead and R. v. Cassidy and to a more recent decision in R. v.
Wiggins [34], ruled that, unless the Crown saw fit to do so, it was
not necessary to call all of the witnesses whose names appeared. Counsel for
the prisoner contended that there were two other witnesses called at the
preliminary who should be called, in order that he might cross-examine them,
but the report of the matter does not indicate that any such order was made. In
R. v. Hop Lee[35], where the charge was selling narcotic drugs,



the Crown did not call
a Chinese witness who was in the employ of the police and who had been a
witness to the sale. The accused was convicted and appealed to the Court

[Page 251]



of Appeal and the
report shows that counsel for the Crown there took the attitude that the Crown
was under no obligation to call all, the witnesses and that this particular man
was a ""stool pigeon"" whose evidence could not be relied upon. The
Court unanimously dismissed the appeal and it may be noted that McDonald J.A.
(afterwards C.J.B.C.) quoted a length from the judgment of Lord Roche in Rex
v. Seneviratne, which has been so much discussed in the present matter,
including that passage where it is said that their Lordships could not,
speaking generally, approve of an idea that a prosecution must call witnesses
irrespective of considerations of number and of reliability, or that a
prosecution ought to discharge the functions both of prosecution and defence.










In the present matter
'the prisoner, who was tried before His Honour Judge Sargent in February 1951,
had known since the previous September that Bunyk would give evidence that he
had been accompanied to the restaurant by Powell and that Lowes was sitting in
the booth with him when the sale was made to the constable. The proceedings
following the committal were, by reason of the election of the appellant, by
way of speedy trial and there was thus no indictment upon which the names of
the witnesses proposed to be called would be endorsed and there is no
suggestion that any step was taken on the part of the prosecution which would
lead counsel for the accused to expect that they would be in court when the
matter came up for hearing and thus available to give evidence, as was the case
in R. v. Woodhead. Powell was an informer in the employ of the police
and, even had he been available, counsel for the Crown might well have decided
not to call him as a witness for the prosecution, as was done in the case of
Hop Lee. As to Lowes, the only information concerning him in the record is that
Constable Bunyk on re-examination said that he (Lowes) had no connection with
the matter ""as far as the R.C.M.P. is concerned"" and that he was not
an operator for the R.C.M.P. From the fact that Lowes was, according to Bunyk,
sitting at the table in the restaurant with Lemay when the latter produced the
finger-stall containing the small packages of the drug and made the sale to
Bunyk, it might be inferred that Lowes was a confederate of the latter, since, otherwise,
he would be unlikely to commit a criminal offence in his presence. If

[Page 252]



this be the proper
inference to draw, is it to be said that, as a matter of law, the Crown was
required to call Lowes as a witness for the prosecution and thus, assuming he
should join with Lemay in denying that any such trans-action had taken place,
assist 'a guilty person to escape? From a practical view point, if that was the
law, far from furthering the due administration of justice it would, in my
opinion, actively retard it. In the case of those engaged in the illicit drug
traffic, by working in pairs, the one making the sale would be assured at all
times of having a witness with him available, in the case of a prosecution, to
join in denying that anything of the kind had taken place and whom the Crown
would be bound to call. For the appellant, reliance is placed upon that portion
of the judgment of Lord Roche, hereinbefore referred to, where it was said that
the witnesses essential to the ""unfolding of the narrative on which the
prosecution is based"" must be called. This language must, however, be read
together with its context, as was done by McDonald J.A. in Hop Lee's case, and
so read it does not, in my opinion, sustain the contention of the appellant.
If, indeed, there were any difference between what was said by Lord Roche in
that case, which, as the report indicates, was obiter, and what was said
by Lord Thankerton in the case of Adel Muhammed (and I think there is
not), it is, in my opinion, the latter view that should be accepted.



The reasons for
judgment delivered by His Honour Judge Sargent satify me that he believed the
evidence of the witness Bunyk and that, had he not considered that he was bound
to acquit the accused by reason of the failure of the Crown to call Lowes as a
witness or account for his absence, he would have found the accused guilty.



As to the contention
that there was error in the judgment appealed from, in that the appellant was
found guilty and the case remitted to the trial judge for sentence, the matter
appears to me to be determined against the appellant by the decision of this
court in Rex v. Belyea[36]










I would dismiss this
appeal.

[Page 253]



CARTWRIGHT J.
(dissenting in part) :-This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia [37] dated March 22, 1951, setting aside the
judgment of acquittal of a charge of unlawfully selling a drug contrary to the
provisions of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act pronounced on the 27th
February, 1951, by His Honour Judge Sargent, ordering a conviction to be
entered and remitting the case to the trial judge to impose sentence.



The respondent was
first tried for the said offence before His Honour Judge Boyd and was convicted
on November 2, 19'50. On December 22, 1950, this conviction was set aside by
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[38]  (O'Halloran, Robertson and Sidney Smith,
JJ.A.) the last named learned Justice of Appeal dissenting, and a new trial was
directed.



The evidence mainly
relied on by the Crown at the trial with which we are concerned, before His
Honour Judge Sargent, was that of Constable Bunyk of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police who testified in chief that on the 21st of September, 1950, at about
9.15 a.m. accompanied by one Powell he approached the Malina 'Café in
Vancouver; that he looked through the window and saw the appellant, who was
already known to him, seated at a table in about the fifth booth on the west
side of the café; that he can not tell whether Powell also looked through the
window or saw the appellant; that he (Bunyk) entered the café alone and sat
down beside the appellant; that the appellant had in his hand a grey
finger-stall containing several capsules wrapped in silver paper and was trying
to remove an elastic band from around the top of the finger-stall; that he said
to the appellant-""Can I get one?"" and the appellant replied
""Yes""; that the appellant took one of the capsules from the
finger-stall and placed it on the table in front of Bunyk; that he (Bunyk)
picked it up and put it in his pocket and handed the appellant three dollars;
that he left the café and rejoined Powell about two doors east of the café. In
cross-examination and re-examination Bunyk testified that throughout the
trans-action which he had described in chief one Art Lowes was sitting in the booth
with the appellant and that Lowes was

[Page 254]



known to him (Bunyk).
The following questions and answers are found in the re-examination:










Q. How did Lowes
happen to be with LeMay at the time of this transaction?



A. I have no idea.



Q. Did the Art
Lowes who was with LeMay at the time of the transaction have any connection
with this case as far as the R.C.M.P. is concerned?



A. None whatever.



Q. Is Lowes an
operator for the R.C.M.P.? 



A. No, he is not.



The Crown proved that
the capsule purchased by Bunyk contained the drug mentioned in the charge.



The appellant gave
evidence. He denied having had anything to do with the matter; stated that he
had never seen Bunyk prior to the preliminary hearing; that he did not use
drugs and that he had never sold ,a drug to Bunyk or to anyone else. The
learned trial judge reserved judgment and later dismissed the charge.



In examining the
reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge it is necessary to know
something of the earlier trial of the appellant ,and of the reasons which moved
the Court of Appeal to set aside that conviction and direct a new trial.



The only substantial
differences between the evidence given at the first trial and that given at the
second which were suggested to be relevant to the determination of this appeal
appear to be: (i) At the first trial the evidence in the view of the Court of
Appeal indicated that Powell was in a position to see what occurred in the café
at the time Bunyk purchased the drug, while the effect of the evidence in this
regard at the second trial is summarized by the learned trial judge as follows:



I do not feel
that there is sufficient evidence before me upon which to make any finding,
either that Powell did or did not see the transaction between the accused and
Bunyk.










(ii) At the first
trial no evidence was given to shew why counsel for the Crown did not call
Powell as a witness, while at the second trial evidence was received to the
effect that he had disappeared and that inquiries as to his whereabouts were
unproductive of result. (It should be mentioned that Mr. Hall argued that the
evidence as to the making of these inquiries was inadmissible on the ground

[Page 255]



that it was hearsay,
but as, in my view, this evidence has no bearing on the result of the appeal I
do not deal with this question.) (iii) At the first trial there was no evidence
of the presence of Art Lowes at the time of the sale, indeed, Lowes was not mentioned
at all.



The reasons for
judgment of the Court of Appeal on the appeal from the conviction at the first
trial are set out in full in the reasons of O'Halloran J.A. in the present case
and are reported as LeMay (No. 1) in 100 C.C.C. pages 367 and 368. The question
whether that judgment was right in the result is not before us and I express no
opinion. That appeal was brought by the accused and under section 1014 (c) of
the Criminal Code  it was the duty of the Court of Appeal to allow the
appeal if of opinion that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice.



The learned judge
presiding at the second trial appears to me to have interpreted the reasons of
the Court of Appeal in LeMay (No. 1) as laying down as a rule of law that the
unexplained omission on the part of the Crown to call a witness shewn by the
evidence to have been in a position to give relevant and material evidence as
to the guilt or innocence of the accused necessitates an acquittal. The learned
trial judge appears to have inclined to the view that the failure to call
Powell was sufficiently explained. He then proceeds:



However, there is
one other piece of evidence which came out in cross-examination, namely, that a
,third person, Lowes was present at the sale to Bunyk. Evidence was led by the
Crown to show that Lowes was not connected with Bunyk or the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, but no explanation was given as to why he had not been called,
or what, if any, attempts were made to find him.



On these facts I
am faced with the principle laid down by the Court of Appeal in Rex v.
Lemay. In that case, Mr. Justice O'Halloran said in the course of his
judgment:



If all material
witnesses are not called by the prosecution, the defence is thereby deprived of
the opportunity for cross-examination, and to that extent an accused is denied
the right of full defence which our Courts have long recognized as essential to
a fair trial.



The judgment is
binding on me in. this case. Therefore, the motion to dismiss will be allowed
and the charge dismissed.



The right of appeal
against a judgment of acquittal is given to the Attorney-General by section
1013(4)  and is, of course, restricted to grounds of appeal which involve a
question of law alone.








[Page 256]



In my respectful
opinion the learned trial judge erred in law in instructing himself that there
is a rule of law such as he deduced from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in
LeMay (No. 1) viz: that the unexplained omis



sion on the part of the
Crown to call a witness shewn by the evidence to have been in a position to
give relevant and material evidence as to the guilt or innocence of the accused
necessitates an acquittal.



I do not propose to
examine the authorities at length. I think it sufficient to refer to the
judgment of their Lordships of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord
Thankerton in Adel Muhammed El Dabbah v. Attorney-General for Palestine[39] and
particularly at pages 167 to 169, where it is laid down that the Court will not
interfere with the exercise of the discretion of the prosecutor as to what
witnesses should be called for the prosecution unless, perhaps, it can be shewn
that the prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive. I find no
conflict between this judgment and that pronounced by Lord Roche, also speaking
for the Judicial Committee in Rex v. Seneviratne[40]). Counsel for the appellant laid emphasis on the
following passage at page 378:



Witnesses
essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the prosecution is based
must, of course, be called by the prosecution, whether in the result the effect
of their testimony is for or against the case for the prosecution.



It must be remembered
that Rex v. Seneviratne was a ease in which the accused had been
convicted of murder on purely circumstantial evidence. In the passage just
quoted it appears to me that Lord Roche Was referring to the duty which clearly
rests upon the prosecutor to place before the Court evidence of every material
circumstance known to the prosecution including, of course, those circumstances
which are favourable to the accused. It must also be remembered that Lord Roche
was not dealing with an argument of counsel for the accused that the prosecutor
had failed to call witnesses that he should have called, but with the reply of
counsel for the Crown to the argument of counsel for the defence that the
prosecutor had called a number of witnesses who gave irrelevant and
inadmissible evidence and whose evidence ought not to have been received.








[Page 257].



I wish to make it
perfectly clear that I do not intend to say anything which might be regarded as
lessening the duty which rests upon counsel for the Crown to bring for-ward
evidence of every material fact known to the prosecution whether favourable to
the accused or otherwise; nor do I intend to suggest that there may not be
cases in which the failure of the prosecutor to call a witness will cause the
tribunal of fact to come to the conclusion that it would be unsafe to convict.
The principle stated by Avory J. in Rex v. Harris[41]), that in a criminal trial where the liberty of a
subject is at stake, the sole object of the proceedings is to make certain that
justice should be done between the subject and the State, is firmly
established.



While it is the right
of the prosecutor to exercise his discretion to determine who the material
witnesses are, the failure on his part to place the whole of the story as known
to the prosecution before the tribunal of fact may well be ground for quashing
a conviction. Such a case is that of Edward Guerin [42]).



For the above reasons
I am of opinion that the learned trial judge erred in directing himself that he
was bound as a matter of law to acquit the appellant because of the fact that
the Crown did not call Art Lowes as a witness; and that the Court of Appeal
were right in deciding that the judgment of acquittal should be set aside.



As to the second
ground of appeal argued before us-that the notice of appeal to the Court of
Appeal was not in accordance with section 101'3(4) of the Criminal Code -I
agree with what has been said by my brother Kerwin.



It remains to consider
Mr. Hall's final argument that the Court of Appeal erred in directing a
conviction to be entered ,and that if the setting aside of the acquittal is
upheld a new trial should be directed.










We are bound by the
judgment of this Court in Rex v. Belyea [43], which decided that the wording of section 1013(5) of
the Criminal Code is apt to confer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal
in an appeal brought by the Attorney-General under section 1013(4)  not only to
set aside the judgment of acquittal and to direct a new trial but, in a proper
case, to direct a conviction to be entered, and

[Page 258]



it is irrelevant to inquire
whether, if the matter were res integra I would have found the wording
of the section sufficiently plain and unambiguous to effect so revolutionary a
change in the pre-existing law.



In my opinion the
power to direct that a conviction be entered after an acquittal by 'a trial
judge has been set aside can be exercised only if it appears to the Court of
Appeal from the judgment of the trial judge that he must have been satisfied of
facts which proved the accused guilty of the offence charged. In the case at
bar I do not think that this appears. It is quite true that the learned trial
judge says:



The accused went
into the box and categorically denied any sale of narcotics, and the testimony
of Bunyk in tote. He further states that he , did not know Lowes, at
least by name. These denials I do not accept, nor do I believe his testimony.



but he nowhere states
expressly, nor does it follow by irresistible inference from anything he does
say, that he accepts the evidence of Bunyk. He does not say that, but for the
supposed rule of law which he applied, he would have found the accused guilty.
He does not indicate that he is left without any reasonable doubt as to his
guilt. In the view he took of the law, it was, indeed, no more necessary for
the learned trial judge to express himself upon any of these vital matters than
it would have been fora jury to da so after being directed that in view of a
point of law taken by the defence they must return a verdict of ""not
guilty"". It is not, I think, sufficient that, from the reasons of the
learned trial judge, it should appear to the Court of Appeal in the highest
degree probable that he would have convicted but for his erroneous ruling on
the point of law; it must appear certain that he would have done so.



I would allow the
appeal to the extent of setting aside that part of the order of the Court of
Appeal which directs a conviction to be entered and would order a new trial.

Appeal
dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Receiving stolen goods—Recent
possession—Explanation by accused—""Might reasonably be true""—Proper direction—Report under section 1020 Cr. Code.

Appellant was convicted on a summary trial of receiving stolen
goods. It was established that the goods were stolen, that appellant at first
had denied possession and later explained this denial and also explained his
possession. In his reasons, the trial judge referred to the explanation of
denial (saying it was ""fantastic"") but did not refer to the
explanation of possession. The majority in the Court of Appeal affirmed the
conviction.

Held (Taschereau and Locke JJ. dissenting): That there
should be a new trial as the trial judge misdirected himself with respect to
the relevancy of the denial and had given to it an importance in relation to
the main issue of guilty knowledge not justified by the authorities.

Held: The omission of the trial judge to refer to the
explanation of possession is not remedied by his dealing with it in the report
made under section 1020, as that report is relevant only as to how he directed
himself at the trial.

Held: The statement in the report that the explanation
of possession ""was not a reasonable one"" wrongly placed the onus on
accused to prove the truth of this explanation, when the trial judge should
have directed himself not on the reasonableness of the explanation but whether
that explanation ""might reasonably be true"" in the particular
circumstances and therefore create in his mind a reasonable doubt.

Per Taschereau and Locke JJ. (dissenting): The remarks
made by the trial judge at the conclusion of the evidence do not show that he
had proceeded upon any wrong principle of law. There is no obligation upon a
County Court judge at the conclusion of such a hearing to make a complete statement
of his reasons for deciding the guilt or innocence of an accused.

Per Taschereau and Locke JJ.: Having been found in
possession, there was a presumption against appellant rebuttal by an
explanation which, if it raised a reasonable doubt, entitled him to be
acquitted; in the present case, the report shows that the trial judge did not
consider that the explanation was a reasonable one and was satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that appellant knew the goods were stolen at the time he received
them.

APPEAL from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1]

on a charge of receiving stolen goods.

appellant.

The CHIEF JUSTICE:—I agree with Estey J.



I do not
understand Chief Justice Duff's statement in Richler v. The King[2]
as meaning that if the trial judge does not believe the accused it is,
nevertheless, his duty to apply his mind to a consideration as to whether the
explanation given by the accused might reasonably be true. If the trial judge
does not believe the accused the result is that no explanation at all is left,
and the case would have to be decided on the well-known principle that
possession of recently stolen property is circumstantial evidence of guilt. In
the words of Blackburn J. in Regina v. Langmead[3]
:



If he (the
accused) fails to account for his possession satisfactorily he is reasonably
presumed to have come by it dishonestly.



But, in the
present case, on the issue of the accused's credibility, the learned County
Court judge, far from stating that he did not believe the accused, refers to
the fact that when the latter was ""asked by the police regarding these
goods he denied knowing anything about it"" and adds:



That, of
course, is a factor against him. He has been proved to have made a false
statement in one instance, which I am not saying that that detracts from his
evidence today but, it is a factor.



Thus the learned
trial judge states in his reasons that he did not come to the conclusion that
the false statement at first made to the police was, for him, a reason to
disbelieve the accused, but that such denial did not detract from the accused's
evidence before him at the trial. He says it was only a ""factor"".
Therefore, the explanation given by Ungaro of the circumstances under which he
came into possession of the goods was not discarded by the trial judge. The
explanation was not unreasonable in the








[Page 432]



premises and,
therefore, brought the case strictly within the application of Richler v.
The King supra as expressed by Chief Justice Duff.



It is manifest,
upon the reasons of the trial judge, that he did not apply his mind to the
question whether ""the explanation may reasonably be true, though he was
not convinced that it was true."" Indeed he did not refer to that
explanation at all, despite the fact that the reasonableness of the explanation
was the main point to be considered in the case.



I do not mean that
a trial judge is obliged in his judgment to give all the reasons which lead him
to the conclusion that an accused is guilty. Undoubtedly if he finds one valid
reason why he should reach that conclusion it is not necessary that he should
also give other reasons. It is imperative, however, that he should give a
decision upon all the points raised by the defence which might be of a nature
to bring about the acquittal of the accused. In the present case, discarding,
as he did, as ""fantastic"", the explanation of Ungaro's denial to the
police was insufficient to find the accused guilty. It was much more important
that the trial judge should have addressed himself to the main point in the
accused's defence, and which was the explanation of the circumstances which
accompanied the purchase from Seguin, the thief, of the goods stolen. As to
that the learned trial judge said absolutely nothing in his reasons, and,
reading them, a Court of Appeal is perfectly justified in holding that he
completely overlooked this point.



The judgment of
Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by



ESTEY J.:—The majority of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal
in British Columbia[4]
affirmed the conviction of the accused in the County Court Judges' Criminal
Court for receiving stolen property knowing it to have been stolen, contrary to
sec. 299 of the Criminal Code. Mr. Justice O'Halloran dissented on four
grounds:



(1) The learned
trial Judge did not take into judicial consideration the appellant's
explanation of his possession of the stolen articles;



(2) Rex v.
Bush[5],
does not apply to a case of this kind;

[Page 433]










(3) The learned
judge's report cannot cure No.[6]
thereof;



(4) There was no
finding upon credibility within the principle of White v. The King[7]
.



That the goods
were stolen, sold to the accused by a stranger below their value and found in
the possession of the accused were clearly established by the evidence. The
pertinent issue at the trial was, therefore, did the accused when he purchased
these goods know they were stolen?



The thief deposed
that he sold the goods to the accused but that he was neither asked for nor did
he himself volunteer any explanation as to how he obtained or why he was
selling the goods.



The policeman
deposed that when he first interviewed the accused the latter denied all
knowledge of the goods and then later, when he returned with a search warrant,
though the accused at first persisted in his denial, did then explain that he
purchased the goods from a man who said he had obtained them from bankrupt
stocks in Vancouver and was selling them in the Valley.



The accused,
giving evidence on his own behalf, admitted that he had purchased these goods
at low prices from the man who now admits he had stolen them, but who then
stated to the accused that these goods had been obtained from bankrupt stocks
in Vancouver and that he was selling them in the Valley. The accused also
explained that to the policeman he denied any knowledge of these goods because
of his previous dealings with him and that ""he was scared.""



The accused
therefore made two explanations, one as to his denial of possession and the
other that the thief told him the goods had been obtained legitimately.



I agree with all
of the learned Judges in the Court of Appeal[8]
that in the course of his reasons the learned trial judge refers only to the
accused's explanation of his denial to the police and makes no mention of his
evidence as to what the thief told him as to the source of the goods. The
learned trial judge refused to accept what he termed the ""fantastic""
explanation made by the accused for his denial to the policeman and therefore
that denial remained








[Page 434]



unexplained as
evidence of guilty knowledge and also relevant to the issue of the accused's
credibility. It did not otherwise here affect the main issue which, after the
""fantastic"" explanation was discarded, still remained to be determined.
The emphasis upon this denial without even mentioning the other explanation,
which was relevant to the main issue, and particularly the sequence of the
language, tends to support a conclusion that the unreasonable denial was given
a relevancy and an importance beyond which a proper direction would have
permitted and may have constituted the essential factor in finding the accused
guilty.



Upon the main
issue of guilty knowledge, in view of the explanation made by the accused and
denied by the thief that the latter stated he had obtained goods from bankrupt
stocks in Vancouver and that he was selling them in the Valley, the learned
trial judge should have instructed himself as in Richler v. The King[9]
, wherein Chief Justice Duff on behalf of the court stated the law to be as
follows (p. 103):



The question,
therefore, to which it was the duty of the learned trial judge to apply his
mind was not whether he was convinced that the explanation given was the true
explanation, but whether the explanation might reasonably be true; or, to put
it in other words, whether the Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the
learned trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the explanation of the
accused could not be accepted as a reasonable one and that he was guilty.



It was suggested
that the extract quoted from the Richler Case has been misunderstood and
our attention was directed to Rex v. Lockhart[10]
, where a passage is quoted from Rex v. Searle[11]
:



It is the
reasonableness of the explanation rather than the tribunal's belief in its
truth that should guide . . .



This language was
used in the Searle Case prior to, but its incorporation in the Lockhart
Case was subsequent to the Richler Case. With great respect, it is not
the reasonableness of the explanation but whether that explanation ""might
reasonably be true"" in the particular circumstances and therefore create
in the mind of the trial judge a reasonable doubt. It may well be that the
reasonableness

[Page 435]










of the explanation
may assist the learned judge in determining that issue. The Appellate Court in Rex
v. Lockhart, supra, stated:



…weighed in the light of all the
surrounding circumstances, the explanation given by the accused is not so
improbable that it might not reasonably be true.



If the Appellate
Court, with power to review and make findings of fact, concludes that the
statement of the accused ""might reasonably be true"" because of its
probability, then in the circumstances no fault can be found with the statement
and I think that is the meaning that the learned judges intended to convey.



The record in Richler
v. The King, supra, discloses that the accused was convicted by a
judge presiding under Part 18 of the Criminal Code (Speedy Trials of
Indictable Offences) of receiving stolen goods knowing them to have been
stolen. The accused gave an explanation as to which there was a conflict
between his evidence and that of the thief. One of the contentions on the part
of the accused before this Court was that the learned trial judge had rejected
his explanation because he did not believe it to be the true explanation. It
was in relation to this issue that the statement was made in the Richler
Case quoted above.



The reference in
the Richler Case to the decision in Rex v. Searle was merely to indicate
that the latter had followed Schama and not as expressing approval of
every phrase used therein by Chief Justice Harvey.



The approach to
the problem confronting the judge sitting alone or instructing the jury is all
important. The instruction in either case should be that the onus rests upon
the Crown throughout and that the judge sitting alone or the jury, after
considering the explanation made by the accused in relation to all the other
circumstances, must determine whether the proof establishes beyond a reasonable
doubt the guilt of the accused. A strict adherence to the determination of this
question will avoid many of the errors found in the cases. The language used
when other questions are considered, as to whether the explanation is the true
explanation or a reasonable or probable explanation, places an onus upon the
accused to establish one or the other of these as an affirmative fact. Such
would be contrary to the fundamental principle of law in which 

[Page 436]










the onus rests
upon the prosecution throughout to prove that the accused received the property
knowing it to have been stolen. It is true that the possibility of truth or its
reasonableness or probability may assist the judge in arriving at his answer to
the question of reasonable doubt. As Chief Justice Duff points out, if the
judge or jury conclude the explanation ""might reasonably be true,""
which is quite different from whether it is true, reasonable or probable, then
a reasonable doubt exists to which the accused is entitled to the benefit.



The judgment in
the Schama Case, quoted in part in the Richler Case was written
by Lord Chief Justice Reading. A few months prior thereto he had written the
judgment in the Curnock Case and had included a quotation from Regina
v. Langmead[12]
, in which Blackburn, J. stated:



If a party is
in possession of stolen property recently after the stealing, it lies on him to
account for his possession, and if he fails to account for it satisfactorily,
he is reasonably presumed to have come by it dishonestly; but it depends on the
surrounding circumstances whether he is guilty of receiving or stealing.



In the Curnock
Case[13]
Lord Chief Justice Reading refers to the Langmead Case and states:



In that case
it was decided that the burden of giving a reasonable explanation was on the
appellant.



These authorities,
particularly as read in relation to the Schama Case, leave no doubt but
that when Lord Chief Justice Reading refers to the burden in the Curnock
Case, and Blackburn, J. in the Langmead Case refers to the failure of
the accused to explain recent possession, they mean no more than that the
evidence of recent possession unexplained raises a prima facie case upon
which, if the accused does not adduce further evidence by way of explanation,
the jury may, not must, find the accused guilty. Whether, however, the
explanation is given or not the burden of proving the accused guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt remains throughout upon the prosecution. If, therefore, the
accused gives an explanation, as Ungaro did, then the trial judge must instruct
the jury, or himself if he is presiding without a jury, as in the Richler Case,
supra.



The learned trial
judge in the present case in referring to the ""fantastic"" explanation
made by the accused as to why he had made the false statement to the police








[Page 437]



states, ""This
explanation is not reasonable."" Then in his report under sec. 1020 he
states, ""The explanation given by the accused was not a reasonable
one"" and convicted him. On the assumption that he is in the latter
referring to the explanation as to the source of the goods, it is clear the
learned judge is directing his mind to whether the explanation is a reasonable
one. He therefore falls into the same error that those who consider the truth,
the reasonableness or the probability of the explanation rather than direct
their attention to whether that explanation as made by the accused, having
regard to all the circumstances, might reasonably be true and therefore set up
in the mind of the judge a reasonable doubt to which the accused is entitled to
the benefit.



The foregoing is
of particular importance where, as in the present case, the explanation, having
regard to the circumstances, is not unreasonable and contradicted only by the
thief. Reynolds[14]
; Rex v. Norris[15]
.



The learned trial
judge in the course of his reasons makes no mention of the explanation relative
to the source of the goods nor of any indication that he had so directed
himself. The Crown, under these circumstances, contends that it should be
assumed that the learned trial judge directed himself in accord with Richler
v. The King, supra. The learned Chief Justice, with whom Mr. Justice
Smith agreed, stated as follows:



In my view
this case falls within Rex v. Bush, (1938) 53 B.C. 252, and Rex
v. Miller, (1940) 55 B.C.R. 121 at 128. We must assume, in the absence
of anything appearing on the record to indicate otherwise, that the learned
trial Judge did apply the proper and relevant principles when considering the
explanation of possession given by the appellant.










In Rex v.
Bush[16]
, it was contended that a conviction upon the uncorroborated evidence of an
accomplice could not be supported upon appeal unless the trial judge had
specifically directed himself as to the danger of his so doing. The Court
refused to so hold and in this regard did not follow Rex v. Ambler[17]
, decided in the same year by the Alberta Appellate Division in which the
foregoing submission was accepted and the conviction quashed. This difference
of opinion is commented upon in Rex v. Tolhurst[18]
, and Rex v. Joseph[19]
. It is unnecessary to here

[Page 438]



resolve this
conflict as the authorities are unanimous that where the misdirection is
""manifest"" or the assigned reasons disclose self-misdirection the
conviction cannot stand. Rex v. Bush, supra; Rex v. Lockhart, supra;
Rex v. Nelson[20].



In his reasons,
with great respect, the learned trial judge discloses that he had misdirected
himself with respect to the relevancy of the denial and given to it an
importance in relation to the main issue not justified upon the authorities.
Moreover, a reading of the reasons as a whole suggests that he did not direct
himself as to the explanation of the source of the goods in relation to the
evidence as required in Richler v. The King, supra. There is at
least ""reason to doubt that he properly charged himself when forming his
conclusions upon the evidence"" as stated by Chief Justice Moss in Rex v.
Frank[21]
, which, with respect would appear to be an accurate statement of the
limitation in respect to the presumption upon which Rex v. Bush,
supra, was decided.



Moreover, it may
well be suggested that upon these reasons the learned judge directed himself to
the effect that the onus rested upon the accused to establish a reasonable
explanation.



The Crown contends
that whatever consequences might have resulted from the omission to refer to
the explanation as to the source of the goods given by the accused, it is
remedied by the contents of the report submitted by the learned trial judge
under sec. 1020 of the Criminal Code. His report concludes as follows:



I found as a
fact that the explanation given by accused was not a reasonable one and
convicted him. In reaching this conclusion I found that accused knew the goods
were stolen at the times he received them, that the Crown had satisfied the
onus placed upon it and that I had no reasonable doubt.



This report read
as a whole is another or supplementary statement of reasons supporting the
conviction in which the explanation of the source of the goods is as prominent
as the explanation of the denial in the reasons given at trial.










The question is,
how did the learned trial judge direct himself at trial? In his reasons at
trial emphasis is placed upon one of two explanations to the entire exclusion
of

[Page 439]



the other and that
other the more important to the main issue, and concludes ""this
explanation is not reasonable …I have no hesitation in finding that
the accused is guilty."" Then in his report under sec. 1020 he deals with
both explanations and then states ""that the explanation given by the
accused was not a reasonable one and convicted him."" It is impossible
under these circumstances for an Appellate Court to conclude that he has directed
himself within the meaning of Richler v. The King, supra. 



The appeal should
be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.



The dissenting
judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by



LOCKE, J.:—The appellant having elected for a speedy trial upon
three charges of receiving and having in his possession stolen goods, knowing
the same to be stolen, was tried by the County Court Judge for the County of
Yale and found guilty. The conviction was upheld by a judgment of the majority
of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[22]
and the appeal comes before us upon the grounds of dissent expressed in the
reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice O'Halloran.



The case raises
important questions relating to the due administration of the criminal law and
it is desirable, in my opinion, to set forth the circumstances in some detail.
Ungaro is a hotel keeper living in the city of Vernon, where he operates the
Kalamalka Hotel. He has a place of residence elsewhere in Vernon and on January
10, 1949, was there found to be in possession of a brown leather jacket, a
quantity of nylon silk stockings and a green and black check car robe, all of
which had recently been stolen by one Ernest Seguin. At the trial Seguin swore
that the car robe had been stolen by him from an automobile on the streets of
Vernon on December 31, 1948: the stockings formed part of a quantity stolen
from a parcel in the Canadian Pacific Railway station on January 3, 1949, and
the leather jacket from a store at Armstrong, a village some miles to the north
of Vernon, on the evening of January 7th. On the evening of the same day, he
said that he had gone to the Kalamalka Hotel where he had a room, taking two
leather jackets which he had stolen at Armstrong and








[Page 440]



put them in his
room, then went to the beer parlour and waited until it closed at 11.30 p.m.
and then took Ungaro to his room, showed him the two jackets and asked him if
he wanted to buy them. According to Seguin, Ungaro did not ask him where he had
got the jackets but agreed to buy them and gave him $4.00 for the two of them.
It is not clear from the evidence of this witness whether or not the
transactions in regard to the stockings and the car robe were on January 7th,
but the evidence as a whole would indicate that they were earlier on that day.
Seguin said as to these that he had gone to the beer parlour of the hotel carrying
thirteen pairs of the nylon stockings in a bag: that he had asked Ungaro if he
wanted to buy them and that the latter had said that he wanted some member of
his family to look them over and, having left apparently for this purpose,
returned and paid $7.00 as the purchase price. According to Seguin, he had
asked $8.00 but the appellant did not pay this amount. At the same time as he
made these sales, he claims to have told the appellant that he had two new
blankets and that at about 5 o'clock he brought them to the office of the hotel
and sold them to him for $6.00 or $7.00. As in the case of the stockings,
Seguin said that Ungaro made no enquiry as to where he had obtained them.



Constable Knox, a
corporal in the Provincial Police, said that on January 10, 1949, he spoke to
the appellant at the Kalamalka Hotel telling him that a green car robe had been
stolen from one Campbell and that the police had information it had been sold
to him. To this the appellant replied that he knew nothing about it. The
constable then asked him if he could help him to locate two leather jackets,
asking him if he had seen anyone around the hotel wearing them. To this Ungaro
replied that he knew nothing about the leather jackets. The constable further
asked the accused if he had been in Seguin's room in the hotel on the night of
January 7th and he said he had not. Search warrants were then issued, one for
the hotel and one for the home of the appellant and Corporal Knox went to the
hotel that night and again asked the appellant if he had any knowledge of the
green car robe or leather jackets or windbreakers and a quantity of stockings,
warning him that he did not have to say anything in reference to these 

[Page 441]










matters but that
if he did it could be used in evidence. After again denying any knowledge of
these things, Ungaro, according to the police officer, took him to his own home
in a car where two other constables were then executing the search warrants and
had already located the robe and the stockings. There the appellant produced a
leather jacket or windbreaker. On the way from the hotel to the house, Ungaro
had told the officer that the things for which the officer was searching had
been purchased by him from a man ""who told him he could get clothes of
like materials and articles from bankrupt houses in Vancouver.""



Ungaro who gave
evidence on his own behalf said that he had first met Seguin on the day he had
purchased the articles, that early in the afternoon of that day Seguin had come
in to the beer parlour and stopping at the counter had asked him if he wanted
some silk stockings and, when the appellant expressed his desire to see them,
produced them contained in individual envelopes in a box and asked how much he
(Ungaro) would pay for them. Ungaro says that he then asked Seguin where he got
them and that ""he said he got them from bankrupt houses in Vancouver and
sold them through the Valley."" According to the appellant, a large number
of people were in the beer parlour when this transaction took place and there
was no secrecy about it. On the evening of the same day, the appellant says
that Seguin came into the office in the lobby of the hotel with two blankets
which were wrapped as if they were new merchandise and offered to sell them.
One of these was the stolen car robe. Later that night, he says that Seguin
told him he had a jacket for sale in his room and he went up and bought it. He
admitted that he made no enquiry as to where Seguin had obtained either the car
robe or the jacket. As to the jacket, he said there was no conversation as to
the price other than that Seguin asked how much he would pay for it and he told
him he would give him $4.00 and did so. At the same time he said that Seguin
told him that he would bring a car full of blankets if Ungaro needed them for
the hotel and that he had told him that that would be all right. The appellant
admitted that he had told Corporal Knox that he did not know where the car robe
or leather jacket were but said that this was due to the fact that he had had
some previous 

[Page 442]










difficulty with
the constable and that he was afraid. While Seguin did not make clear in his
evidence the sequence in which the stockings, car robe and windbreaker were
sold by him to Ungaro, it is a proper inference, in my opinion, that they were
all sold on the same day and that the stockings were sold first. It should,
therefore, be taken that if, in truth, Ungaro asked the thief where he had
obtained the stockings it was at the first of the three transactions, so that
it may fairly be urged on behalf of the appellant that while he did not make
the same enquiry as to the other stolen articles he thought they had been obtained
by Seguin in the same way. The jacket was shown to be of the value of $16.00:
as to the stockings the appellant admitted on cross-examination that he knew
that he was getting a bargain in buying thirteen pairs of nylon stockings for
$7.00.



At the conclusion
of the evidence the learned County Court Judge found the accused guilty. His
remarks which prefaced the finding were as follows:—



In this case
it has been proved that the goods were stolen in each case and sold very much
below their value in each case, and it was also proved that they were found in
the possession of the accused.



When he was
asked by the police regarding these goods, he denied knowing anything about it,
that, of course, is a factor against him. He has been proved to have made a
false statement in one instance, which I am not saying that that detracts from
his evidence today, but, it is a factor, and I would say that when he had had
other dealings with the police that that would have taught him.



Now,
considering all the circumstances of the accused—Mr.
Ungaro—and the other circumstances of the
case, it is plain to my mind that this explanation is not reasonable. He says
he was scared. It is fantastic.



I have no
hesitation in finding that the accused is guilty.



It is, I think,
apparent that the explanation referred to in these remarks of the learned trial
judge was that given by the appellant for making the false statement to
Corporal Knox, to the effect that he knew nothing about the stolen goods. If he
had said nothing beyond announcing that he found the accused guilty of the
charges, it can scarcely be suggested that the convictions would have been open
to attack on any of the grounds now urged against them, since this would
involve asking the Appellate Court to assume that the judge had acted upon some
wrong principle of law. Here, apart from the statement that the goods had been
purchased at an undervalue, the judge 

[Page 443]










directed his
remarks to the question of Ungaro's credibility and in considering this
mentioned what he thought absurd the explanation given for having made the
false statement to the police officer. Why these remarks should be taken to
indicate that the trial judge had failed to consider the credibility of the
witnesses or, assuming that he believed that Seguin had made the statement
attributed to him by Ungaro as to where he had obtained the goods, whether that
was an explanation that might reasonably be true, I am unable to understand. If
the contention is that where a County Court Judge is conducting a speedy trial
and chooses to make any observations as to any aspect of the case before
announcing his judgment he must make a complete statement of all of the reasons
which have led him to his conclusion, the argument appears to me to be quite
without foundation. The learned judge was not required to give any reasons for
his judgment unless he chose to do so but, of course, if in stating the reasons
for his conclusions he showed that he had proceeded upon some wrong principle
of law, the conviction might be set aside, as might the verdict of a jury when
there has been misdirection. I find nothing of that nature in what was said by
the learned trial judge in the present case and if the matter is to be
considered divorced from the report made by him, as required by section 1020 of
the Criminal Code, the appeal, in my opinion, fails.



A more difficult
question arises, however, by reason of the terms of this report. It is, I
think, unfortunate that the section of the Code does not indicate more clearly
the nature of the report to be made. The judge is required to ""furnish to
the Court of Appeal in accordance with rules of Court a report giving his opinion
upon the case or upon any point arising in the case."" Whatever else may be
included in this language, the trial judge may properly, in my opinion, state,
if he wishes, his findings as to credibility if there are any such issues
involved and his other reasons for arriving at his conclusion. Of course, if he
has given reasons for his judgment at the time of announcing it, he cannot
properly give inconsistent reasons as had been done in Baron v. The
King[23]
. Such a report would be disregarded for the reasons indicated in the judgment

[Page 444]



of the Court
delivered by Chief Justice Anglin. The report and such reasons, if any, as have
been delivered are to be read together (Rex v. Reid[24]
). If the report should indicate that the trial judge has proceeded upon a
wrong principle, it is manifest that the judgment might properly be set aside,
even though reasons given at the time of delivering it indicated no such
irregularity.



In the report in
the present case the following appears:










Corporal Knox
gave evidence of interviewing the accused and receiving an explanation by
accused as to his possession of the stolen goods. But this explanation was not
given on the first interview. When first interviewed he denied that he had
received the goods. On being taken to his residence some hours later he made
the explanation which he gave in evidence at his trial. He said the accused
told him that he bought the goods from a man who was able to get quantities of
bankrupt stock from Vancouver. The thief in his evidence said that accused did
not ask him where he got the goods nor did he tell him anything at all as to
where he got them. Corporal Knox found the stolen goods in the possession of
accused. The accused gave evidence of his financial worth and the explanation
he had given Corporal Knox. On cross-examination he stated that previous to
coming to Vernon he had been owner of a store dealing in general merchandise.



I found as a
fact that the explanation given by accused was not a reasonable one and
convicted him. In reaching this conclusion I found that accused knew the goods
were stolen at the times he received them, that the Crown had satisfied the
onus placed upon it and that I had no reasonable doubt.



The
""explanation given by accused"" referred to in the concluding
paragraph, I think, clearly refers to the explanation given by Ungaro as to the
statement he said Seguin had made to him as to where he had obtained the goods.
The learned trial judge apparently did not note that the explanation made to
Corporal Knox by Ungaro was not quite the same as that stated by the latter in
his evidence at the trial, so that apparently the difference did not weigh with
him. It is, therefore, apparent that the trial judge had directed his attention
to the question as to whether the explanation given by the accused was a
reasonable one and had come to the conclusion it was not. I do not find that
this is inconsistent with anything said by the learned trial judge at the
conclusion of the trial. His comments there touched only upon the veracity of
Ungaro.



It is said for the
appellant that there was in the present ease no judicial determination of the
question as to

[Page 445]



whether the
explanation given by the accused as to how he obtained possession of the goods
might reasonably be true and reference is made to a passage from the judgment
of Duff, C.J. in Richler v. The King[25]
, reading as follows:



The question,
therefore, to which it was the duty of the learned trial judge to apply his
mind was not whether he was convinced that the explanation given was the true
explanation, but whether the explanation might reasonably be true; or, to put
it in other words, whether the Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the
learned trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the explanation of the
accused could not be accepted as a reasonable one and that he was guilty.










The statement
referred to follows a quotation from the judgment of Reading, L.C.J. in Rex v.
Schama and Abramovitch[26]
. The language there used has unfortunately given rise to some
misunderstanding: the passage in question, which is not stated in full in the
judgment in Richler's case, reads:—



Where the
prisoner is charged with receiving recently stolen property, when the
prosecution has proved the possession by the prisoner, and that the goods had
been recently stolen, the jury should be told that they may, not that they
must, in the absence of any reasonable explanation, find the prisoner guilty.
But if an explanation is given which may be true, it is for the jury to say on
the whole evidence whether the accused is guilty or not; that is to say, if the
jury think that the explanation may reasonably be true, though they are not
convinced that it is true, the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal, because
the Crown has not discharged the onus of proof imposed upon it of satisfying
the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the prisoner's guilt. That onus never
changes, it always rests on the prosecution. That is the law; the Court is not
pronouncing new law, but is merely restating it, and it is hoped that this
re-statement may be of assistance to those who preside at the trial of such
cases.



In Woolmington v.
Director of Public Prosecutions[27]
, Lord Sankey, L.C. delivering the judgment of the House of Lords and pointing
out that the burden of proving the guilt of the prisoner always rests upon the
prosecution and that there is no such burden laid on the prisoner to prove his
innocence, since it is sufficient for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt,
said in part:—



This is the
real result of the perplexing case of Rex v. Abramovitch, 11
C.A.R. 45, which lays down the same proposition, although perhaps in somewhat
involved language.



The language used
by Lord Reading has been interpreted otherwise than in the manner stated by
Lord Sankey. In

[Page 446]



Rex v. Searle[28]
, (a case which is mentioned without comment in Richler's case) Harvey,
C.J.A. said in part (493):



While recent
possession of stolen property is always considered as circumstantial evidence
of guilt it is evident that alone it could not, without violation of the
general principle, suffice for proof of guilt, because it is not inconsistent
with innocence and in Rex v. Schama it was pointed out that it
would be a wrong direction in law to tell the jury that, it being established
that recently stolen goods were in the prisoner's possession, they might
convict, if not satisfied of the truth of the explanation given by the
prisoner.



and again, after
referring to the fact that the police magistrate in his report to the court had
said in part: ""The accused endeavoured to give an explanation which I have
no hesitation in saying was false,"" said (495):—










In the
present case if the magistrate thought it was sufficient that he should
disbelieve the story told he was wrong in his law.



The learned Chief
Justice, judging from the passages quoted, appears to have overlooked the
statement of Blackburn, J. in Reg. v. Langmead[29]
, where he states the rule:—



If a party is
in possession of stolen property recently after the stealing, it lies on him to
account for his possession, and if he fails to account for it satisfactorily,
he is reasonably presumed to have come by it dishonestly;



a statement which,
as stated by Reading, L.C.J. in Thomas Henry Curnock[30]
, is the leading authority on the point. With respect, I think it was error to
say that possession of recently stolen property did not in itself give rise to
a presumption upon which there might be a conviction, in the absence of an
explanation. I think also the statement of the learned Chief Justice that if
the magistrate thought it was sufficient that he should disbelieve the story
told he was wrong in his law, is expressed too broadly and is not justified by
anything said in Schama's case. If by this the learned Chief Justice
meant that if the explanation given by the accused was considered by the
magistrate upon all of the evidence to be untrue and if, accordingly, it raised
no reasonable doubt in his mind of the guilt of the accused he was not entitled
to convict, I respectfully disagree. Where a person is found in possession of
recently

[Page 447]










stolen property,
the presumption referred to in Reg. v. Langmead arises, but this
may be rebutted by an explanation by the prisoner as to how it came into his
possession. This question was considered in Rex v. Gfeller[31]
, a judgment of the judicial committee on appeal from the West African Court of
Appeal. The accused in that case was charged with having received a quantity of
gin, knowing the same to have been stolen. The appellant, whose wife had an
interest in and was manageress of the Grand Hotel at Lagos, assisted her in the
buying of goods and spirits and some six months before the date of the offence
a Syrian named Jaffar had been introduced to him as a person who could get
supplies of alcohol and provisions and he had given him many orders which were
fulfilled from time to time. The appellant said that he believed that Jaffar
was getting the supplies from various shops and stores. On the day in question
Jaffar had told him that he could obtain a large quantity of gin at something
less than the current price and the appellant had agreed to take it and to pay
him a commission. Later in the day 156 bottles of gin were delivered to the
hotel, not packed in any way and being brought there in a taxicab. The
appellant said that he did not remember asking Jaffar where he had obtained the
gin and Jaffar deposed that he did not tell the appellant where he got the gin.
Sir George Rankin, in delivering the judgment of the court, said that the trial
judge had dealt with the charge of receiving on the basis of the law laid down
in the well known case of Rex v. Schama and quoted from the following
statement made in the charge to the jury:



Upon the
prosecution establishing that the accused were in possession of goods recently
stolen they may in the absence of any explanation by the accused of the way in
which the goods came into their possession which might reasonably be true find
him guilty, but that if an explanation were given which the jury think might
reasonably be true, and which is consistent with innocence although they were
not convinced of its truth the prisoners were entitled to be acquitted inasmuch
as the prosecution would have failed to discharge the duty cast upon it of
satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.



and, after
expressly approving this statement of the law and pointing out certain
circumstances which might cast

[Page 448]



doubt upon the
story of the accused that he had made no inquiry as to the source of the supply
or the immediate supplier, said:—



In this
summary every single fact might turn out to be free from suspicion, but if it
can be regarded as a broad statement of the main facts the appellant had
something to explain. The question must then be whether the explanation given
was such that the learned Judge ought to have directed himself or the jury to
the effect that, while they might or might not think it proved, they were
obliged to hold that it might reasonably be true and in this limited sense to
accept it. Their Lordships are unable so to hold. They think that it was open
to the jury to reject as untrue the story that the appellant asked Jaffar
nothing and was told nothing about the person from whom Jaffer got so
substantial a quantity of gin. The appellant did not have to prove his story
but if his story broke down the jury might convict. In other words the jury
might think that the explanation given was one which could not reasonably be
true, attributing a reticence or an incuriosity or a guilelessness to the
appellant beyond anything that could fairly be supposed. The verdict must in view
of the summing-up be taken in this sense. Whether it was right, may depend in
some measure on the habits of the people and the conditions of life in Lagos at
the time or on the mentality of the appellant—
whether he was shrewd or dull, quick or slow-witted, sharp or unsuspecting.
These matters are typical of the considerations which a jury may be taken to
appreciate, but the existence of a case to go to the jury did not depend upon
them.



The case gives a
practical illustration of the application of the principle in Reg. v.
Langmead and of the rule as to the burden of proof.










In Rex v.
Currell[32]
, Hewart, L.C.J. said that Schama's case decided no more than this, that
the burden of proof was always upon the prosecution. The passage in that case
which has caused so much difficulty was referred to by Lord Goddard, C.J. in Rex
v. Booth[33] :—



That is a
very hard-worked case, and, I think, very often misunderstood. It laid down no
new rule of law. All that it said was this: The onus is always on the
prosecution in a criminal case. In the case of receiving stolen goods, the
prosecution may discharge the onus by showing that the prisoner was in
possession of property recently stolen, and, in the absence of any explanation
given by the prisoner, the jury are entitled, on that evidence alone, to
convict. If, however, the prisoner gives in evidence a story which leaves the
jury in doubt, that is to say, creates a doubt in their minds whether he
received the goods feloniously, then they should acquit. Rex v. (Schama
and) Abramovitch merely means that if the story told by the prisoner has
caused doubt in the jury's mind, they should acquit him.



This statement and
that of Sir George Rankin in Gfeller's case are to be contrasted with
the above quoted language from Rex v. Searle and in other cases
in which what was

[Page 449]



said in that case
has been adopted. The quoted passage from the judgment of Duff, C.J. in Richler
v. The King above mentioned is to the same effect as the language
used by Goddard, L.C.J. in Booth's case. The burden is not upon the accused to
convince the judge or jury that he is innocent and if his explanation raises a
reasonable doubt he is entitled to be acquitted. The effect of the authorities
is accurately summarized in Phipson on Evidence (8th Ed. 33) as follows:—



Similarly, on
charges of stealing or receiving, proof of recent possession of the stolen
property by the accused, if unexplained or not reasonably explained, or if
though reasonably explained, the explanation is disbelieved, raises a
presumption of fact, though not of law, that he is the thief or receiver
according to the circumstances; and upon such unexplained, or not reasonably
explained, possession, or disbelieved explanation, the jury may (though not
must) find him guilty. It is not, however, for the accused to prove honest
dealing with the property, but for the prosecution to prove the reverse; and if
an explanation be given which the jury think may be true., though they are not
convinced that it is, they must acquit, for the main burden of proof (i.e.,
that of establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt) rests throughout upon the
prosecution, and in this case will not have been discharged.



In the present
case the learned trial judge, as stated in his report, did not consider that
the explanation given by the accused was a reasonable one and was satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the goods were stolen at the
time he received them.










I would
accordingly dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Appeals—Autre fois acquit—Autre
fois convict—Conviction for manslaughter on indictment for murder quashed for
misdirection but new trial not ordered nor an acquittal directed—Fresh
indictment preferred by Crown for manslaughter—Statutory authority given Court
of Appeal to direct acquittal or a new trial, mandatory—Failure of court to exercise
such authority precludes another trial under s. 873—The Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1927, c. 86, ss. 856, 878, 905-909, 951, 1014 (3).

The Criminal Code  provides:

“Section 1014 (3). Subject to the
special provisions contained in the following sections of this Part, when
the court of appeal allows an appeal against conviction it may

(a) quash the conviction and direct a
judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

(b) direct a new trial:

and in either case may make such other order
as justice requires.”

[Page 413]

Held: By the
majority of the court (Rinfret C.J., Kerwin and Taschereau JJ., dissenting),
that the exercise of the statutory authority given to the court of appeal under
s. 1014 (3) to direct an acquittal to be entered, or to direct a new trial, and
in either case to make such other order as justice requires, is not permissive
but mandatory. The right of appeal being such an exceptional right, all the
substantive and procedural provisions relating to it must be regarded as
exhaustive and exclusive and need not be expressly stated in the Statute. If
therefore the court of appeal fails to exercise its authority and refrains from
directing a new trial, another trial cannot be had by resorting to s. 873. The
powers under that section are not absolute and cannot obtain in all
circumstances. Like many others in the Code, they remain subject to
qualifications and restrictions implicitly and necessarily flowing from other
provisions in the same Act.

Per Rinfret
C.J. and Taschereau J., dissenting: The only competent authority in a case of
misdirection to order a new trial is the Court of Appeal, but failure of that
court to make such an order does not preclude the Crown from exercising its
rights to prefer a fresh bill of indictment under s. 873. The proceedings under
the fresh bill of indictment do not constitute a new trial, within the
meaning of s. 1014, they initiate a second trial, entirely independent
of the first on a new indictment. A “new trial” which alone the court of appeal
has the power to order in a criminal prosecution, is the re-examination of a
case on the same information or indictment. It supposes a
completed trial, which for some sufficient reason has ben set aside, so that
the issues may be litigated de novo. It is ordered so that the court may
have the opportunity to correct errors in the proceedings at the first trial.
Such is not the case here, and unless there are valid reasons to prevent the
Crown to initiate a second trial as it did, this appeal must fail. We
have to decide if the incomplete judgment of the Court of Appeal, is a bar to
the exercise by the Crown of its unquestionable power to prefer a bill of
indictment. A solid ground of defence would undoubtedly be a plea of autre
fois acquit or autre fois convict, but this cannot be successfully
argued. The appellant has neither been acquitted nor convicted, and it is only
in such cases that an accused may say, if he is brought to trial again on the
same charge, that he has been in “jeopardy” twice. Rex v. Ecker and Fry, 64
O.L.R. 1 at 3. The law does not allow that a man be tried a second time when he
has already been convicted, or exposed to be convicted, when he has already
been acquitted, but it does not forbid a second trial when the first did not
come to a legal conclusion. Only the pleas of autre fois acquit or autre
fois convict could be successfully raised by the appellant in the present
case, and as they both fail, the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin J.,
dissenting: The power given to the Court of Appeal under s. 1014 (3) is
permissive as indicated by the use of the word “may” and includes the power to
allow an appeal and set aside a conviction leaving the Crown free to prefer a
new and different indictment, if it sees fit. The powers of the Court of Appeal
are not circumscribed as are those of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England
and the decisions of that Court are, therefore, of no assistance on the point
under review. This appeal is to be decided under the provisions of the Criminal
Code , Rex v. O’Keefe, 15 N.S.W.L.R. 1; Rex v. Lee, 16 N.S.W.L.R. 6,

[Page 414]

distinguished; Rex v. Welch, [1948]
O.R. 884, Rex. v. Pascal, 95 C.C.C. 288, approved. Gudmundson v. The
King, 60 C.C.C., distinguished. Where an accused upon an indictment for
murder is convicted of manslaughter a court of appeal may properly under s.
1014 (3) allow the appeal and set aside such conviction. If it neither directs
a verdict of acquittal to be entered, nor directs a new trial, s. 873 (1) is
then wide enough to permit the preferring of a bill of indictment for
manslaughter. In provinces where there is no grand jury, subsequent sub‑sections of
s. 873 takes care of the situation. The second ground of the appeal, that, “the
accused was entitled in answer to the present indictment to the common law defence
that a man should not be put twice in jeopardy for the same matter,”—is not a
plea or defence, as the plea of autre fois acquit is grounded on the
maxim, that a man shall not be brought into danger of his life for one and the
same offence, more than once. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, 8th Ed. Vol.
II, c. 35, s. 1. As to the 3rd and 4th grounds of appeal—(a) “s. 902 (2)
was a bar to the present indictment;” (b) “the accused was entitled to
succeed on his plea of autre fois acquit pursuant to s. 907.”—The
meaning of s. 907, may be gathered from the use of the word “lawfully” in s.
906 (3), this expresses what has been well understood for many years viz. that
the defence of autre fois acquit applies only where the first trial has
been concluded by an adjudication: Reg. v. Charlesworth, 121 E.R. 786; Rex
v. Ecker, 64 O.L.R. 1. Here, the only adjudication was against the accused
for manslaughter and that adjudication was merely set aside by the first order
of the Court of Appeal. As to the first leg of s. 909 (2) “a previous
conviction or acquittal on an indictment for murder shall be a bar to a second
indictment for the same homicide charging it as manslaughter”. This must mean a
previous general conviction or acquittal.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing the appellant’s appeal from a conviction by a judge and jury for
manslaughter. The appellant had previously been indicted for murder and
convicted of manslaughter, but the conviction was quashed on appeal.[2]

G.A. Martin, K.C., and C.L. Dubbin, for
the appellant.

W.B. Common, K.C., and J.D. Bell, for the
respondent.

The dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice and
Taschereau J. was delivered by:—

TASCHEREAU J.:—The accused appellant was charged
with the murder of his wife and his trial took place at the City of
St. Thomas in the County of Elgin, in March, 1949. He was acquitted of the
charge of murder but convicted of manslaughter.

[Page 415]

The Court of Appeal of the Province of Ontario
allowed the appeal, and set aside the conviction for manslaughter on the ground
of misdirection by the trial judge. The Court however, did not direct a new
trial, but in their reasons for judgment, Laidlaw and Hogg JJ. both made the
emphatic statement that the accused was not acquitted. Mr. Justice
Henderson, who also heard the case, was of the opinion that the appeal should
be dismissed.

The reason for not ordering a new trial is that
on a count charging murder, no count charging any other offence may be joined. (Cr.
Code, sec. 856). The contention is that if the Court of Appeal had
ordered a new trial, although manslaughter is an included offence in a count of
murder, the accused would have had to face a second time an indictment charging
murder, an offence of which he had previously been acquitted. (Cr. Code 951,
para. 2). Vide: (Rex v. McDonald,[3];
Rex v. Anthony,[4]; Rex
v. Pascal,[5], Part
XX, 849).

A new indictment charging manslaughter was
therefore preferred by the Crown, and before Mr. Justice Schroeder and the
jury, the appellant pleaded “autrefois acquit”, submitting that the
Order of the Court of Appeal which did not direct a new trial, had the effect
of an acquittal. A jury having been sworn dismissed this contention of the
appellant following in this, the direction of the trial judge. The jury then
found the accused guilty of manslaughter and he was sentenced to 10 years in
penitentiary. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed his appeal.

It is now submitted before this Court that the
accused, having once before been tried for murder arising out of the same
homicide, and convicted of manslaughter, could not again be tried for
manslaughter, because that conviction had been set aside by the Court of
Appeal, which did not direct a new trial. It is claimed that he cannot be put
twice in “jeopardy” for the same matter, and that, under the provisions of
section 909, para. 2, his first acquittal on the indictment for murder, is
a bar to a second indictment for the same homicide charging it as manslaughter.

It is an elementary principle of criminal law
that when an accused charged of a crime has been convicted or acquitted by a
jury, he cannot be charged a second time for

[Page 416]

the same crime, and it is also clear that if on
a charge of murder, an accused is acquitted and not found guilty of
manslaughter, he cannot foe charged of manslaughter, because under the
provisions of section 907, para. 2, Cr. Code, the accused might on
the former trial have been convicted of manslaughter, and this is obviously a
bar to a new charge of manslaughter.

But in the present case, the accused was
acquitted of murder and found guilty of manslaughter, and the Court of Appeal,
although it found that there had been misdirection, did not acquit the
appellant. The Order of the Court was that the trial was not a fair one,
but the reasons of Laidlaw and Hogg JJ. clearly indicate that the accused was
not acquitted. The majority of the Court thought that a new trial could not be
ordered, but left it to the Crown to take the proper steps, if found opportune,
to bring the accused before the courts once more.

I had the advantage of reading the reasons for
judgment of my brother Fauteux, and I agree with him, that when the Court of
Appeal allows an appeal against a conviction, in a case like the one at bar, it
has only two alternatives. It may quash the conviction and direct a verdict of
acquittal, or direct a new trial, and it is only when one of these two courses
has been followed that it may make such other order as justice requires.
It is however imperative and not only permissive, that there
should be an acquittal or that a new trial should be directed.

I entertain no doubt that the Court of Appeal
had power by virtue of section 1014 (3) of the Cr. C., after
having quashed the conviction, to direct a new trial limited exclusively to the
charge of manslaughter. This would have clearly been an order authorized by the
concluding part of section 1014 (3) Cr. C.

But the Court of Appeal did not give such an
order, with the result, that the accused has neither been acquitted nor convicted,
and as there was no jurisdiction upon this Court to apply the proper remedy, it
necessarily follows that for all practical purposes the first indictment cannot
be acted upon any further. These proceedings have come to an end, as there can
be found nothing in the law to authorize the revival of this first trial.

[Page 417]

I fully concur in the view expressed that the
only competent authority, in a case of misdirection, to order a new trial
is the Court of Appeal, but I do not agree that the failure by the court to
make such an order had the effect of precluding the Crown from exercising its
rights to prefer a fresh bill of indictment under 873 Cr. C. as it has
been done in the present case.

The proceedings under the fresh bill of
indictment do not constitute a new trial, within the meaning of
section 1014; they initiated a second trial, entirely independent
of the first, on a new indictment. “A new trial” which alone the Court
of Appeal has the power to order in a criminal prosecution, is the re-examination
of a case on the same information or indictment. It supposes a
completed trial, which for some sufficient reason has been set aside, so that
the issues may be litigated de novo. It is ordered so that the court may
have an opportunity to correct errors in the proceedings at the first trial.

But such is not the case here, and unless there
are valid reasons to prevent the Crown to initiate a second trial as it
did, this appeal must fail. We have to decide if the incomplete judgment given
by the Court of Appeal, is a bar to the exercising by the Crown of its
unquestionable power to prefer a bill of indictment.

A solid ground of defence would undoubtedly be a
plea of “autrefois acquit” or “autrefois convict”, but I am
satisfied that this cannot be successfully argued. The appellant has neither
been acquitted nor convicted, and it is only in such cases that an accused may
say, if he is brought to trial again on the same charge, that he has been in
“jeopardy” twice. As Chief Justice Latchford said in Rex v. Ecker and Fry[6] (at page 3):—

This Court was of the opinion that “in
jeopardy twice”—the bis vexari of the legal maxim—has not the meaning of
subjection twice to a trial for the same offence except in cases where the
first trial has been concluded by an adjudication or judgment declaring the
accused acquitted or convicted. Not otherwise could the plea of autrefois
acquit or autrefois convict prevail.

I fully agree with this statement of the law,
and I may add that there are a great number of cases, where accused have
undergone second trials, when it was established that the plea of “autrefois
acquit” or “autrefois convict” could not be successfully raised. The
law does not allow that a

[Page 418]

man be tried a second time when he has already
been convicted, or exposed to be convicted, when he has already been legally
acquitted, but it does not forbid a second trial when the first did not come to
a legal conclusion.

Only the pleas of “autrefois acquit” or “autrefois
convict” could be successfully raised by the appellant in the present case,
and as they both fail, the appeal should be dismissed.

KERWIN J., dissenting:—By leave granted under
subsection 1  of section 1025  of the Criminal Code  as enacted
by section 42  of chapter 39 of the Statutes of 1948, the accused, Welch,
appeals against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his
appeal against his conviction for manslaughter. He had been previously
convicted of manslaughter after his; trial upon an indictment for murder,
arising from the death of the same person. The Court of Appeal allowed an
appeal against that conviction on the ground of misdirection of the jury by the
trial judge. The terms of that order and the reasons therefor are succinctly
set forth in the following extract from the reasons of the Chief Justice of
Ontario for the decision now appealed against:—

In his reasons for judgment in disposing of
the appeal, Mr. Justice Laidlaw, referring to the jury’s verdict of guilty
of manslaughter, said “That verdict, having been reached after such
misdirection, is not a valid conviction and must be set aside. At the same
time, I make it clear that the accused has not been acquitted of the offence of
manslaughter and I express no opinion as to what further proceedings the Crown
can or ought to take against the appellant in the particular circumstances.”
Mr. Justice Hogg, who concurred in setting aside the conviction said “I
agree with the observations made by my brother Laidlaw that the appellant has
not been acquitted of the crime of manslaughter.” Mr. Justice Henderson,
who, with Mr. Justice Laidlaw and Hogg, made up the Court that heard the
appeal, was of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. The formal
certificate of the Court’s order, after a recital, was in these words, “This Court
did order that the said appeal should be and the same was allowed and that the
said conviction should be and the same was vacated and set aside.”

A new indictment charging manslaughter was
preferred and upon his arraignment the accused pleaded autrefois acquit. On
the trial of that issue, the jury on the judge’s instruction found against the
accused. He thereupon pleaded not guilty but was convicted and sentenced to ten
years’ imprisonment. The appeal to the Court of Appeal

[Page 419]

followed, and, upon the affirmance of the
conviction, leave to appeal was granted. The points upon which that leave was
granted are set forth in the appellant’s factum as follows:—

(a) The accused having once before been
tried for murder, arising out of the same homicide, and convicted of
manslaughter, and whose conviction had been set aside by the Court of Appeal,
could not again be tried for manslaughter without a formal order of the Court
of Appeal directing a new trial.

(b) The accused was entitled in answer to
the present indictment to the common law defence that a man should not be put
twice in jeopardy for the same matter.

(c) Section 909 (2)  of the Criminal
Code  was a bar to the present indictment.

(d) The
accused was entitled to succeed on his plea of autrefois acquit pursuant
to Section 907  of the Criminal Code .

It was argued that the Court of Appeal had no
power merely to set aside the first conviction and that, therefore, its order
must be taken to be an acquittal of manslaughter under the indictment for
murder. That argument is based upon the provisions of subsection 3 of
section 1014:—

3. Subject to the special provisions
contained in the following sections of this Part, when the court of appeal
allows an appeal against conviction it may

(a) quash the conviction and direct a
judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

(b) direct a new trial;

and in either case may make such other
order as justice requires.

The contention is that when the Court of Appeal
allows an appeal against conviction it must either (1) formally allow the
appeal; and (2) quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of
acquittal to be entered; and (3) make such other order as justice requires; or
(1) formally allow the appeal; and (2) direct a new trial; and (3) make such
other order as justice requires. The argument amounts to a contention that if
the Court merely allows an appeal and quashes the conviction, the case falls
within the first alternative. To that argument I am unable to accede. While
some plausibility is lent to it by the expression “in either case”, the power
given to the Court of Appeal is permissive as is indicated by the use of the
word “may” and includes the power to allow an appeal and set aside a conviction
leaving the Crown free to prefer a new and different indictment, if it sees
fit.

[Page 420]

The powers of the Court of Appeal are not
circumscribed as are those of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England and the
decisions of that Court are, therefore, of no assistance on the point under
review.

On the reargument of this appeal before the full
Court, a discussion took place as to the powers exercised in England before
1904 of granting a writ of venire de novo and as to the powers of a
Court of Error. I have considered these arguments and the practice and law
prevailing as to each of these matters and particularly the two cases in New
South Wales referred to, Rex v. O’Keefe[7],
and Rex v. Lee[8], but
have been unable to gain any assistance from any of these in coming to a
conclusion. This appeal is to be decided under the provisions of the Criminal
Code .

In Rex v. Pascal[9], the Court of Appeal for British Columbia,
by a majority, followed the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal on the
first appeal by Welch to it[10].
Mr. Justice O’Halloran dissented and came to the conclusion that the
proper order to make in circumstances such as existed in that and the present
case was for the Court of Appeal, after setting aside the conviction, to direct
a new trial upon the charge of manslaughter, of which the accused had been convicted
and which conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal. That learned judge
realized the difficulty in coming to that conclusion in view of the provisions
of section 909 (2) of the Code and of the obstacle of arraigning an
accused on the same indictment, but concluded that because of his view as to
the meaning of 1014 (3), the Court of Appeal had the power to direct a new
trial on the charge of manslaughter since, while by section 856, to a
count in an indictment charging murder, no count charging any other offence
shall be joined, 951 (2) provides:—

2. On a count charging murder, if the
evidence proves manslaughter but does not prove murder, the jury may find the
accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, but shall not on that
count find the accused guilty of any other offence.

With respect I am unable to agree with
Mr. Justice O’Halloran’s view of section 1014 (3) and in my opinion
the proper course to follow is that adopted by the Ontario

[Page 421]

Court of Appeal and followed by the British
Columbia Court of Appeal. Section 873 (1) is then wide enough to permit
the preferring of a bill of indictment for manslaughter. In provinces where
there is no grand jury, subsequent subsections of section 873 take
care of the situation. It may be that in some cases, if an accused is charged
with murder and convicted of manslaughter and this conviction is set aside,
then, on a new indictment for manslaughter, the accused might be found by the
second jury not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of some included offence.
This, in my opinion, is not an objection either to what I deem is the proper
construction of section 1014 (3) or to the possibility of the accused
being found guilty of such included charge which would not have been possible
under the first indictment for murder. That possibility does not alter my view
as to the correct interpretation of section 1014 (3) nor, in the event of
that occurring, would it place an accused in double jeopardy since, on the
first indictment, he could not have been found guilty of such included charge.

It was also argued that what the Court of Appeal
did was based upon its former decisions in Rex v. MacDonald[11], and Rex v. Antony[12], and that these are in conflict with the
decision of this Court in Gudmondson v. The King[13]. As appears from an examination of the
case and factums in that case, the accused had asked that his conviction be
quashed and a new trial not ordered. This Court was not prepared to say that a
verdict of acquittal should be entered and, as the point now under discussion
was not argued or considered, the decision cannot be taken as being in conflict
with the orders made by the Court of Appeal in the cases mentioned.
Furthermore, a mere reading of the reasons for judgment on Welch’s first appeal
shows that the Court did not direct a verdict of acquittal. This disposes of
the first ground of appeal.

As to the second ground, it is sufficient to
point out that former jeopardy is not a plea or defence as the maxim nemo
debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa, or as it is sometimes expressed, nemo
debet bis puniri pro uno delicto, is merely the basis for the plea of autrefois
acquit. ‘“The plea of autrefois acquit is grounded on this maxim,

[Page 422]

that a man shall not be brought into danger of
his life for one and the same offence, more than once.” Hawkins’ Pleas of
the Crown, 8th ed. vol. II, c. 35, s. 1.

The third and fourth grounds may be considered
together. Sections 905 to 908 inclusive of the Code deal with the special
pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. The meaning and
effect of section 907 , referred to by the appellant, may be better
gathered from the use of the word “lawfully” in subsection 3 of
section 906.

3. In any plea of autrefois acquit or
autrefois convict it shall be sufficient for the accused to state that
he has been lawfully acquitted or convicted, as the case may be, of the offence
charged in the count or counts to which such plea is pleaded, indicating the
time and place of such acquittal, or conviction.

This expresses what has been well understood for
many years, viz., that the defence of autrefois acquit applies only
where the first trial has been concluded by an adjudication: Reg. v. Charlesworth[14], Rex v. Ecker[15]. Here, the only adjudication was against
the accused for manslaughter and that adjudication was merely set aside by the
first order of the Court of Appeal. Nor is the appellant assisted by the first
leg of subsection 2  of section 909 upon which he relies:—

A previous conviction or acquittal on an
indictment for murder shall be a bar to a second indictment for the same
homicide charging it as manslaughter.

This must mean a previous general conviction
or acquittal. The appellant does not, of course, contend that he was convicted
and, as the Chief Justice of Ontario points out, the suggestion that he was
acquitted is precisely the same contention advanced in support of the plea of autrefois
acquit.

The appeal must be dismissed.

The judgment of Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke,
Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:—

FAUTEUX
J.:—This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of
Ontario (Robertson C.J.O., Laidlaw and Roach JJ.A.)[16] dismissing, on March 17, 1949, an appeal
from the conviction of the appellant on a charge of manslaughter. The appellant
had been previously tried on an indictment for murder, arising

[Page 423]

from the death of the same person. Upon this
first trial, the jury brought in a verdict of manslaughter. An appeal from this
conviction was allowed under section 1014, on the ground of misdirection.
The formal certificate of the Court’s order, after a recital, is in these
words:—

This Court did order that the said appeal
should be and the same was allowed and that the said conviction should be and
the same was vacated and set aside.

In his reasons for judgment, Laidlaw J.A., with
reference to the jury’s verdict of “guilty of manslaughter” said:—

That verdict having been reached after such
misdirection is not a valid conviction and must be set aside. At the same time,
I make it clear that the accused has not been acquitted of the offence of
manslaughter and I express no opinion as to what further proceedings the Crown
can or ought to take against the appellant in the particular circumstances.

Concurring in setting aside the conviction, Hogg
J.A., said:—

I agree with the observations made by my
brother Laidlaw that the appellant has not been acquitted of the crime of
manslaughter.

Henderson J.A., expressed the opinion that the
appeal should be dismissed.

No direction was then made by the Court of
Appeal either to enter a judgment and verdict of acquittal or for a new trial.
The Court of Appeal did not in either respect exercise its authority under
section 1014 (3). Confronted with this situation, the Crown first moved to
appeal this judgment to this Court but, for reasons of jurisdiction, leave was
refused.

It was in these circumstances that a fresh bill
of indictment charging the appellant with manslaughter was subsequently
preferred by the Crown under the provisions of section 873  of the Criminal
Code . A true bill was found by the grand jury, the appellant was brought to
trial and, eventually, found guilty of the offence charged. His appeal against
this conviction was unanimously dismissed by the judgment now before us for
review.

As a new trial was not directed by the first
judgment of the Court of Appeal, it is manifest that the sub stratum of
jurisdiction for all the proceedings leading to the conviction of the appellant
and eventually to the present appeal can stem only from this fresh bill of
indictment preferred under section 873  in the circumstances above

[Page 424]

related. In the present instance, this question
of jurisdiction is twofold. Once the appeal is allowed for misdirection and the
conviction is quashed by the Court under section 1014, is the statutory
authority vested in the Court of Appeal to direct a verdict of acquittal to be
entered or to direct a new trial, mandatory or simply permissive? And if this
authority is mandatory, can another trial,—notwithstanding the express lack of
direction for a new trial by the judicial body solely empowered to make it,—be
had by resorting to the provisions of section 873 ?

Dealing with the first point. The relevant
provisions of section 1014 were enacted by Parliament in 1923 (13-14
George V, chap. 41, s. 9). They read:—

1014.

3. Subject to the special provisions
contained in the following sections of this Part, when the Court of appeal
allows an appeal against conviction it may

(a) quash the conviction and
direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or

(b) direct a new trial;

and in either case may make such other
order as justice requires.

The corresponding section of the English
Criminal Appeal Act of 1907 (7 Edward VII, c. 23, art. 4) from which the above
were taken reads:—

4. (2) Subject to the special provisions of
this Act, the Court of Criminal Appeal shall, if they allow an appeal against
conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal
to be entered.

The above juxtaposition of the two sets of
provisions makes it clear that the differences between them, as well as the
different manner in which each is set up, are attributable to the existence of
an alternative course,—a new trial,—which our Courts only, in a proper case,
must, as I propose to show, direct. That in the process of thus amending our
law, the indented letter (a) has been misplaced before the words “quash the
conviction and”, rather than being properly placed after them, cannot alter the
true meaning and the only possible construction of the section. For it is clear
that if the appeal against a conviction is allowed, of necessity the conviction
must be quashed. No other purpose can be served by the allowance of the appeal.
And it is then, and then only, that

[Page 425]

the occasion to exercise the further statutory
authority related to the election between a verdict of acquittal or a new
trial, may arise.

That there will be cases where the Court of
Appeal will not order one or other of the alternatives is certain. Thus a
conviction on an indictment signed by an unauthorized person cannot be
sustained and must be quashed. And in such a case, an order, either directing a
verdict of acquittal to be entered or a new trial, would be meaningless and
senseless. It cannot, therefore, be stated that this further authority is given
with respect to trials affected with such complete and fatal nullity. On that
point, our law is not at variance with the law in England even if, in the
relevant provisions of the latter, the word “shall” and not the word “may” is
used to govern the construction of the statutory power (Crane v. Director of
Public Prosecutions[17], Brodie
v. Rex[18].) In
like cases, the accused, having never been in peril of conviction, could not
subsequently if and when validly indicted, plead autrefois acquit on the
occasion of a trial which, if truly the second in fact, would be the first in
law.

However, in a case where the appeal is allowed
on ground of misdirection and the conviction is quashed, then necessarily
arises the occasion to exercise the further statutory authority. In England,
the Court of Appeal, having no power to direct a new trial, “shall” then direct
a verdict of acquittal to be entered,—”even though the prisoner be clearly
guilty”.—(Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th Ed., foot note page
500). In Canada, the Court of Appeal must equally exercise the further
statutory power and order, either a verdict of acquittal to be entered, or
direct a new trial. For, until such an order is made, there is still pending
before the Court of Appeal a valid indictment upon which there is no final
adjudication. And the very procedure to that end is provided for. The accused,
for one, has, in such circumstances and under our law, a clear and
unimpeachable right to such judicial pronouncement with respect to the election
between two courses,—one of which resulting in his acquittal,—on the sole and
very basis of the case as then under review and that, according to well
established principles.

[Page 426]

The expression “may” related to this further
authority of the Court is not and cannot, in the context of the
section read in the light of paramount principles of our criminal
procedure, be permissive. It is mandatory. In M’Dougall v. Patterson[19], it was held that

* * * when a statute confers
an authority to do a judicial act in a certain case, it is imperative on those
so authorized to exercise the authority, when the case arises and its exercise
is duly applied for by a party interested, and having the right to make the
application. For this reason, we are of the opinion that the word “may” is not
used to give a discretion but to confer a power upon the Court and Judges and
that the exercise of such power depends, not upon the discretion of the Court
or Judges, but upon the proof of the particular case out of which such power
arises.

That a like reasoning and meaning is to obtain
with respect to the same word “may” in the last member of this
section clearly stems from the context “and in either case may make such
order as justice requires”. For new and extraordinary would be a rule of
construction stating that, being empowered to make an order required by
justice, a Court of justice would be free to refrain from making it when the
occasion to do so arises. In Reg. v. Bishop of Oxford[20], it was held that

so long ago as the year 1693 it was decided
in the case of R. v. Barlow[21], that
when a statute authorizes the doing of a thing for the sake of justice or the
public good, the word “may” means “shall” and that rule has been acted upon to
the present time * * * .”

With like powers, or rather duties, I fail, I
must say with deference, to appreciate the alleged obstacles standing in the
way of the Court of Appeal to exercise its authority if, as suggested, the
majority judges wanted to direct a new trial only on this sole undisposed of
part of the indictment, that is, the lesser charge of manslaughter. Legal and
sufficient it would have been to direct a new trial on the offence of
manslaughter exclusively and to further order that the original indictment of murder
be, to that end, amended. Thus, on this new trial, the accused could only be
found guilty or not guilty of manslaughter. The language of the statute is
broad enough to embrace the authority to make such “other order”, if the
justice of the case suggests no other. And I know of no principles of law which
could have then been violated by such order. I must, therefore, conclude that

[Page 427]

the exercise of the statutory authority given to
the Court of Appeal, under section 1014 (3), to direct an acquittal to be
entered or to direct a new trial and in either case, to make such other order
as justice requires, is not permissive but mandatory.

Dealing with the second point, the Court having
failed to exercise its authority in the first appeal and having refrained from
directing a new trial by a judgment which, though substantially incomplete,
remains undisturbed, could another trial be had by resorting to
section 873 ?

It cannot be disputed that, had either one of
the courses, which the Court of Appeal was bound to direct, been directed, this
fresh bill of indictment would never have been preferred in fact. And never
then could, in law, a fresh bill of indictment be authorized under
section 873 . For on the one hand, the entry of a verdict of acquittal by
the Court of Appeal would have brought the case to an end.

On the other hand, had the Court of Appeal
directed a new trial, a fresh bill of indictment could no more, in law, have
been preferred. For such a course would have subjected the order of the Court
to the finding of a true bill by a grand jury. On a new trial being ordered,
the accused is not even required to plead. The trial proceeds immediately on
the original or amended indictment.

These considerations suffice to indicate that,
general and unrestricted as they may appear, the powers under section 873 
are not absolute and cannot obtain in all circumstances. Like many others in
the Code, they remain subject to qualifications and restrictions implicitly and
necessarily flowing from other provisions in the same Act.

Again, the relevant provisions of
section 873  were enacted much before those of section 1014 (3)
and then, not in relation to the latter. It cannot be contended, therefore,
that they were meant, when enacted, to provide a mode of redress,—left,
furthermore, at the discretion of the Attorney General or of the trial
Judge,—against the failure of a Court of Appeal,—a higher authority,—to comply
with the imperative provisions of section 1014 (3).

Our criminal law clearly prescribes two methods
leading to the holding of a trial. One is by way of an information

[Page 427]

or complaint and the other is by way (in the
province of Ontario) of a preferred bill of indictment. There are no other
methods.

Whatever be the method adopted if on a valid
indictment, the trial proceeds, with no defect as to jurisdiction, to verdict
and judgment, then the procedure provided by the law for the trial of that
issue,—or included issues,—is exhausted and the trial is brought to an end,
unless there is an appeal. The legislature does not, in addition to the above
procedure, contemplate or authorize,—either by laying another information or
complaint, or preferring another bill of indictment under 873,—such a thing as
the actual holding of another trial on the same issue, or included issues,
parallel to or independently of the first trial and irrespective of the
juridical consequences developing and rights accruing thereby to either of the
parties, according to law in the course of the latter. For such duplication
would, to say the least, render one course futile. So if a trial has been had
following the laying of an information, the provisions of section 873 
could have no application with respect to the issue, or included issues,
therein.

If, the case being concluded in first instance,
there is an appeal, for the same reason, like duplication of the procedure
cannot obtain. And the matter must, from then on, be considered in the light
only of the provisions relating to the appeal.

The right of appeal is an exceptional right. That
all the substantive and procedural provisions relating to it must be regarded
as exhaustive and exclusive, need not be expressly stated in the statute. That
necessarily flows from the exceptional nature of the right.

In Craies, on Statute Law, 4th Edition,
p. 236, it is stated:—

In Viner’s Abr. (m) the
following rule is laid down: “Every statute limiting anything to be in one
form, although it be spoke in the affirmative, yet includes in itself a
negative”; and in Bacon’s Abr. (n), the rule given is, that “if an
affirmative statute which is introductive of a new law direct a thing to be
done in a certain way, that thing shall not, even if there be no negative
words, be done in any other way.”

In Rex v. Howell[22], an accused person was charged with an
indictable offence and when brought before the Magistrate, the latter failed to
state to him the matters

[Page 429]

required by the then section 778,
subsection 2, of the Code. The accused having elected for a summary trial
was found guilty but on appeal the conviction was set aside. Cameron J.A. said
in part:—

Though ss. 2 of sec. 778  of the Criminal
Code , as it now stands, amended by 8 & 9, Ed. VII, c. 9, is
affirmative in form, it must be treated as implying a negative on the principle
that “if an affirmative statute which is introductive of a new law directs a
thing to be done in a certain way, that thing shall not, even if there be no
negative words, be done in any other way.”

It was for the Court of Appeal acting under the
powers vested in it by subsection 3 of section 1014 to direct a new
trial and not for counsel for the Crown, with the consent of the learned trial
judge, or for the Attorney-General, to decide that there should be a second
trial for the same offence. When the accused was arraigned before Mr. Justice
Schroeder, counsel on his behalf contended that, in the absence of an order for
a new trial made by the Court of Appeal, the accused could not be tried again
for the same offence. As for the reasons above expressed, I think a new trial
for the same offence was, in the absence of such an order, prohibited by the
statute, effect should have been given to this objection. I express no opinion
upon the other grounds of appeal which were argued before us.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and
direct the discharge of the accused.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Appeal from Summary Conviction
under an order adjudging sum of money to be paid into Court—Whether condition
precedent to right of appeal met, where appellant prior to date fixed for
payment, deposits with the Court the amount fixed by it to cover costs of
appeal.—The Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, s. 750(c), as amended by 1947,
c. 55, s. 23. Husband and Wife—Summary Proceedings for Maintenance—The
Deserted Wives’ and Children’s Maintenance Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 211.

[Page 382]

The Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1927, c.
36, s. 750(c) as enacted by S. of C., 1947, c. 55, s. 23, provides
that an appellant, if the appeal is from an order whereby a penalty or sum of
money is adjudged by a justice to be paid, shall within the time limited for
filing the notice of intention to appeal, in cases in which imprisonment in
default of payment is not directed, deposit with such justice an amount
sufficient to cover the sum so adjudged to be paid together with such further
sum as such justice deems sufficient to cover the costs of the appeal.

On Feb. 17, 1948 the deputy judge of the
Family Court of Toronto under the Deserted Wives’ and Children’s Maintenance
Act, R.S.O., 1937 C. 211, ordered the appellant to pay his wife at
the said Court the sum of $15 per week for her support, the first weekly
payment to be made on March 1. On Feb. 24 appellant paid to the Court the sum
of $25 as security for the costs of an appeal to the County Court, the amount
fixed by the Court as such security, and on Feb. 26 served and filed notice of
appeal.

His appeal to the County Court was dismissed
on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, and an application for an order of
mandamus made to the Supreme Court of Ontario was refused by a judge of that
court and on appeal by the Court of Appeal, on the ground that the provisions
of s. 750 (c) of the Criminal Code  were not complied with.

Held: that at
the time the appellant served and filed his notice of appeal there was no “sum
of money adjudged to be paid” and the appellant had done all that was required
of him in order to vest jurisdiction in the County Court.

Held: also,
that the appeal should be allowed, the order below set aside and a writ of
mandamus directed to be issued to the County Court to proceed with the hearing
of the appeal.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario dismissing appellant’s appeal from the judgment of Smiley J.
who refused appellant’s application for an order of mandamus directing a judge
of the County Court to hear appellant’s appeal from an order of the Toronto
Family Court directing payment by the appellant of the sum of $15 per week for
the support of his wife.

H. Gordon Webb in person for the
appellant.

No one appearing for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin, Rand
and Estey JJ. was delivered by:

KERWIN J.:—On February 17, 1948, the Deputy
Judge of the Family Court for the City of Toronto ordered Doctor Harry Gordon
Webb to pay his wife “at the Family Court, 90 Albert Street, in the City of
Toronto, the sum of $15 per week for the support of the wife of the said Dr.
Harry Gordon Webb, the first weekly payment to be made

[Page 383]

on the 1st day of March, 1948.” The order was
made under the Deserted Wives’ and Children’s Maintenance Act, R.S.O.
1937, chapter 211. On February 24, 1948, Webb paid to the Family Court $25 as
security for the costs of an appeal to the County Court (the amount fixed by
the Family Court Judge as such security), and on February 26 served and filed
notice of appeal. A County Court Judge decided, purporting to follow the
decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Johnson v. Johnson[1], that the County Court had no jurisdiction
to entertain the appeal.

Webb thereupon applied for an order of mandamus
directing a judge of the County Court to hear and determine the appeal. This
application was dismissed by Smiley J., as was also an appeal to the Court of
Appeal. In each case the application was refused on the ground that the
provisions of section 750 (c) of the Criminal Code  as enacted
by section 23 of chapter 55 of the Statutes of 1947 were not complied
with. Under the Deserted Wives’ and Children’s Maintenance Act, proceedings
are to be in accordance with the provisions of the Ontario Summary
Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 136. By virtue of section 13 of
the latter, an appeal is given in such a case as this to the County Court, and
by section 3, certain sections in Part XV of the Criminal Code , including
section 750 (c) shall apply mutatis mutandis.

The only decision besides the Johnson case
referred to, so far as we are aware, was Fink v. Fink[2] There Kellock J.A., with whom
Gillanders J.A. agreed, decided that the giving of a cheque was not a “deposit”
but he did not determine whether the “amount sufficient to cover the sum so
adjudged to be paid” would be the sum of $7, which was the only sum falling due
to be paid under the order of the magistrate at the time notice of appeal was
given, or the amount of all payments that would fall due under the order between
its date and the date upon which the notice of appeal was returnable, or some
other amount. I do not read the judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario as
deciding anything beyond that except to point out that it was generally
considered that compliance with section 750 (c) was a condition
precedent. At that time that part of section 750 (c), dealing with
appeals in cases where

[Page 384]

imprisonment in default of payment is not
directed, provided for the entering into a recognizance as an alternative to
the payment of the deposit. In the Johnson case, which was an
application for prohibition, which on appeal came before the Ontario Court of
Appeal, that Court granted an order of prohibition where cheques had been given
instead of cash. By that time the section as we now have it had been
enacted omitting the provision for entering into a recognizance.
Notwithstanding this alteration, the question left open in the Fink case
was still undecided.

It is now necessary to decide the precise point.
The matter does not lend itself to extended discussion but a reading of the
whole of section 750 (c) satisfies me that the appellant had done
all that was required of him in order to vest jurisdiction in the County Court.
Section 750 (c) as enacted in 1947 reads as follows:—

(c) the appellant, if the appeal is
from a conviction or order adjudging imprisonment, shall either remain in
custody until the holding of the court to which the appeal is given, or shall
within the time limited for filing a notice of intention to appeal, enter into
a recognizance in form 51 with two sufficient sureties before a county judge,
clerk of the peace or justice for the county in which such conviction or order
has been made, conditioned personally to appear at the said court and try such
appeal, and to abide the judgment of the court thereupon, and to pay such costs
as are awarded by the court or enter into a recognizance so conditioned and
make such cash deposit in lieu of sureties as the justice may determine; or if
the appeal is from a conviction or order whereby a penalty or sum of money is
adjudged to be paid, the appellant shall within the time limited for filing the
notice of intention to appeal, in cases in which imprisonment upon default of
payment is directed either remain in custody until the holding of the court to
which the appeal is given, or enter into a recognizance in form 51 with two
sufficient sureties as hereinbefore set out, or deposit with the justice making
the conviction or order an amount sufficient to cover the sum so adjudged to be
paid, together with such further amount as such justice deems sufficient to
cover the costs of the appeal; and, in cases in which imprisonment in
default of payment is not directed, deposit with such justice an amount
sufficient to cover the sum so adjudged to be paid, together with such further
amount as such justice deems sufficient to cover the costs of the appeal; and
upon such recognizance being entered into or deposit made the justice before
whom such recognizance is entered into or deposit made shall liberate such
person if in custody.

The part italicized deals with the situation
that confronted the present appellant. I cannot conceive that, if the appellant
had served and filed his notice of appeal and

[Page 385]

deposited the sum deemed sufficient by the
justice to cover the costs of the appeal, after one payment had fallen due
under the order, he would have been required to pay anything more than that one
payment. It might be, as in fact was the case, that some considerable time would
elapse before his appeal would be heard, and it could never have been the
intention that the appellant should make further deposits from time to time
until the appeal was heard. In my view, there was no
“sum * * * adjudged to be paid” at or before the time the
appellant served and filed his notice of appeal.

The appeal should be allowed, the order below
set aside and a writ of mandamus directed to be issued to the County Court to
proceed with the hearing of the appeal.

LOCKE J.:—I concur in the allowance of this
appeal and in the granting of a writ of mandamus.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Appeal—Special leave—Jurisdiction—Whether
statute giving new right of appeal is retrospective—New trial—Starting point of
proceedings—Same indictment—11-12 Geo. VI, c. 39, s. 42, enacting s. 1025 (1) 
Criminal Code .

Held: The amendment to section 1025 (1)  of the Criminal
Code , by which any person whose conviction on an indictable offence has
been affirmed by a Court of Appeal may, on any question of law, with special
leave granted by a judge, appeal to this Court, creates a new right of appeal
""which cannot be construed retrospectively so as to cover cases that arose
prior to the new legislation. (Boyer v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 89.)

[Page 353]

Held: Even though a new trial ordered by the Court of
Appeal was heard subsequent to the coming into force of the new legislation,
appellant cannot avail himself of the amendment as the new trial is not the
starting point of the proceedings—it is merely the reconsideration of the case
under the same indictment.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1, dismissing appellant's appeal from his
conviction on a murder charge.

Valmore Bienvenue, K.C. for the appellant.

H. M. Loranger, K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by:

Taschereau, J.:
In September, 1947, the appellant was originally charged with the murder of
Marcel Boileau, and was found guilty in October of the same year. In September,
1948, the Court of King's Bench of the Province of Quebec (Appeal Division)
ordered a new trial which was held in November, 1948, and a second verdict of
murder was rendered by the jury. The Court of King's Bench (Appeal Division) 2
unanimously confirmed this finding in September, 1949.

Special leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the
21st day of October, 1949.

The respondent now raises the question of jurisdiction of
this Court and submits that the appellant, having been charged in September,
1947, is still subject to the law, as it existed at that time, and that he may
not therefore, even with the permission of one judge, appeal to this Court on a
question of law, as he would have the undisputable right, if the proceedings
had originated on or after the 1st of November, 1948, date on which the new
amendment came into force.

There can be no doubt that special leave to appeal granted
by a judge of this Court under the new amendment, on a question of law, does
not confer jurisdiction on this Court, if otherwise this jurisdiction does not exist.
Special leave to appeal is a condition precedent to the right to appeal, but
the latter is subordinate to the power

[Page 354]

of this Court to hear such an appeal. Moreover, I may add
that when the application for special leave was heard, the question of
jurisdiction of the Court was not raised.

Before the 1st of November, 1948, an accused person,
convicted of a crime, and whose conviction had been unanimously affirmed
by a Court of Appeal, could appeal to this Court by special leave, under
section 1025  of the Criminal Code , only when the judgment of the Court of
Appeal came in conflict with the judgment of any other Court of Appeal in a
like case. However, since the 1st of November, 1948, the law has been amended,
and now any person convicted of an indictable offence, whose conviction has
been affirmed by a Court of Appeal, may on any question of law, with special
leave granted by one judge, appeal to this Court. The jurisdiction of the Court
has thus been considerably extended.

When the appellant made his application for special leave,
he did not attempt to show that the judgment of the Court of Appeal conflicted
with the judgment of another Court of Appeal in a like case, but merely raised
questions of law which he argued, were sufficient under the new 'amendment to
allow his appeal to be heard by the full Court.

It is now said on behalf of the respondent that section 1025 
of the Criminal Code  as amended, applies only to proceedings that originated
after the 1st of November, 1948, and that in view of the unanimous judgment
of the Court of Appeal, it was imperative upon the appellant in order to obtain
special leave, to show the existence of a conflict.

With this proposition, I entirely agree, as I do not think
that the new amendment which creates a new right of appeal, can be construed
retrospectively, so as to cover cases that arose prior to the legislation. It
is true that the new trial was heard in November, 1948, at a date subsequent to
the coming into force of the new legislation, but this new trial ordered by the
Court of Appeal under the provisions of section 1014  of the Criminal Code , is
not the starting point of the proceedings. It is merely the reconsideration of
a case previously heard in October, 1947, which in the opinion of the Court of Appeal
had

[Page 355]

been illegally tried. The indictment is the same, and the
new trial is therefore the continuation of proceedings started prior to the new
amendment.

In the case of Boyer v. The King 3,
the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal was given on the 30th of
November, 1948, one month after the coming into force of the amendment. On
behalf of the appellant it was argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeal,
being posterior to the new legislation, he could take advantage of the amendment
and obtain leave to appeal on a question of law. The Chief Justice 3,
after consultation with all the members of this Court, held that the amendment
created a new right of appeal, and had no retroactive effect. It therefore did
not apply to pending cases, which, in the view of the Chief Justice, continued
to be governed by the former ss. 1 of s. 1025 Cr. C.

I fail to see how the present case can be distinguished from
the Boyer case, and I would therefore quash the appeal for want of
jurisdiction.

Appeal quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Trial by
jury—Misdirection—Pleas of self-defence, provocation and drunkenness—Onus
probandi—Reasonable doubt—Evidence—Use of word “establish” in charge is
potentially dangerous—Intent in drunkenness—Criminal Code , ss. 263 , 1025(1) .

Appellant was convicted of murder after a
trial by jury. He had pleaded self-defence, provocation and drunkenness. His
appeal was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

Held: That,
when dealing with the specific pleas of self-defence and provocation, there was
a grave departure by the trial judge from the general principles he had laid
down in the opening part of his charge with respect to the burden of
proof—using the word “establish” in such a way that the jury could reasonably
understand it to mean “if it was established by the accused”—and that it was
never stated to the jury, either expressly or by clear implication, that, if
they were in doubt as to whether the act was provoked, it was their duty to
reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter.

Held: A
direction to the jury (which could reasonably be, by them, related to the
accused) that, if on one point they found the evidence of a witness to be
deliberately untrue, they could not believe him in any other particular, was a
misdirection of a most serious nature and tantamount to an encroachment upon
the right of full answer and defence.

Held: The
validity of the defence of drunkenness is dependent upon the proof that the
accused was at the time of the commission affected by drunkenness to the point
of being unable to form not any intent but the specific intent to commit the
crime charged.

Held: As it is
the duty of a juror to disagree if unable conscientiously to accept the views
of his colleagues, it is wrong in law to tell the jury that they “must agree
upon a verdict”.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—The appellant has been convicted, in
the city of Sudbury, in the province of Ontario, of the murder of the wife of
his first cousin, one Cécile Rainville. His appeal against such conviction was
unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal, the reasons for judgment reading:

After listening to the able and elaborate
argument addressed to us, we are quite unable to find anything in what has been
adduced, which would warrant our interfering with the verdict of the jury.
There is nothing to be gained by going over, one by one, the items so ably put
before us but the facts in this case are overwhelming and, in view of the
findings of the jury and the interpretation they put upon them, there is
nothing to be said. The appeal will be dismissed.

Pursuant to section 1025(1) , 1948  ch. 39 s.
42  of the Criminal Code , leave to appeal was granted on the following
points of law: (a) Misdirection of the trial judge as to the onus
probandi. (b) Lack of adequate direction with respect to the benefit
of reasonable doubt on every issue raised in the defence (Latour v. The King)[1] (c) Misdirection in the following
instructions to the jury:—

Should you come to the conclusion that any
witness came here and told something that he knew was not true, that would be
tantamount to perjury, and anybody who gives evidence that was not true in any
one instance, could not be believed in any other particular.

and (d) Failure of the trial judge
to relate to the specific crime charged, the rule as to intent applicable in
the defence of drunkenness.

At the close of the argument, the Court
indicating that reasons for judgment would be delivered later, allowed the
appeal, quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. In view of this order,
only such circumstances as are necessary for the determination of the questions
raised will be referred to.

On the morning of September 12, 1949, the
appellant, both hands badly bleeding, was seen by the landlady and another
tenant of the building, leaving the apartment occupied by his cousin Peter
Rainville, the deceased Cécile Rainville, and her brother Alexander Verdon.
After a short visit to the home of some friends, to wash his hands, he
immediately proceeded to the police department where he reported that he had
been in a fight and, from there, was escorted to the hospital where he received

[Page 21]

surgical attendance on his injuries on both
hands. Meanwhile, the police, alerted by the landlady of the apartment,
proceeded thereto and found the body of the deceased, bearing some thirty-two
wounds; they also found a knife admittedly identified as belonging to the
appellant and a coat the latter had borrowed from Verdon. As to what took place
in the apartment, there is no evidence but the incomplete account—hereinafter
referred to—given by the appellant himself; the evidence of the landlady and of
the other witness on the point throws little or no light. The theory submitted
to the jury by the Crown was that the appellant, well aware of the absence of
both his cousin and the brother of the victim, Verdon, visited the apartment
that morning for the purpose of having carnal knowledge with the victim and
that, when she refused, he stabbed her with his knife. It was conceded that
there is no evidence in point of an assault prompted by such motives nor of any
prior guilty passion by the accused towards the deceased. The evidence reveals
that the appellant, a bushman, was, on the day of the fatal occurrence,
terminating, in the city of Sudbury, a two-weeks vacation during which, being
on good terms with the Rainvilles, he freely visited their home. The appellant
testified that the return of the coat of Verdon was the purpose of his visit to
the apartment on the morning of the 12th. He relates the following facts:
Having delivered the coat, he was departing from the apartment when the
deceased invited him to stay, sit and talk and, eventually, proposed to have
sexual relations with him. He says that he then scolded her and told her he
knew much of how she was carrying on. It may be pointed out here that
independent evidence shows that the day before, the appellant having, in the
presence of Peter Rainville and Verdon, made unfavourable remarks as to the
moral conduct of the deceased, Verdon became angry and left the company in
protest. There is no evidence, however, that these remarks of the appellant were
subsequently conveyed to the victim either by her husband or by Verdon. The
appellant testified that the victim became incensed and told him he knew too
much of her past and that she then drew a knife from behind her back and went
to stab him. He protected

[Page 22]

himself with his hands but being then stabbed
and by reason of the combined effect of the stabbing, of pain in his hands and
of two weeks of persistent drinking, he said he lost his head and does not
recall what happened from that moment, up to time he was washing his hands at
the home of their common friends. He further denied having brought the knife
with him suggesting the deceased must have taken it from his room, which she
visited with him two days before, for the purpose of looking over some old
family pictures. The occurrence of this visit is corroborated by an independent
witness. On the basis of these facts, pleas of self‑defence, provocation
and drunkenness were advanced on behalf of the appellant, and with respect to
each of these pleas, the jurors received from the trial judge instructions
which must now be considered conjunctively with the above grounds of appeal.

Dealing with grounds (a) and (b).
The principles of the criminal law as to the onus probandi and the
benefit. of the doubt being substantially correlated in their application, the
merits of the first two grounds of appeal may, in this case, conveniently be
dealt with together.

In the early part of his charge the trial judge,
before entering upon the discussion of the facts of the case and before any
reference whatever to the pleas of self-defence, provocation and drunkenness,
and to the different verdicts resulting respectively therefrom, properly
charged the jury as to the burden of the proof and the benefit of the doubt, making
his own the following words of Viscount Sankey, Lord Chancellor, in Woolmington
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[2],
particularly at page 94:—

…it is not until the end of the evidence
that a verdict can properly be found and that at the end of the evidence, it is
not for the prisoner to establish his innocence but for the prosecution to
establish his guilt. Just as there is evidence on behalf of the prosecution, so
there may be evidence on behalf of the prisoner which may cause a doubt as to
his guilt. In either case, he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It must
be kept in mind that while the prosecution must prove the guilt of the
prisoner, there is no such burden laid upon the prisoner, to prove his
innocence and it is sufficient for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt. He is
not called upon to satisfy the jury of his innocence.

And he further instructed the jury with respect
to circumstantial evidence, giving them the rule formulated

[Page 23]

by Baron Alderson in the Hodge[3] case. No complaint is made as to the way in
which these matters were explained as general principles in criminal law. It is
complained, however, that, when he later dealt with the pleas of self-defence
and of provocation, there was a grave departure by the learned trial judge from
the general principles he had laid down with respect to the doubt, he entirely
failed throughout the charge to direct the attention of the jurors, in their
consideration of the plea of provocation, to their duty, to give the appellant
the benefit of the doubt, if any, in favour of the lesser charge of
manslaughter. The following excerpts from the charge, fairly representing the
substance of the directions with which the jury was left in the matter, are
impeached by the appellant as casting the burden of proof upon him and,
therefore, as being in violation of the principles laid down particularly in
the Woolmington case. As to the plea of self-defence, the trial judge said, at
page 407 of the record:

It is for the jury to say whether or not
the necessary facts have been established to warrant a plea of self-defence.

and as to the plea of provocation, he said, at
page 413:

The doctrine is that an unlawful killing
resulting from a deliberate act of violence is prima facie murder but
that, if it is established that the accused acted under a certain set of
conditions which were such as to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control, that presumption is rebutted and the killing is only
manslaughter.

On behalf of the respondent, it was pointed out
that the trial judge did not say “established by the accused” but simply
“established” and then argued that no burden was consequently cast upon the
appellant to prove the ingredients necessary to a plea of self-defence or to a
plea of provocation as had been explained to the jury. In the circumstances of
this case, the jury, in my view, could only, or to say the least, could
reasonably understand the directions as if it had, in effect, been said: “if it
was established by the accused” for, in this case, it is virtually only from
the account given by the appellant of what took place in the apartment between
himself and the victim, that the proof of the ingredients necessary to each
defence could, if at all, be found. It is on that view that the legality

[Page 24]

of the instructions must be considered for, in Bigaouette
v. The King[4], Duff
J., as he then was, delivering the judgment for the Court, stated at page 114:

The law, in our opinion, is correctly
stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart in Rex v. Gallagher, in
these words:

…it is not what the judge intended but what
his words as uttered would convey to the minds of the jury which is the
decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is
not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one meaning as
the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to take the
words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous
sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.

It is suggested, on behalf of the appellant,
that according to the dictionary, the word “establish” means “place beyond
dispute.” (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, page 684). On that
basis, it would then appear sufficient to substitute these words to the word
“establish” to conclude that, had it been said:

It is for the jury to say whether or not
the necessary facts have been placed beyond dispute by the accused to warrant a
plea of self-defence.

or had it been said with respect to the plea of
provocation:

…if it is placed beyond dispute by the
accused that he acted under a certain set of conditions…

the two directions, standing alone, would have
been palpably wrong, for the law only requires that the evidence in the
record,—introduced by the Crown or the defence, it does not matter—be
sufficient to raise in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt as to whether
the accused acted in self-defence or under provocation.

In judicial proceedings, the word “establish” is
correlated to the burden of the proof but to the burden of the proof not in the
sense of the necessity there may be for an accused in the course of the enquête
to introduce evidence in order to explain away the case being made by the
Crown, but in the sense of the permanent and paramount obligation there is for
the Crown, at the end and on the whole of the case, to have proved the guilt
beyond all reasonable doubt.

In Phipson on Evidence, 8th edition, it is
stated at page 27:

As applied to judicial proceedings, the
phrase “burden of proof” has two distinct and frequently confused meanings: (1)
The burden of proof as a matter of law and pleading—the burden, as it has been
called, of

[Page 25]

establishing a case, whether by preponderance of evidence, or beyond a reasonable doubt;
and (2) The burden of proof in the sense of introducing evidence… So in
criminal cases, even where the second, or the minor burden of introducing
evidence is cast upon or shifted to the accused, yet the major one of
satisfying the jury of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is always upon the
prosecution and never changes; and if, on the whole case, they have such a
doubt, the accused is entitled to the benefit of it and must be acquitted.

(Mancini v. D.P.P.[5]; Woolmington v.
D.P.P.[6])

It is clearly in relation to the “major burden,”
it may be pointed out, that the word “establish” is used by the House of Lords
in the above excerpt from the Woolmington case. In giving directions to the
jury, the use of the word “establish” in relation to the “minor burden” of introducing
evidence, is inadequate, confusing and potentially dangerous as it may,
depending upon the context or upon the whole charge and the nature and
circumstances of the case, lead the jury into error as to the plain nature of
their duty with respect to the most important feature of our criminal law, the
paramount and permanent burden of the Crown to establish ultimately its case
beyond all reasonable doubt. Not that it is suggested that the word “establish”
is necessarily improper in all cases. Used with proper qualifications, it has
been approved—it was pointed out on behalf of the respondent—in cases where a
defence of insanity is raised. This, however, affords no argument in favour of
the latter’s views, for a defence of insanity is a matter altogether different.
In point of fact, the legislature affirms a legal but rebuttable presumption
against insanity. Section 18  of the Criminal Code  reads:

Everyone shall be presumed to be sane at
the time of doing or omitting to do any act until the contrary is proved.

So, there is, in such case, an obligation to
prove or to establish the defence of insanity even if it needs not be
established beyond reasonable doubt but only to the reasonable satisfaction of
the jury. Smythe v. The King[7] No
similar presumption exists, however, with respect to the issue of self-defence
or of provocation. Even the presumption that everyone intends the natural
consequences of his act needs, in order to be rebutted, no more than evidence
sufficient to raise a doubt as to the intent.

[Page 26]

Nor is it suggested that the use of the word
“establish” will always be fatal in all of the cases, for each case must be
judged upon its merits but confusion in words naturally, if not always, leads
to confusion in ideas and, in the matter, to confusion as to what the duty is.
Again and in the case at bar, all what was said as to the burden of proof and
the benefit of reasonable doubt, has been indicated above and was further
stated as general principles in the earlier part of a charge, necessarily
lengthy, and long before any reference was made to the special issues raised in
the case, to the necessary ingredients thereof and to the different verdicts
resulting therefrom. But the principle that, if the jurors were in doubt as to
whether the act was provoked, it was their duty to reduce the offence from
murder to manslaughter, was never stated to them, either expressly or by clear
implication. In the case of Prince[8],
the accused, charged with murder, pleaded provocation. This was the only issue.
A verdict of murder was set aside for the following reasons stated by the Lord
Chancellor at page 64:

We think that the summing up was
insufficient. Having regard to the absence of any direction that, if upon the
review of all the evidence, the jury were left in reasonable doubt whether,
even if the appellant’s explanation were not accepted, the act was provoked,
the appellant was entitled to be acquitted of the charge of murder.

In the case of Manchuk v. The King[9], the jury, while considering the case,
returned to Court to request the assistance of the learned trial judge upon a
difficulty which they explained in the following question:

In order to reduce a murder charge to a
manslaughter charge, is it necessary to establish the fact that the person
killed committed the act of provocation?

At page 349, Sir Lyman Duff, the then Chief
Justice of Canada, said:

The terms in which the question is
expressed manifest plainly that (notwithstanding some observations in the
earlier part of the charge as to the burden resting upon the Crown up to the
end of the case of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt) they had
fallen into the very natural error of thinking that, in proving the killing,
the Crown had disposed of the presumption of the prisoner’s innocence and that
they must find the prisoner guilty of murder unless he affirmatively
established to their satisfaction provocation in the pertinent sense. The
interrogatory of the jury ought to have been answered in such a manner as to
remove this error from their minds. It ought to have been made clear to them

[Page 27]

that in the last resort the prisoner could
not properly be convicted of murder if, as the result of the evidence as a
whole, they were in reasonable doubt whether or not he was guilty of that
crime.

On behalf of the respondent, it was suggested
that the general instructions given at the beginning of the charge of the trial
judge as to the burden of proof and the doubt, were sufficient and that, as
stated at page 280 in the Mancini case (supra):

There is no reason to repeat to the jury
the warning as to the reasonable doubt again and again, provided that the
direction is plainly given.

It is not difficult to agree with this sentence
from the Mancini case but it is impossible to accept that in the charge
made in the present case, the pertinent direction was “plainly given.”

In Albert Edward Lewis[10], Avory J., as he then was, stated, at page
34:

The importance of telling the jury that the
burden has not shifted is probably greater in a case in which the defendant
goes into the witness-box (as the appellant did) than in one in which he does
not. The jury not unnaturally are apt to think that when a defendant goes into
the witness-box the burden is on him to satisfy them of his innocence.

While one may regard the direction given with
respect to the plea of self-defence as being less questionable because of the
general instructions given in the earlier part of the charge, the impeached
direction with respect to the plea of provocation, coupled with the complete lack
of direction as to the duty of the jury to give the benefit of the doubt, if
any, on the issue raised and bring a verdict of manslaughter instead of a
verdict of murder, leaves no doubt, I must say with deference, that the jury
was not instructed according to law. For, once properly instructed as to what
the law recognizes as ingredients of self-defence or of provocation, the
accurate question for the jury is not whether the accused has established such
ingredients but whether the evidence indicates them. And they, then,
must be directed that, should they find affirmatively or be left in doubt on
the question put to them, the accused is entitled, in the case of self-defence
to a complete acquittal, or in the case of provocation to an acquittal of the
major offence of murder.

[Page 28]

To dispose of the third ground of appeal, it
could be sufficient to say that, with natural fairness, it was conceded by
Mr. Common, K.C., of counsel for respondent, that it was a misdirection to
instruct the jury in the following terms:

Should you come to the conclusion
that any witness came here and told something that he knew was not true, that
would be tantamount to perjury and anybody who gives evidence that was not true
in any one instance, could not be believed in any other particular.

And it could be added that this Court, in Deacon
v. The King[11],
approved, at page 536, what had been said by Riddell J. in Rex v.
Kadeshewitz[12], when
the latter refused to accept, as being the law in Canada, the following
summarized statement, the substance of which is attributed to Lord C.J. Hewart
in the case of Harris[13]:

If a witness is proved to have made a
statement, though unsworn, in distinct conflict with his evidence on oath, the
proper direction to the jury is that his testimony is negligible and that their
verdict should be found on the rest of the evidence.

But to examine in a proper light the ultimate
suggestion made on behalf of the respondent that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice resulted from such misdirection, it is further
convenient to consider two questions: To which of the witnesses heard in this
case such warning could reasonably be related by the jury, and, then, what
effect, if any, it could have in the result.

The facts, proof of which was material to the
case of the Crown—the death of Cécile Rainville, the violent cause of her
death, and the author of her death,—were not virtually disputed by the
appellant who, by his very testimony, assumed the task of explaining them away
in relating what, according to him, took place between him and the victim in
the apartment, for the advancement of his pleas of self-defence and of
provocation. At the end of the case, the veracity and the credibility of the
accused really turned to be the crucial point for the decision of the case.
Naturally, any direction in this respect would particularly and at first be
applied to the accused by the jury. Furthermore, the manner and the measure in
which the appellant was cross-examined by the Crown Attorney and the trial
judge as well, could only add to the natural disposition of

[Page 29]

the jury to relate the misdirection to him.
Throughout the address to the jury, the instructions with respect to the
special pleas advanced, were either prefaced or followed by the caveat:
“If you accept the testimony of the accused.” To be virtually directed that, if
on one point, they found his evidence deliberately untrue, they could not
believe him in any other particular, was a misdirection of a most serious
nature as, if the condition on which rested the direction was found to exist,
the jury was then instructed to entirely disregard the whole defence. To say
that, in the circumstances of this case, this misdirection could be tantamount
to an encroachment upon the right of full answer and defence, would not be an
extravagant statement.

Dealing now with the last ground of appeal. It
was formulated orally in the course of the argument, leave to do so being then
granted upon the consent of the Crown, and in view of the importance of the
case. The grievance is that the trial judge failed to direct the jury that the
validity of the defence of drunkenness is dependent upon the proof that the
accused was, at the time of the commission, affected by drunkenness to the
point of being unable to form not any intent but the specific intent to commit
the crime charged in this case, the crime of murder, or the lesser crime of
manslaughter. As it turned out, this ground was not pressed in the argument
and, for this reason, its merits will not be discussed. As there will be a new
trial, it may be pertinent to say a word on this and another matter. The rules
of law for determining the validity of the defence of drunkenness have been
stated, in the two following propositions, by Lord Birkenhead, in the Beard case[14]:

That evidence of drunkenness which renders
the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to
constitute the crime should be taken into consideration with the other facts
proved in order to determine whether or not he had this intent.

That evidence of drunkenness falling short
of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to
constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by
drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut the
presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.

Reference may equally be had to the judgment of
this Court in MacAskill v. The King[15]

[Page 30]

The other matter in which comments may be added,
although the point was not raised by the appellant, is related to the following
direction given to the jury:

This is an important case and you must
agree upon a verdict. This means that you must be unanimous.

This is all that was said on the subject. If one
of the jurors could have reasonably understood from this direction—and it may
be open to such construction—that there was an obligation to agree upon a
verdict, the direction would be bad in law. For it is not only the right but
the duty of a juror to disagree if, after full and sincere consideration of the
facts of the case, in the light of the directions received on the law, he is
unable conscientiously to accept, after honest discussion with his colleagues,
the views of the latter. To render a verdict, the jurors must be unanimous but
this does not mean that they are obliged to agree, but that only a unanimity of
views shall constitute a verdict bringing the case to an end. The obligation is
not to agree but to co-operate honestly in the study of the facts of a case for
its proper determination according to law.

In the presence of the misdirections above
discussed, their gravity and their combined effect, I am unable to say that the
respondent has affirmatively shown that there was, in the result, no
substantial wrong and that justice was done according to law. And, as above
indicated, the judgment rendered by the Court is that the appeal is allowed,
the verdict of murder is quashed and a new trial is ordered.

Appeal allowed and new trial directed.

PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

alibi—Charge of trial judge—Misdirection—Non-direction—Substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice—Accomplices—Corroboration—Evidence of previous
offence—Interference with cross-examination of witness—Circumstantial

[Page 116]

Appellant was convicted of murder after a trial by jury. His
defence was a denial that he had anything whatever to do with the matter. He
testified that he was not at the time of the crime with the deceased and the
three principal Crown witnesses as to all of whom it was open to the jury to
take the view that they were accomplices. His conviction was affirmed by the
Court of Appeal.

The Crown called evidence in rebuttal of statements made by a
defence witness in the absence of the accused contradictory of the evidence
given by such witness at the trial. The trial judge not only failed to explain
to the jury that such contradictory statements were no evidence of the truth of
the facts stated therein and must be considered solely as a test of the
credibility of such witness, but gave the jury to understand that this rebuttal
evidence had evidentiary value and might be regarded by them as corroborative
of the evidence of the alleged accomplices. Held: that, particularly as
the trial judge had failed to instruct the jury that before evidence can be
considered as corroborative within the meaning of the rule requiring
corroboration of the evidence of an accomplice it must tend to show not merely
that the crime has been committed but that the accused committed it, such
non-direction and misdirection were fatal to the validity of the conviction.

Crown counsel, in re-examination of a Crown witness, for the
purpose of refreshing his memory, read to him from the transcript of his
evidence at the preliminary hearing and elicited evidence that the accused had
made a threat to such witness including a statement which would lead the jury
to believe that on another occasion the accused had shot another person. Held:
that, following the King v. Laurin, the deposition should not
have been read to the jury. Quaere: Whether under the circumstances of
the case it was permissible to refer to the deposition at all for the purpose
of refreshing the memory of the witness. Held further: The trial judge
should have, in this case, in the exercise of his discretion, excluded any
evidence indicating that the accused had made such a statement, even though it
might have been relevant to the issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused
as being evidence of an attempt, on his part, to suppress evidence by means of
a threat; it was wrong to admit such evidence which was highly prejudicial to
the accused and in this case had substantially no probative value. (Noor Mohamed
v. The King; Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions and Rex
v. Shellaker referred to.)

Held: The interference of the trial judge with the
right of the defence to cross-examine one of the Crown witnesses (a right
included in the right to make full answer and defence any improper interference
with which will usually be a sufficient ground for quashing a conviction) did
not produce any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the particular
circumstances of this case.

Held: The trial judge should have followed the usual
practice of indicating to the jury the nature of the evidence in support of the
alibi and telling them that, even if they were not satisfied that the alibi had
been proved, if the evidence in support of it raised in their minds a
reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt it was their duty to acquit him.

[Page 117]

Held: The evidence as to the cause of the victim's
death being largely circumstantial, the jury should have been directed that if
and in so far as they based their verdict on circumstantial evidence, they must
be satisfied not only that those circumstances were consistent with the accused
having killed him but also that they were inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion. (Hodge's case).

Held: Once this Court reaches the conclusion, on one or
more of the points properly before it, that there has been error in law below,
it is unfettered in deciding what order should be made by the views expressed
in the Court of Appeal. Therefore, the argument, that the jurisdiction of this
Court in criminal matters being limited to questions of law and the court
appealed from having held that notwithstanding certain errors in law at the
trial there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, such decision
being on a question of fact or of mixed fact and law cannot be reviewed in this
Court, is not entitled to prevail. (Brooks v. The King; Stein v. The
King; Bouliane v. The King; Schmidt v. The King and Chapdelaine
v. The King referred to).

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming the conviction of the
appellant, before a judge and jury, upon a charge of murder.

Alexandre Chevalier K.C. for the appellant.

Noel Dorion K.C. and Paul Miquelon K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Cartwright J.:—This
is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal
Side) of the Province of Quebec 2, pronounced on the 5th day of May, 1950,
affirming the conviction of the appellant upon a charge of having ""in the
night of the 14th to the 15th of June, 1947, with other persons to be later
identified killed and murdered Gérard Beaumont.""

The appeal comes before us pursuant to an order of the Chief
Justice of Canada pronounced on the 22nd day of May, 1950, granting the
appellant leave to appeal to this court upon the following grounds.

(1) the illegal admission of
rebuttal evidence presented by the Crown for the alleged sole purpose of
attacking the credibility of a defence witness by the name of Hamel which
rebuttal evidence consisted in proof

[Page 118]

(2) of a previous
contradictory statement made by the witness Hamel in the presence of the
witnesses heard in rebuttal but in the absence of the Petitioner Lizotte and
the failure of the trial Judge to explain to the jury that the said rebuttal
evidence purported to be exclusively a test of the credibility of the said
witness Hamel;

(3) the illegal admission of
a proof of character of the Petitioner by the illegal introduction in the
evidence before the jury in the re-examination of one Maurice Légaré of the
previous testimony of the said Légaré at the time of the preliminary inquiry
which previous testimony included an alleged statement in the presence of
Légaré that the Petitioner had previously shot somebody and would be able to shoot
another person;

(4) the illegal refusal by
the trial Judge to permit the defence to establish in cross-examination of Mrs.
René Boivin that the said Mrs. Boivin was greatly antagonistic and entertained
a spirit of revenge against the Petitioner on account of previous testimonies
by the Petitioner against the husband of the said Mrs. René Boivin in some
previous cases before the Courts;

(5) the error of the trial
judge in his instructions to the jury in failing to direct the jury relatively
to the proof of alibi and to the question of the benefit of the doubt in
connection with this defence; the failure of the trial judge to instruct the
jury that the Crown must prove not only the death of the victim but also that
the death was caused by the accused considering that there was in the record no
scientific or other proof of the cause of the death of Gérard Beaumont nor of
the time of the said death;

(6) the failure of the trial
judge to instruct the jury concerning circumstantial evidence that such
evidence must be not only compatible with the guilt of the accused but
incompatible with his innocence.

On the afternoon of the 14th of June, 1947, Gérard Beaumont
left his home at St-Gérard Majella intending to

[Page 119]

go by motor-bus to the City of Quebec. He was apparently in
good health and sober and was said to have with him approximately forty dollars
(although it is questionable whether this last mentioned fact was proved by any
admissible evidence).

On the 22nd of June, 1947, the body of Beaumont was observed
floating in the St. Charles River. A police officer brought the body to shore
by the use of a rope with a brick attached. An inquest was held but there was
no autopsy. The body was already in a state of decomposition. It was said by
some of the witnesses that there were marks on the forehead of the victim. A
verdict of death from drowning was returned.

The accused was arrested on the 26th of November, 1948. At
the trial three witnesses Maurice Légaré, Vallières and Demers gave evidence
which, while containing a number of contradictions and differences in matters
of detail some of which were of importance and some comparatively trifling, was
in substantial agreement as to the broad outlines of the case on which the
Crown relied. Their account of what occurred may be briefly summarized as
follows.

At about eleven o'clock on the night of June 14, Légaré,
Vallières and Demers were together at or near a bus terminal in Quebec and were
intending to return to the place where they were working at Rivière aux Pins in
a taxicab driven by the accused. Before leaving they were in conversation with
the deceased who said that he was going to return by motor-bus. The witness,
Demers, says that Lizotte said to the deceased ""No, you are coming with
us"" and that some of them pushed him into the car. Before leaving the city
they stopped and Légaré purchased some bottles of beer. They continued on their
way and drank some of the beer in the car. Légaré and the deceased, who had had
some of the beer, began to quarrel in the back seat. Légaré said to the chauffeur ""arrête, on va
régler cette affaire-là drette icitte."" The chauffeur stopped the car.
Légaré and Beaumont got out of the car. After getting out of the car, Légaré struck
Beaumont twice on the head with a beer bottle and Vallières struck him once.
Beaumont fell to the ground. At this point Lizotte is said

[Page 120]

to have taken hold of Beaumont by the hair, to have struck
him in the face with his fist and to have kicked him in the face. Thereafter
they put Beaumont back into the rear of the car on the floor and drove off.
They stopped for gasoline at the garage of Jean Paul Hamel at St. Gérard Majella
as to which a little more must be said later. They then drove away towards
Quebec on the Forty Arpents road. At a lonely spot on the road they stopped,
took Beaumont out of the car, removed most of his clothes, took the money from
his pockets and divided it amongst the accused, Légaré and Vallières. They put
Beaumont back in the car and then drove on and stopped at a point near le
Remous des Hirondelles on the St. Charles River. At that point Lizotte is said
by Vallières and Légaré to have taken Beaumont out of the car and dragged him
away in the direction of the river. According to Demers, Lizotte, Vallières and
Légaré went away together dragging Beaumont. Demers says that at this point
Lizotte threatened him, seizing his neck-tie and saying:—""Ti-blond, tu vas
m'aider ou tu vas mourir, la même chose, toi aussi."" Demers says that he
refused to help saying he would as soon die. Demers says that when Lizotte, Vallières
and Légaré returned to the car he asked what they had done with Beaumont and
Lizotte, Vallières and Légaré said ""Il recommence à revenir, il reprend sa
connaissance, que le diable l'emporte, il s'en ira tout seul.""

It is said that the accused then drove Demers, Vallières and
Légaré back to Rivière aux Pins arriving there about five o'clock in the
morning of Sunday, June 15, 1947.

It should be emphasized that the above is but a brief
outline of the main points of the narrative contained in the evidence of
Demers, Vallières and Légaré which occupied some hundreds of pages in the
transcript and contains numerous points of disagreement.

Evidence was given that the accused did not return the taxi
to the garage of his employer, Madame Boivin, until the morning of Tuesday,
June 17, that the seat-covers had then been removed and that he told Madame
Boivin that he had removed them because they were dirty.

[Page 121]

The theory of the Crown appears to be that Beaumont died
either as a result of the blows or kicks given to him by the accused or as a
result of being thrown into the river by the accused, while still alive.

The defence is a denial that the accused had anything
whatever to do with the matter. The accused gave evidence. He denied that he
was with the deceased, Légaré, Vallières or Deniers on the night in question.
Evidence was given by his wife and sister-in-law that during the month of June,
1947, which his wife claims to remember particularly well as she was expecting
shortly to give birth to a child, the accused never came into the house at
night later than midnight except on one occasion when he came in about 1.30
a.m.

The first ground of appeal arises out of the following
circumstances. The Crown witnesses, Demers, Vallières and Légaré stated, as
mentioned above, that after Beaumont had been assaulted and put back in the
car, the accused remarked that he was running short of gasoline and drove to
the gas station of Jean Paul Hamel at St-Gérard Majella, arriving there about 2
o'clock in the morning, that they had to wait for some little time but that
Hamel finally came down and supplied them with some gasoline and that they then
drove away.

Hamel, called as a witness for the defence, testified that
he had not served Lizotte or any of the other witnesses with gasoline on the
night in question and he went on to state that he could not have done so as he
did not have any gasoline during the month of June. The defence called one
Georges Marchand an employee of the Imperial Oil Company who said that that
company had supplied Hamel with gasoline in the years 1946 and 1947 but had not
supplied him with any between the month of November, 1946 and the 28th of June,
1947. In rebuttal the Crown called one Joseph Légaré who testified that he had
supplied Hamel with a total of ten barrels of gasoline containing 45 gallons
each during the months of May, June and July, 1947. During Hamel's
cross-examination he was asked whether he had had conversations with three
persons, Eugene Rivard, Lucien Falardeau and Germaine Beaumont (Dame Lucien
Falardeau). Hamel was asked

[Page 122]

whether Rivard had come to his store during the night of the
15th to the 16th of June, 1947, apparently to get gasoline. Hamel said that
Rivard had come but he thought that it was on the previous night, and that he
had not come out nor had he served Rivard with gasoline. He
was asked whether he had had a conversation with Rivard a few days later and
had said to him, referring to his visit just mentioned: ""Pourquoi
ne vous êtes-vous pas nommé des fois qu'il vient des jeunes qui sont chauds,
qui font du train"", ou encore ""généralement des jeunes qui viennent
la nuit, qui font du train la nuit, j'aime pas ça et si vous vous étiez nommé
je vous aurais servi?"" Hamel admitted having had a conversation with
Rivard but denied having used the words mentioned. Rivard was called in
rebuttal and deposed to the words which Hamel had used. These words were
identical in meaning with those which had been put to Hamel. Hamel was asked in
cross-examination whether on or about the 22nd of June, 1947, he had had a
conversation with Lucien Falardeau, a brother-in-law of Beaumont. The question was then put to him: ""Quelques
jours après la disparition de
celui qui serait son beau-frère aujourd'hui et que vous lui aviez dit ceci:
'Que vous trouviez ça effrayant la disparition de Gérard et que dans la nuit du
samedi, samedi en question, 14 au 15 juin, vous lui aviez dit qu'il était venu en
taxi, vous aviez cru entendre sa voix, la voix de Gérard?'"" Hamel denied having made any such statement. In
rebuttal Lucien Falardeau deposed that Hamel had said to him speaking of the
deceased: ""Bien, il m'a dit qu'il était allé un char, le samedi qu'il
était disparu, pour avoir du gaz. Il m'a dit 'J'ai cru que Gérard
était dans le char'."" Hamel was asked in
cross-examination in regard to Madame Falardeau: ""Vous
rappelez-vous d'avoir rencontré madame Falardeau, soeur de Gérard Beaumont, quelques jours après la disparition
de son frère ou après qu'on eut repêché le cadavre de son frère et lui avoir
dit à peu près ceci, et je cite: 'Je sais qu'il est venu un taxi pour avoir du
gaz, ils ont cogné pas mal longtemps, j'ai vu que c'était des gars pour avoir
du gaz, j'ai descendu et je leur en ai donné. J'ai jeté un coup d'oeil dans la
machine puis j'ai cru que c'était Gérard qui était étendu dans le fond de la
machine, à terre,

[Page 123]

puis il y avait du sang dans la machine, oui
ou non avez-vous dit ça à madame Falardeau?"" Hamel denied having
made such a statement. Madame Falardeau was called in rebuttal but just after
the question had been put to her as to what statement, if any, Hamel had made
to her, she was apparently taken ill in the witness box and the matter was not
further pursued.

What is here complained of is not the admission of the
evidence of Rivard and Lucien Falardeau as to the statements contradictory of
his evidence in chief which Hamel is alleged to have made to them or of the
evidence of the witness Jos. Légaré as to his having
supplied gasoline to Hamel but the complete failure of the learned trial judge
to explain to the jury that the contradictory statements were no evidence of
the truth of the facts stated therein but must be considered solely as a test
of the credibility of the witness Hamel. It is said that, far from giving the
jury any such direction, the learned judge gave them to understand that this
rebuttal evidence had evidentiary value and could be regarded by the jury as
corroboration of the evidence of Légaré and Vallières,
whose evidence was clearly that of accomplices, and of the evidence of
Demers as to which the learned trial judge, in my opinion properly, told the
jury that they might or might not regard it as being that of an accomplice.

At the conclusion of the argument, in the absence of the
jury, upon the trial judge ruling that the rebuttal evidence tendered was
admissible, counsel for the accused said: ""Alors, je croirais qu'il faudrait que vous expliquiez aux jurés qu'il s'agit de la crédibilité
d'Hamel,"" and the learned trial judge replied ""Absolument.""
and after a short further discussion counsel for the accused said, ""Je
fais application pour que, dans votre charge, vous l'expliquiez bien.""

In charging the jury the learned trial judge dealt fully
with the danger of convicting an accused upon the uncorroborated evidence of an
accomplice or accomplices. His charge in this regard is not a subject of
complaint before us but the directions given in regard to the rebuttal evidence
must be considered in the light of what had been said on the matter of
corroboration and it is important to

[Page 124]

note that there was a complete failure to instruct the jury
that before evidence can be considered as corroborative within the rule it must
be evidence which tends to implicate the accused, or, as it is often put, it
must be evidence which tends to show not merely that the crime charged has been
committed but that the accused committed it.

The effect of this rebuttal evidence was dealt with by the
learned trial judge in the following passages in his charge to the jury:

Il y a aussi le fait du voyage du retour et de
ce qui s'est passé à Québec, vous vous demanderez s'il n'y a pas certains faits
que ces trois témoina rapportent qui ne sont pas corroborés par des témoins
étrangers. Vous vous demanderez ensuite ce qui s'est passé chez Hamel dans la
nuit, et là, vous aurez à examiner si ce témoin dit la vérité, et si vous en
venez à la conclusion que réellement il y a eu arrêt chez Hamel, vous aurez là
une corroboration d'une partie importante des témoignages
de Légaré, Vallières et Demers.

* * *

C'est un incident assez important, c'est un
fait matériel, que s'il était prouvé, et c'est à vous à décider s'il est
prouvé, servirait à corroborer pour partie la version des trois témoins de la
Couronne.

* * *

Si vous en venez à la conclusion que Hamel n'a
pas dit vrai, vous avez là une corroboration du témoignage des trois témoins de
la Couronne, pour ce fait qui se serait passé entre le prétendu assaut et entre
le temps ou à Québec où le corps aurait été jeté à l'eau. Car lorsqu'on aurait
pris de la gazoline chez Hamel, la victime dans ce temps-là aurait été
assaillie et aurait été dans le fond de la voiture.

In my view there was both non-direction and misdirection as
to the purpose and effect of the rebuttal evidence.

In dealing with the second ground of appeal mentioned above,
it is first necessary to state briefly what occurred at the trial. Towards the
end of the examination in chief, by counsel for the Crown, the witness, Maurice
Légaré was asked the following questions and made the
following answers.

Q. Maintenant, monsieur Légaré, après que ça a
été fait, avez-vous recontré Roger Lizotte dans la suite?

R. Oui.

Q. Combien de temps après et où l'ayez-vous
rencontré?

R. Quinze jours, trois semaines après.

Q. A quel endroit?

R. Chez Omer Daigle.

Q. A-t-il été question de cette affaire-là?

R. Oui.

Q. Qu'est-ce qui s'est dit à ce propos-là?

R. Je m'en rappelle pas.

[Page 125]

Q. Vous en a-t-il parlé, lui?

R. Je sais qu'il m'a dit de fermer ma gueule.

Q. A-t-il ajouté d'autre chose?

R. Il dit: si tu fermes pas ta gueule, il y a
de quoi qui est dangereux.

Q. Y a-t-il eu d'autre chose de dit?

R. Je m'en rappelle pas.

The examination in chief concluded shortly after this and
was followed by a lengthy cross-examination in which the witness was asked
nothing whatever in regard to this particular incident. At the conclusion of
the cross-examination counsel for the Crown re-examined the witness on certain
matters which had arisen in the course of the cross-examination, and when he
had reached the end of this reexamination asked the court's permission to
examine on a matter which did not arise out of the cross-examination. Counsel
indicated that he wished to refer the witness to certain statements made by him
at the preliminary enquiry for the purpose of refreshing his memory. Counsel
for the defence objected on the ground that the evidence proposed to be given
would be inadmissible as constituting evidence of the bad character of the
accused. After some argument, the learned trial judge decided to permit the
re-examination. His grounds for so doing are stated in the following words:

Il n'est pas question d'un fait; il est
question d'un aveu, d'une déclaration de l'accusé. C'est différent entre
prouver un fait et une déclaration. Il y a une grosse différence. Je vais
permettre la question, mais seulement M. Dorion, complétez, s'il y a lieu, la
déclaration d'aveu que vous entendez établir, jusqu'à preuve du contraire.

The jury was brought back into the court room and the
transcript continues as follows:

Q. Monsieur Légaré, pour revenir à ces propos
qu'aurait tenus Lizotte chez Daigle, auxquels vous avez référé hier dans votre
examen en chef, vous rappelez-vous qu'il en a été question également à
l'enquête préliminaire devant l'Honorable Juge Pettigrew, alors que je vous
interrogeais?

R. Oui, monsier.

Q. Vous rappelez-vous que je vous ai posé la
question, à la page 115 …

LA COUR: Avant, demandez lui ce qu'il a
déclaré.

Me NOEL DORION, c.r.

Q. Quelle est la déclaration que vous avez
faite à l'enquête prélimi-que j'ai ici à la page 115 de l'enquête préliminaire.

R. Je ne me rappelle pas.

Q. Si vous ne vous en souvenez pas, je vais
vous lire la déclaration que j'ai ici à la page 115 de l'enquête préliminaire.

Q. Qu'est-ce que Lizotte a dit? racontez çà à
la Cour?

[Page 126]

R. Il a dit: ""Si tu fermes pas ta gueule,
je vais faire comme j'ai déjà fait à un autre."" avez-vous dit cela à
l'enquête préliminaire?

R. Oui, monsieur.

Q. Et ce que vous avez dit à l'enquête
préliminaire, était-ce exact?

R. Oui, monsieur.

Q. Alors, est-ce qu'il a dit cela, oui ou non?

R. Oui, monsieur.

LA COUR:

Q. Vous vous en rappelez maintenant?

Oui, monsieur.

Me NOEL DORION, c.r.

Q. Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit qu'il ferait? Je vous
posais la question—et vous avez répondu: d'après l'enquête préliminaire:
""il a dit: 'J'en ai déjà tiré un, je suis capable d'en tirer un autre';
vous rappelez-vous avoir dit cela à l'enquête préliminaire?

R. Oui, monsieur.

Q. Ce que vous avez dit à l'enquête
préliminaire était-il exact là-dessus?

R. Oui, monsieur.

Q. Alors, est-ce vrai qu'il vous a dit celà à
cette occasion-là?

R. Oui.

It appears to me that the evidence quoted above offends the
well settled rule stated in the following words in the judgment of the Judicial
Committee in Noor Mohamed v. The King 3.

In Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales (1894)
A.C. 57, 65, Lord Herschell L.C. delivering the judgment of the Board, laid
down two principles which must be observed in a case of this character. Of
these the first was that ""it is undoubtedly not competent for the
prosecution to adduce evidence tending to show that the accused has been guilty
of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of
leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal
conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being
tried."" In 1934 this principle was said by Lord Sankey L.C., with the
concurrence of all the noble and learned Lords who sat with him, to be ""one
of the most deeply rooted and jealously guarded principles of our criminal
law"" and to be ""fundamental in the law of evidence as conceived in
this country."" (Maxwell v. The Director of Public Prosecutions 4
).

The rule just stated, is subject to the qualification also
stated in Makin's case that the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to
show the commission of other crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be
relevant to an issue before the jury. It is urged that the evidence in question
was legally admissible and was relevant to the issue of the guilt or innocence
of the accused as being evidence of an attempt, on his part, to suppress
evidence by means of a

[Page 127]

threat. The Crown relies upon such statements as the
following: ""The presence or absence of facts showing (the accused's)
consciousness of having done the act may also be proved—e.g.,—the fabrication
or suppression of evidence."" Phipson on Evidence, 8th Edition at page 127.
There is a similar statement in Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Edition, vol. 2,
section 278. The principle on which such evidence is admitted is stated by
Phillimore J. in Rex v. Watt 5 It may be taken, I think,
to be the general rule that evidence may be given against a party in either a
civil or criminal case to show that he attempted to suppress evidence. It is
true that in the English cases cited in support of the rule proceedings were
actually pending at the time of the alleged suppression but there seems to be
no reason, in principle, for refusing to apply the rule to cases of attempts to
suppress evidence before any proceedings have been commenced. It is argued by
the Crown that had the witness Légaré given the evidence
objected to when he was first asked about his conversation with the accused it
would have been admissible under the principle just stated. It might be
sufficient for the disposition of this argument to point out that this did not
happen and that we are not concerned to discuss a situation which did not, in
fact, arise; but, since, in my view, there should be a new trial, I think it
desirable to state that, in my opinion, this is eminently a case in which the
learned judge presiding at the trial should, in the exercise of his discretion,
exclude any evidence indicating that Lizotte had made a statement which would
lead the jury to believe that on another occasion he had shot another person.
The rule which I think should guide the trial judge in regard to this matter is
referred to in the judgment of Isaacs C.J. giving the unanimous judgment of the
Court of Criminal Appeal, the other members of which were Channell, Bray, Avory
and Lush, JJ., in Rex v. Shellaker.6 At page
418, the learned Chief Justice refers to the class of cases ""in which,
though in strictness the evidence is admissible, the judge may be of opinion
that it is of so little real value and yet indirectly so prejudicial to the
prisoner, or that it

[Page 128]

is so remote, that it ought not to be given."" In Noor
Mohamed v. The King (supra) the
matter is put as follows at page 192.

It is right to add, however, that in all such cases the
judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is proposed to adduce is
sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to which it is
professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of justice that it
should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it can in the
circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the judge will be right to
exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight with admissibility. The
distinction is plain, but cases must occur in which it would be unjust to admit
evidence of a character gravely prejudicial to the accused even though there
may be some tenuous ground for holding it technically admissible. The decision
must then be left to the discretion and the sense of fairness of the judge.

I refer also to the same case at page 195.

… Their Lordships think that a passage from the judgment of
Kennedy J. in the well known case of Rex v. Bond, (1906) 2 K.B.
389, 398, may well be quoted in this connection: ""If, as is plain, we have
to recognize the existence of certain circumstances in which justice cannot be
attained at the trial without a disclosure of prior offences, the utmost
vigilance at least should be maintained in restricting the number of such
cases, and in seeing that the general rule of the criminal law of England,
which (to the credit, in my opinion, of English justice) excludes evidence of
prior offences, is not broken or frittered away by the creation of novel and
anomalous exceptions."" Their Lordships respectfully approve this
statement, which seems to them to be completely in accord with the later
statement of the Lord Chancellor in Maxwell's case (1935) A.C. 309, 320, when
he said ""It is of the utmost importance for a fair trial that the evidence
should be prima facie limited to matters relating to the transaction which
forms the subject of the indictment and that any departure from these matters
should be strictly confined."" They would regret the adoption of any
doctrine which made the general rule subordinate to its exceptions.

My reason for thinking that this evidence should have been
excluded, no matter when tendered, is that the statement, while calculated to
create a prejudice against the accused the extent of which could scarcely be
overestimated, has in the particular circumstances of this case substantially
no probative value. Evidence of a threat made by the accused for the purpose of
suppressing evidence, given by some independent witness, might, in a greater or
less degree, go to strengthen the jury's belief in Légaré's story
or to lessen their belief in that of the accused, but when the alleged incident
comes only out of the mouth of Légaré who had already
deposed to all the

[Page 129]

facts on which the Crown relied as establishing the guilt of
the appellant, its probative value seems to me to be very slight.

No permission to cross-examine Légaré was obtained nor was
he declared an adverse witness so that his statement made at the preliminary
hearing might be proved pursuant to the provisions of section 9  of the Canada
Evidence Act ; and there is nothing in the record to suggest that either of
these courses could properly have been followed. The sole ground on which
counsel for the Crown sought permission to show the deposition to the witness
was for the purpose of refreshing his memory and it is on that ground that it
was argued before us that the course followed was not unlawful.

At the trial while counsel for the defence objected
throughout to the re-examination of Légaré on this subject-matter he did not
expressly raise the objection that under the circumstances of this particular
case Légaré ought not to be allowed to refer to the transcript of his evidence
at the preliminary hearing for the purpose of refreshing his memory on the
grounds that such evidence had been given more than seventeen months after the
alleged conversation and that Légaré had repeatedly stated in the course of his
cross-examination that statements made by him at the preliminary hearing were
inaccurate. I do not think that the question whether such objection if made
should have been maintained is before us on this appeal. Had it been otherwise
it might have been necessary to consider whether the view expressed in Phipson
on Evidence, 8th Edition at page 461 and in Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd
Edition, Volume 13, pages 753 et seq., section 829, or
that in Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Edition at pages 100 et seq., sections
758 to 765, is to be preferred and whether if the former view is accepted the
principles which guide the court in determining whether a witness may look at a
writing to refresh his memory differ in the case of a deposition from those
applicable in the case of other writings. Assuming, but not deciding, that the
circumstances of this case were such that the witness might have been permitted
to refer to his deposition for the purpose of refreshing his memory, I agree
with Barclay J.

[Page 130]

that the whole incident was illegal. I think it was rightly
held in The King v. Laurin7, that the deposition must
not be read to the jury as was done in the case at bar. I think that the
evidence in question was wrongly admitted and that it cannot be said that it
did not cause the gravest prejudice to the accused.

As to the third ground of appeal, the court indicated to
Counsel for the Crown that it did not require him to address any argument in
regard to this ground. It was, I think, made clear at the time that the reason
for so doing was that in the particular circumstances of this case it was the
opinion of the court that the interference by the learned trial judge with the
cross-examination could not be said to have produced any substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice. The purpose of the cross-examination of Madame Boivin
which was stopped was to elicit an admission that she entertained ill feelings
towards the accused because of evidence which he had given against her husband
in criminal proceedings in which her husband had been convicted. The facts
which the defence sought to establish were brought out in the cross-examination
of the witness Boivin in the witness box. I am in agreement with Bertrand
J.8 where he says in his judgment:

C'était le droit de la défense de pouvoir
transquestionner le témoin sur ces raisons, et le juge aurait dû permettre ces
questions.

The ruling of the court on this point was not intended to
cast any doubt on the well established rule that the right to make full answer
and defence includes the right to cross-examine the Crown witnesses with
freedom and that any improper interference by the trial judge with this right
will usually be a sufficient ground for quashing a conviction.

As to the fourth ground of appeal, the learned trial judge
made only passing reference to the evidence given in support of the defence of
an alibi. I do not find it necessary to consider whether, in view of the
repeated and eminently proper direction given by the learned trial judge to the
jury that they must consider all the evidence whether given by the Crown or the
defence and if having done so they entertained a reasonable doubt as to the
guilt of the accused they should acquit him, it could be

[Page 131]

said that there was error in the charge in this regard; but
I do respectfully venture to suggest that in this case it would have been well
to follow the usual practice of indicating to the jury the nature of the
evidence put forward in

support of the alibi and telling them that, even if they are
not satisfied that the alibi has been proved, if the evidence in support of it
raises in their minds a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt it is their
duty to acquit him.

It is obvious that where an accused is not charged until
some seventeen months after the alleged commission of an offence, although he
be in fact innocent, it will only be in the rarest of cases that he is able to
establish an alibi beyond peradventure. While the evidence of the witness
Savard tendered in support of the alibi appeared to relate not to the week-end
of the 15th of June, 1947, but rather to the following week-end, the evidence
of the accused's wife, if believed, showed that he could not have committed the
crime and it was supported by the evidence of the accused's sister-in-law.

The fifth and sixth grounds of appeal may well be considered
together. It is argued on behalf of the appellant that the learned trial judge
failed to instruct the jury that before they could convict the accused of the
murder of Beaumont they must find on the evidence that it was proved beyond a
reasonable doubt not only that the victim was killed but that he was killed by
the accused. In my respectful opinion the learned trial judge failed to charge
the jury adequately on this point.

On the theory of the Crown as set out in the factum of
counsel for the respondent, the death of Beaumont was caused by Lizotte by striking
and kicking the victim in the face or by throwing him into the river when he
was still alive. If there was evidence on which the jury could properly find
beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim's death must have been caused by one
or other of these means, it would not be necessary that such evidence should be
of what is commonly referred to as a scientific nature but it was essential to
the verdict that there should be such evidence.

[Page 132]

In a case, such as this, where the defence is that the
accused had nothing to do with the matter whatever, it is obvious that the
defense will be unable to furnish any explanation as to how the victim met his
death and the onus rests upon the Crown to bring home to the accused, beyond a
reasonable doubt, the killing of the victim by him. This being so, and the
evidence upon which the jury might have come to the conclusion that the accused
killed Beaumont being largely circumstantial, it was, in my opinion essential
that they should be directed that if and in so far as they based their verdict
on circumstantial evidence, they must, in the words of Alderson B. in Hodge's
case 9, be satisfied not only that those
circumstances were consistent with his having committed the act but also that
such circumstances were inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than
that it was the prisoner who in fact killed Beaumont.

In the factum of the respondent it is submitted that it
matters not whether Beaumont was actually killed by the accused, by Légaré or
by Vallières or by the combined actions of the three of them. This submission
is based on the ground that each was responsible for the acts of the others by
reason of the provisions of section 69 , subsection 2  of the Criminal Code . The
addresses of counsel to the jury do not appear in the record before us but I
find nothing in the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury to indicate
that the theory of the Crown depended upon invoking the terms of section 69(2) .
In my opinion the evidence falls short of disclosing the formation by the
accused, Vallières and Légaré of a
common intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein, which preceded the alleged striking of the victim with a beer bottle
by Légaré and Vallières. Certainly
there was no adequate instruction to the jury as to the necessity of their
being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, Légaré
and Vallières had formed a common intention to
prosecute an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and that the
killing of Beaumont was or ought to have been known to be a probable
consequence of the prosecution of such common purpose before they

[Page 133]

could properly convict Lizotte, if, in their view, the
evidence was consistent with the view that the victim was killed by Légaré and
Vallières.

Our jurisdiction is limited to dealing with the points of
law upon which leave to appeal has been granted and these points do not include
a submission that there was no evidence upon which a jury could have found that
Lizotte, in fact, killed Beaumont, and I, therefore, do not consider whether
such an argument could have been supported. I am, however, of opinion that a
verdict of guilty cannot be supported in the absence of a clear direction to
the jury that they could not find the accused guilty unless they were satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that it was he who actually killed Beaumont. If, for
example, the jury were of the opinion that, consistently with the evidence, the
death of Beaumont may have been caused by the blows on the head with bottles
said to have been struck by Légaré and Vallières
and were not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that his death was
caused by blows struck by the accused or that the accused took part in throwing
him into the river while still alive they could not find him guilty of murder;
I cannot find that they were properly instructed in this regard.

The importance of what I respectfully consider to be
non-direction in regard to the effect to be given by the jury to circumstantial
evidence arises chiefly in regard to the matter of the actual cause of death. Hodge's
case was a case where all the evidence against the accused was
circumstantial. It is argued that the direction there prescribed is not
necessary in a case where there is direct evidence against the accused as well
as circumstantial evidence. However that may be, it is my opinion that where
the proof of any essential ingredient of the offence charged depends upon
circumstantial evidence it is necessary that the direction be given.

One further argument requires consideration. At the
conclusion of his able argument Mr. Dorion submitted that the jurisdiction of
this court in criminal matters being limited to questions of law and the court
appealed from having held that notwithstanding certain errors in law at the
trial there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage

[Page 134]

of justice and that the appeal should be dismissed under the
provisions, of section 1014(2)  of the Criminal Code , such decision
cannot be reviewed in this court. It is argued that in reaching the decision to
apply section 1014(2)  the Court of Appeal must of necessity have examined and
weighed the evidence and that consequently such decision is one of fact or of
mixed fact and law and, therefore, not subject to review in this court. It is
urged that the appeal must be dismissed even if this court should be of opinion
that any or all of the points of law argued before us are well taken.

I do not think that this argument is entitled to prevail. In
the case at bar it might perhaps be disposed of by pointing out that in my
opinion there were serious errors in matters of law at the trial which the
Court of Appeal did not regard as being errors at all; but even had the Court
of Appeal found the existence of all the errors in law which in my view did
occur and nonetheless dismissed the appeal pursuant to section 1014(2) , I do
not think that this court would be without jurisdiction.

Counsel were not able to refer us to any reported case in
which the argument put forward by Mr. Dorion appears to have been considered.
Its importance is obvious. If given effect it would have the result that in any
case in which a Court of Appeal dismisses an appeal because in its view, in
spite of error in law at the trial, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred this court could not entertain, or at all events
could not allow, an appeal from such judgment no matter how grave, in the view
of this court, was the error complained of.

The solution of this question depends, in the first
instance, on the wording of the relevant sections of the Criminal Code . It
will be observed that the jurisdiction of this court is conferred by a form of
wording different from that which confers jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal.
As has already been mentioned, the jurisdiction of this court is confined to
considering questions of law while the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to deal
not only with questions of law but with questions of mixed law and

[Page 135]

fact and with questions of fact alone. Under section 1014(1)
the Court of Appeal shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion:

(a) that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the
evidence; or

(b) that the judgment of the trial court should be set aside
on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law; or

(c) that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;

and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. Then
follows subsection 2, reading as follows:

The court may also dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding
that it is of opinion that on any of the grounds above mentioned the appeal
might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is also of opinion that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

The jurisdiction of this court is limited to hearing and
determining appeals on:

(i) any question of law on which there has been dissent in
the Court of Appeal.

(1023), or

(ii) any question of law, if leave to appeal, is granted by
a judge of this court.

(1025).

In my view it is the duty of this court, in the first
instance, to examine the point or points of law properly brought before it
either under (i) or (ii) above or, as may sometimes happen, under both (i) and
(ii). If the court comes to the conclusion that there has been no error in law
it follows that the appeal will be dismissed. If, on the other hand, this court
is of opinion that there has been error in law in regard to any one or more of
the points properly before it, then I think, there devolves upon it the duty,
in disposing of the appeal, to ""make such rule or order thereon, either in
affirmance of the conviction or for granting a new trial, or otherwise, or for
granting or refusing such application, as the justice of the case
requires."" (section 1024).

In my opinion once this court reaches the conclusion, on one
or more of the points properly before it, that there has been error in law
below it is unfettered in deciding what order should be made by the views
expressed in the Court of Appeal. This would be my view if the point were
devoid of authority. It is I think supported by the practice followed for many
years. While numerous cases

[Page 136]

might be cited it seems to me to be sufficient to refer to: Brooks
v. The King 10 and Stein v. The King 11.
In Brooks v. The King this court allowed the appeal and directed
a new trial on the ground that the learned trial judge had misdirected the jury
as to the consideration which they should give to certain evidence given by the
defence. In the Court of Appeal for Ontario 12, Masten J.A. dissented,
taking the view that because of this particular misdirection the conviction
should be quashed. The judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal 13
was delivered by Grant J.A. After discussing the misdirection complained of
that learned judge continued:

We are of opinion that upon this ground no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice can have occurred.

This court 14, after holding that there was
misdirection, continued:

… That it may seem probable to an appellate court perusing
the record that the jury would have reached that conclusion, does not warrant
affirming the conviction. That would, in effect, be to substitute the verdict
of the court for that of a jury properly instructed, to which the appellant was
entitled. Misdirection in a material matter having been shewn, the onus was
upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury, charged as it should have
been, could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than find the appellant
guilty. Gouin v. The King (1926) S.C.R. 539, at p. 543; Allen v.
The King (1911) 44 Can. SCR. 331, at p. 339; Makin v. Att.-Gen.
for New South Wales (1894) A.C. 57, at p. 70. That burden the Crown, in the
view of the majority of the Court, has not discharged. There was non-direction
by the learned trial judge in a vital matter, tantamount in the circumstances
of this case to misdirection, and constituting a miscarriage of justice within
subs. 1(c) of s. 1014  of the Criminal Code . Upon the whole case, and
taking into consideration the entire charge, the majority of the Court, with
respect, finds itself unable to accept the view expressed by the learned judge
who delivered the majority judgment in the Appellate Division that ""no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice can have occurred"" at the
trial. (Criminal Code , s. 1014(2) ).""

Stein v. The King, supra, was an appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (4). The court consisted of
Perdue, C.J.M., Fullerton, Dennistoun, Prendergast and Trueman J.J.A. Fullerton
J.A. dissented on the ground that statements made by persons other than the
accused were wrongly admitted in evidence. Prendergast J.A. held that this
evidence had been wrongly admit-

[Page 137]

ted but that the appeal should be dismissed as there was no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. (See the report at page 379).
Trueman J.A. held that at least one of the statements admitted should have been
refused and continued,—""independently altogether of the statements made by
Paulin and Webster in the presence of Stein, the Crown's case was conclusively
made out. The jury must inevitably have arrived at the same verdict had the
impeached evidence not been admitted."" (See report at page 388). The Chief
Justice and Dennistoun J.A. simply agreed that the appeal should be dismissed.
It seems clear that the ratio decidendi of the majority of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba was that although an error in law had been made no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. This court also held
that the error in law complained of had occurred but, differing from the Court
of Appeal, held that it could not be said that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice had actually occurred, and allowed the appeal.

The view that this court exercises its own judgment as to
whether or not it can be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred, I think, appears not only from the two cases last cited
but also from Boulianne v. The King 15 and Schmidt
v. The King 16, in both of which this court gave effect
to the argument that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had
occurred, and dismissed the appeals, and from Chapdelaine v. The King
17
in which this court allowed the appeal, refusing to give effect to the argument
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred.

I have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that this is
not a case in which it can be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred by reason of the errors in law made at the trial which
have been pointed out above. The test to be applied is found in the words of
Kerwin J., giving the judgment of the court in Schmidt v. The King (supra).

… The meaning of these words has been considered in
this Court in several cases, one of which is Gouin v. The King (1926)
S.C.R. 539, from all of which it is clear that the onus rests on the Crown to
satisfy

[Page 138]

the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the
same if the charge had been correct or if no evidence had been improperly
admitted. The principles therein set forth do not differ from the rules set
forth in a recent decision of the House of Lords in Stirland v. Director
of Public Prosecutions (1944) A.C. 315,
i.e., that the proviso that the Court of Appeal may dismiss the appeal if they
consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred in
convicting the accused assumes a situation where a reasonable jury, after being
properly directed, would, on the evidence properly admissible, without doubt
convict.

As, in my view, there should be a new trial, it is not
desirable that the evidence should be discussed at any length. I do not think
it can be said that a properly instructed jury acting honestly and reasonably
might not have acquitted the appellant.

For the reasons stated above and particularly because of
error in regard to the matters set out in the first, second, fifth and sixth
grounds of appeal, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the
conviction quashed and a new trial ordered.

Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA

Criminal law—Assault occasioning bodily harm—Accused
owner of premises on which acts occurred—As hotel keeper he retained two
suitcases for rent due by former roomer—Friends tried to obtain them without
paying—Whether injured person a trespasser with intent to commit a wrong or an
invitee—Right of accused to resist—Deree of force permisisble to repel
assault—Hotel Keepers Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 98—Criminal Code  ss. 57 , 290 .

[Page 393]

The accused, being the proprietor of a rooming house, retained
two suitcases belonging to a former woman roomer as security for unpaid rent.
Four of her friends decided to obtain them without paying the rent. On arriving
at the house one remained outside in a taxi and the three others went into the
room occupied by the accused and his wife and when their purpose was known a
fight started and the accused hit one of them with a hammer, fracturing his
skull. The accused was convicted in police court of assault occasioning bodily
harm, the magistrate holding that the men were not trespassers. The Court of
Appeal being equally divided, his appeal was dismissed.

Held: The failure of the trial judge to appreciate that
the men were wrongdoers and under the circumstances trespassers, as well as his
failure to direct himself as to the effect of sec. 57  of the Criminal Code  under
which the accused had the right to resist provided he did not use more force
than was necessary, amounted to misdirection and therefore a new trial ordered.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba 1 dismissing on an equal division,
Richards and Coyne J.A. dissenting, the appeal of the appellant from his
conviction, before Macdonell J., on a charge of assault occasioning bodily
harm.

The material facts of the case and the questions at issue
are stated in the above head note and in the judgment now reported.

W. A. Molloy for the appellant.

C. W. Tupper, K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Estey J.:—The
appellant, John Nykolyn, was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily
harm upon the person of Peter Farr at Winnipeg on July 29, 1947. His conviction
was affirmed by an equal division in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 2,
Mr. Justice Richards and Mr. Justice Coyne dissenting. Several grounds of
dissent are set out in the formal judgment. It seems sufficient to deal with
the following only:

(1) The learned magistrate failed to direct himself
that Farr, Pyke and Gendre were, as they entered upon the
premises, trespassers engaged in the purpose of carrying out a conspiracy to
commit a criminal offence.

[Page 394]

(2) That the invitation as found by the learned
magistrate was given under duress or misapprehension of the purpose of the men,
and therefore not an invitation in law.

(3) That the accused had a right in law to resist the
taking of the property from his premises.

The learned magistrate accepted the evidence of Farr, Pyke
and Gendre, which may be summarized: The appellant
conducted a rooming house. A few days before July 29, 1946, a young woman left
appellant's rooming house but being unable to pay her rent the appellant
retained her two suitcases, under the provisions of The Hotel Keepers Act, R.S.M.
1940, ch. 98. No question is raised as to the right of the appellant to retain
these suitcases.

Farr was present and took part in the conversation between
the young woman and appellant when the suit-oases were retained. In fact he
said that one of the suitcases was his, it having been loaned to her. The rent
has neither been tendered nor paid. On July 29th Farr, Pyke, Gendre
and Seymour were in the beer parlour at the Woodbine Hotel in Winnipeg
where they had a few glasses of beer. There Farr told the other three the story
of the retention of the suitcases and they decided to go and get them. They all
went, as Pyke said ""We expected there might be some trouble,"" and as
Farr said that they might ""over-awe"" the appellant ""with
superior strength."" They proceeded shortly after five o'clock in the
afternoon in a taxi. At the rooming house Seymour remained in the taxi with the
driver while Farr, Pyke and Gendre went into the rooming
house. Appellant lived on the ground floor at the rear of the hall. Farr said
that the three of them went to the door and when they knocked it was opened by
appellant. Farr asked for the suitcases and the appellant said ""Just a
minute"" and went out, while Mrs. Nykolyn said ""Take them."" Farr
and Pyke walked in, seeing the grips under a table in the room picked them up,
when Mrs. Nykolyn began yelling and striking Pyke with a flashlight. Pyke
apparently paid no attention to her conduct and carried one of the suitcases
out to the taxi.

The evidence is not entirely clear as to just what happened
but Gendre, who did not go into the room but remained in
the hall, said that while Mrs. Nykolyn was yelling and striking Pyke with the
flashlight, Nykolyn came

[Page 395]

out into the hall apparently following Farr who had the
other suitcase. Gendre held the appellant, not because he
entertained any fear of Nykolyn assaulting him, but because as he said,
""there was Peter Farr and Mr. Nykolyn arguing about suitcases, and I was
going to quiet them down."" He then said that after a couple of minutes
""I let Mr. Nykolyn go and he said 'Just a minute' and he went behind the
door and he picked up a hammer …"" Gendre said he saw
Nykolyn hit Farr with the hammer and then he (Gendre) struck
Nykolyn on the jaw with his fist as a result of which Nykolyn fell into his own
room and he, Gendre, helped Farr out of the house.

Seymour said he remained in the taxi and ""the taxi
driver and I heard the screaming and we thought there was a murder on.""
The taxi driver said ""I could hear the noise, but I could not distinguish
what it was.""

The magistrate accepted the evidence of the three men but
failed to direct his attention to the admitted fact that they had gone to
appellant's home, as arranged in the beer parlour, to take from him the two
suitcases. Farr knew why the suitcases were held because he was present when
the appellant had asserted his right to and did retain them. Appellant, in
retaining them, was exercising his right under the law of Manitoba and thereby
had a property interest in and a right of possession to these suitcases. If, as
they deposed, these men went there under the terms of a conspiracy or with a
common intent to 'commit the offence of theft, they were wrongdoers' as they
entered upon the premises and were, under the circumstances, trespassers. The
learned magistrate made no reference in his judgment to this evidence and
misdirected himself in law in stating ""When they were on the property they
weren't trespassing— they rang the bell.""

The magistrate also found that ""they were told they
could get the grips—there was no trespassing there."" His finding that they
were told to get the grips is based on the statement of Mrs. Nykolyn, who,
immediately the door was opened, made some such remark as ""Take
them."" Some question was raised as to the authority of Mrs. Nykolyn to
grant such permission on behalf of her husband, which, under the circumstances,
I do not think it is neces-

[Page 396]

sary to consider. Why the invitation was given is not clear.
It seems to have been given before any trouble started when she may have been
under the impression that the parties had come for the suitcases and would pay
the rent and take them lawfully. Certainly the moment she found they were
taking them without doing so she began actively to resist. The fact that Mrs.
Nykolyn may have been momentarily deceived in thinking the parties were upon a
lawful errand and under that misapprehension gave the invitation as found,
would not alter the fact that these men were throughout proceeding in the
execution of their unlawful purpose and were trespassers. The learned
magistrate did not direct his attention to this phase of the case. Perhaps it
should be mentioned that apart from all questions as to whether the invitation
was given under fear or apprehension of consequences or under the belief that
the parties intended to pay the rent for which the suitcases were held, which
does not appear to have been 'Considered, there is the important question
whether or not by her conduct she had withdrawn any permission or licence she
had given that would permit these parties to take the suitcases away. The
learned magistrate did not direct his attention to this important issue and his
failure to do so would seem, under the circumstances, to constitute a
misdirection.

The appellant was in his own home in peaceful possession of
the suitcases in question. Sec. 57  of the Criminal Code  provides:

57. Every one who is in peaceable possession of any movable
property or thing under a claim of right, and every one acting under his
authority, is protected from criminal responsibility for defending such
possession, even against a person entitled by law to the possession of such
property or thing, if he uses no more force than is necessary.

The appellant was in peaceful possession of the suitcases
under a claim of right and therefore had, under the foregoing section, a right
to resist these men in their endeavour to take the suitcasess provided or so
long as he did not use more force than was necessary. The record here would
indicate, particularly if the permission, found by the learned magistrate to
have been given by Mrs. Nykolyn, was withdrawn or otherwise ineffective in law,
that the issue under sec. 57  would be a very important part of this case

[Page 397]

and to which the learned magistrate did not direct his
attention. Whether one in exercising his right under the foregoing section uses
more force than is necessary is a question of fact which, under the particular
circumstances of this case, should be determined at a trial where the evidence
is directed to this issue and the question of credibility of the witnesses
determined by the presiding magistrate who has an opportunity to observe them.

In my opinion the appeal should be allowed and a new trial
directed.

Appeal allowed; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Evidence—Statements made to police
after questioning—Whether made voluntarily—Whether incriminating or
exculpatory—Admissibility—Criminal Code  s. 259 .

While in custody, on a coroner's warrant, as a material
witness, during the investigation of a murder case, appellant made two written
statements to the police during the course of questions put to him by them. For
the first statement, the usual warning was not given before accused bad
completed his verbal answers, but it was given before the written statement was
signed. This statement contained an account of the movements of the appellant
for some days before and after the day of the commission of the crime, which
indicated that he could not have been concerned in the crime. It also contained
admissions of his intimate relations with the wife of the murdered man. The
second statement before which a warning was given, reiterated the substance of
the first, but added a complete confession of the commission of the crime by
appellant. The trial judge ruled that these statements were admissible in
evidence and the majority in the Court of Appeal agreed with him.

Held: Estey J. dissenting, that both statements were voluntarily
made and that the appeal should be dismissed.

Held also, that the first statement was incriminating
and not exculpatory (The Chief Justice and Taschereau J. contra).

Held further, that the dictum in Gach v. The
King [1943] S.C.R. '254 that ""when a person has been arrested, all
confessions made to a person in authority, as a result of questioning, are
inadmissible in evidence, unless proper caution has been given"" was
obiter: Ibrahim v. The King [1914] A.C. 599 and Prosko v. The
King 63 S.C.R. 226 followed. (The Chief Justice and Taschereau J.
expressing the opinion that the Gach case had no application to the
present case as, in their view, the first statement was exculpatory).

Per Estey J. (dissenting): The first statement was
incriminating and the trial judge misdirected himself to the effect that the
statement was exculpatory and not evidence against the accused. That though a
warning was given prior to the second statement, it was immediately followed by
questions and incidents which were not sufficiently disclosed by the evidence
to justify a conclusion that the statement was voluntarily made.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench,
appeal side, province of Quebec 1, dismissing

[Page 263]

(Bissonnette J.A. dissenting) the appellant's appeal from
his conviction, at trial before Coté J. and a jury, on a charge of murder.

Hon. Lucien Gendron K.C. for the appellant.

Nöel Dorion K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was
delivered by

Taschereau, J.:—The
appellant Gaston Boudreau was charged with the murder of Joseph Laplante, and
on the 26th of September, 1947, he was found guilty and condemned to be hanged.
This conviction was upheld by the Court of King's Bench, Province of Quebec 2,
Mr. Justice Bissonnette dissenting, on the ground that certain confessions made
by the appellant were illegally admitted in evidence.

The main facts leading to these alleged confessions which
are impugned, may be briefly stated as follows:

On the morning of May the 29, 1947, the body of Laplante was
found on the highway, leading to Lake Castagnier, a small municipality near
Amos, Abitibi, P.Q, The police authorities started immediately to investigate,
and the Coroner's inquest, originally fixed for the 29th of May, was adjourned sine
die by Coroner Brousseau until further evidence could be obtained. It was
resumed on the 6th of June, 1947.

At first, Constable Lefebvre, Sergeant Dupont, Sergeant
Massue, Detective Oggier and Dr. Roussel, legal medico expert for the Provincial
Government, who had come from Amos and Montreal to try and solve the mystery of
Laplante's death, which was obviously a brutal murder, had but very scant clues
leading to the discovery of the author of this crime.

On Sunday, the 1st of June, Lefebvre, Oggier and Dr. Roussel
went at Laplante's house where the body was exposed. There, they saw amongst
others, Mrs. Laplante and Gaston Boudreau, the appellant in the present case.
As Boudreau looked nervous, he was asked by Oggier to follow him, and was brought
the same evening to Amos at the police headquarters. He was there put under the

[Page 264]

supervision of the jailer, in the Constable's room, and
Sergeant Massue telephoned the Coroner to obtain the necessary authorization to
detain him as an important witness. This authorization was given verbally on
Sunday 'night, and the next morning, Massue received by mail a written
authorization to detain Boudreau.

On that morning, Massue summoned Boudreau in his office and
told him that he was held as an important witness. In view of the fact that
Boudreau's friendship with Mrs. Laplante was publicly known, it was decided to
ask him a few questions, and on Tuesday evening, at about eight thirty, Massue
questioned him on his movements during the week of the murder. Without being
warned, Boudreau said that he had left the previous Tuesday to go hunting at a
place called Canton Vassal, and that he had taken with him a shot gun. He
explained his run in the bush where he had sprung his traps, his return on foot
the following Saturday to one Therrien's house, and then to his home in a taxi
with one Carpentier. He also gave some information concerning his fire-arms,
his cartridges and the result of his hunt. Massue then pursued further his
investigation, and asked him about his relations with Mrs. Laplante. Boudreau
freely told the circumstances in which he had met her, and the fact unknown to
the police, that she was his mistress.

Boudreau was then asked if he was willing to repeat his
statement so that it could be taken in writing, and he agreed without hesitation.
Mr. Z. Bacon, secretary at the police headquarters, took down word for word
Boudreau's statement. As the sheet of paper on which the answers were to be
typewritten bore the regular warning, it was read to the accused before
anything was committed to writing. Upon completion, the whole document
including the warning, was read to the appellant who signed it after having
been sworn by a Justice of the Peace.

Oggier continued his investigation. It was discovered that
the pellets found in Laplante's skull were BB Gauge, shot very likely from a 12
gauge shot gun, the same calibre as the one found in Aubuchon's house and
belonging to Boudreau. The cartridges he had in his house were also BB. This
new evidence strengthened the detective's suspicions which at first were very
slight, but were, nevertheless

[Page 265]

still quite insufficient to charge Boudreau with murder.
There was no direct evidence to link him with the commission of the crime.

On the 5th of June, when Oggier returned from Lake
Castagnier with Massue, it was decided to call Boudreau back to obtain from him
additional information. Massue told him that he was held as an important
witness concerning Laplante's death, and warned him that he was not
obliged to talk, but that if he wished to say anything, it could be used as
evidence before the Court. Boudreau then volunteered to give further
information. He gave additional details concerning his intimacy with Mrs.
Laplante, and while he was talking, Massue left the office to get a glass of
water, and the accused spontaneously admitted to Oggier, without any question
being put to him: ""I may as well tell you, I killed him."" Oggier
called Massue back, and in the presence of Oggier and Massue Boudreau told the
whole story of how he killed Laplante. This statement was typewritten by an
employee of the police, and sworn to by Boudreau.

The learned trial judge ruled that these statements were
admissible in evidence, and the majority of the Court of Appeal 3 agreed
with him.

The law concerning the admissibility of statements made to
persons in authority, finds its application only when these statements are 'of
an incriminating nature. The first statement made by the appellant on the 2nd
of June to. Massue, was not in my opinion of that 'character, and nothing can
be found in it, which directly or indirectly tends to connect the appellant
with Laplante's murder. In fact, Boudreau denied all participation in the
offence, by telling all that he had done in the course of his hunting trip. His
statement was exculpatory. The admission of his intimacy with Mrs. Laplante may
at the most constitute a possible motive, but cannot in itself be considered as
evidence of guilt. It does not show in the remotest way that the appellant was
involved in Laplante's death.

Counsel for the appellant has cited the case of Gach v.
The King 4. I do not think that the present case
can be governed by that case, where the accused had made confessions of an
incriminating nature. The Court 5

[Page 266]

held that in view of the circumstances revealed by the
evidence, the accused was entitled to the same protection, before being
questioned by a person in authority, as if he had been in custody.

As to the second statement made on June the 5th, it is said in
the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Bissonnette, that it was a logical
sequence of the first one, and therefore became illegal, notwithstanding the
warning by the police officers. With due respect, I do not agree with this
contention. I fail to see anything in the first statement that could in any way
influence the second one, and be an inducement for Boudreau to make it to the
police. Boudreau spoke freely after having been warned, and I have no doubt
that it is without fear and without a hope of advantage from the detectives,
that he made the minutely detailed recital of this premeditated crime. The
spontaneity of that part of the confession, dealing with the actual killing,
establishes clearly its voluntary character, and this, with all the other circumstances
shown at the trial, leaves no doubt in my mind, that the conclusions reached by
the learned trial judge on the ""voir-dire"", were right.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Kerwin J.:—The
first statement has been treated by the majority of the judges in the Courts 6
below as exculpatory and I understand that that is also the view in this Court
of my lord the Chief Justice and my brother Taschereau. There is no doubt,
however, that the statement affords a possible motive for the murder, and in my
opinion that would be sufficient to warrant applying the rule, if it exists,
that once a person is under arrest any statement given by him in answer to
questions by those in authority is inadmissible unless preceded by a proper
warning. It was argued that such a rule was laid down by this Court in Gach v.
The King 7. Mr. Justice Taschereau, who spoke for
the majority in that case, is of opinion that the decision does not apply but
that is because, in his view, the first statement given by Boudreau was
exculpatory. For the reason given, I am, with respect, unable to concur and it
therefore becomes necessary to consider the Gach decision.

[Page 267]

I believe it is agreed that it was sufficient for the
disposition of that appeal 8 to decide that the statement there in
issue was given as a result of a threat and that the following statement, at
page 254, was therefore unnecessary for the actual decision:—

There is no doubt that when a person has been arrested, all
confessions made to a person in authority, as a result of questioning, are
inadmissible in evidence unless proper caution has been given. This rule which
is found in Canadian and British law is based on the sound principle that
confessions must be free from fear, and not inspired by a hope of advantage
which an accused may expect from a person in authority.

This statement is couched in very broad terms and, if read
in its widest sense, would prevent, for instance, the placing in evidence of
any incriminating answers to questions put by a police officer to a person
arrested at the scene of a crime immediately after its commission. It has been
construed to change the law as it was considered to be prior to Gach,—by the
Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Scory 9, and by
the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal 10 in the present case and
is really the basis of the appeal to this Court.

Again with great respect, I think it advisable that it
should now be stated clearly what this Court considers the law to be. My view
is that it has not been changed from that set out in Ibrahim v. Rex 11
and Rex v. Prosko 12. The fundamental question is whether a
confession of an accused offered in evidence is voluntary. The mere fact that a
warning was given is not necessarily decisive in favour of admissibility but,
on the other hand, the absence of a warning should not bind the hands of the
Court so as to compel it to rule out a statement. All the surrounding
circumstances must be investigated and, if upon their review the Court is not
satisfied of the voluntary nature of the admission, the statement will be
rejected. Accordingly, the presence or absence of a warning will be a factor
and, in many cases, an important one.

In the present case the accused gave a second statement in
which is repeated the admissions of his intimacy with the deceased's wife
contained in the first statement but, in addition, contained an admission of
the slaying. The second statement was made after a proper warning. The

[Page 268]

trial judge admitted both in evidence and notwithstanding
that he admitted the first because of his view that it was exculpatory, I am
not prepared to disagree with his conclusion as to either. The police were not
compelled to tell the accused specifically that notwithstanding his first
statement he was not obliged to make another, and the first contains nothing
that is not incorporated in the latter.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Rand, J.:—The
appellant Boudreau was 'Convicted of murder and the point of dissent on which
he comes to this Court is the improper reception of two written statements, the
first containing an admission of intimacy with the wife of the murdered man and
the second, in addition to a repetition and an elaboration of the first
admission, a full confession of the deed itself. At the time of making them he
was being held under a coroner's warrant as a material witness. There was no
more than a suspicion against him when in the first conversation with police
officers in which questions were asked him he purported to detail his movements
on the two or three days before the death and admitted the intimacy. Having
consented to make the statement in writing, a justice of the peace was summoned
and the statement made out, signed and sworn to by him. Before the signing, the
justice read out the words of the usual warning which happened to be printed
across the top of the paper. Two days later, after a formal warning, a further
discussion took place with two officers and while one of them was momentarily
out of the room and after a reference had been made to his mother, Boudreau
suddenly burst out with the words ""j'aime autant vous le dire: c'est moi
qui l'a tué."" This was followed by details. He then, as in the first case,
consented to have the statement put in writing, and a like course was followed
as before.

The objection is that the first oral admission, without
warning, of what, in my opinion, was, in the circumstances, an incriminating
fact, nullified both statements: that, having committed himself so far, what
followed was its compulsive sequence, unless, which was not the case, the
warning on the second occasion had so specifically dealt with the previous
statement as to efface any effect that might then have remained on his mind.

[Page 269]

In support of this position, Rex v. Gach 13,
is cited. Mr. Gendron argued that what was formerly a rule of practice under
which the trial judge could and almost invariably did but was not bound to rule
out confessions resulting from questions put to a person under arrest by one in
authority without a warning has, by that decision, been converted into an
inflexible rule of law; and it is pointed out that that view of it has been
taken by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Scory 14.
The particular language from which this conclusion is drawn is that of
Taschereau J. in the following paragraph:—

There is no doubt that when a person has been arrested, all
confessions made to a person in authority, as a result of questioning, are
inadmissible in evidence unless proper caution has been given. This rule which
is found in Canadian and British law is based on the sound principle that
confessions must be free from fear, and not inspired by a hope of advantage
which an accused may expect from a person in authority.

As the reasons of both Kerwin, J. and Taschereau, J. show,
there was in the case clear evidence of a threat on the part of the officer,
and the facts which might have called for such an examination of the rule as is
suggested were not present. At the most, then, it could be only a dictum: but I
am bound to say that I cannot take the language as intended to do more than to
state the existing rule. It is, therefore, I think, a misinterpretation of this
decision to treat it as having effected a significant change in the character
of the rule, and the point 'as put to us by Mr. Gendron fails.

The cases of Ibrahim v. Rex 15, Rex
v. Voisin 16 and Rex v. Prosko 17
lay it down that the fundamental question is whether the statement is
voluntary. No doubt arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse
apprehension which a warning may or may not suffice to remove, and the rule is
directed against the danger of improperly instigated or induced or coerced
admissions. It is the doubt cast on the truth of the statement arising from the
circumstances in which it is made that gives rise to the rule. What the
statement should be is that of a man free in volition from the compulsions or
inducements of authority and what is sought is assurance that that is the

[Page 270]

case. The underlying and controlling question then remains:
is the statement freely and voluntarily made? Here the trial judge found that
it was. It would be a serious error to place the ordinary modes of
investigation of crime in a strait jacket of artificial rules; and the true
protection against improper interrogation or any kind of pressure or inducement
is to leave the broad question to the court. Rigid formulas1 can be
both meaningless to the weakling and absurd to the sophisticated or hardened
criminal; and to introduce a new rite as an inflexible preliminary condition
would serve no genuine interest of the accused and but add an unreal formalism
to that vital branch of the administration of justice.

I do not mean to imply any right on the part of officers to
interrogate or to give countenance or approval to the practice; I leave it as
it is, a circumstance frequently presented to courts which is balanced between
a virtually inevitable tendency and the danger of abuse.

The appeal must therefore be dismissed.

The judgment of Kellock and Locke JJ. was delivered by

Kellock, J.:—This
appeal comes to this court upon the basis of the dissenting judgment of
Bissonnette J. in the court below 18, which affirmed the conviction of the
appellant by the Superior Court on a charge of murder. The questions raised
involve the admissibility of two statements made by the appellant to police
officers during the course of questions put to him by them on two different
occasions. On the first occasion the usual warning was not given until the
appellant had completed his verbal answers but it was given before his
statement was committed to writing and signed by him. This statement contained
a circumstantial account of the movements of the appellant for some days before
and after the day upon which the crime was committed, which indicated that he
could not have been concerned in the crime. It also contained admissions
however, with respect to relations existing between the appellant and the wife
of the murdered man.

The second statement reiterated the substance of the first,
but added a complete and circumstantial account of the commission of the crime
by the appellant. Mr. Justice

[Page 271]

Bissonnette treated the first statement as having been made
without a warning and he considered it inadmissible on the ground that it had
been laid down by this court in the case of Rex v. Gach 19,
that lack of warning in any case rendered a statement inadmissible as a matter
of law. He was also of the 'opinion that the inadmissibility of the first
statement rendered the second inadmissible, as in his view, the appellant ought
to have been pointedly warned that notwithstanding he had made the first
statement he need not say anything. The question is therefore raised as to
whether or not, assuming the warning with respect to the first statement to
have been insufficient, either statement was thereby rendered inadmissible as a
matter of law, even although the learned trial judge, upon a consideration of
all the relevant circumstances, was of opinion that in each instance the
appellant had spoken voluntarily.

The governing principle is stated by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim
v. The King 20 as follows:

It has long been established as a postive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement,
in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear or prejudice
or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. The
principle is as old as Lord Hale. The burden of proof in the matter has been
decided by high authority in recent times in Regina v. Thompson 21
…

At page 613 Viscount Sumner refers to the decision of the
Court of Criminal Appeal in England in Rex v. Knight and Thayre 22,
and quotes from the judgment of Channell J. at page 713, where the latter said
with respect to answers to questions put by a constable after arresting:

When he has taken anyone into custody … he ought not to
question the prisoner … I am not aware of any distinct rule of evidence, that
if such improper questions are asked the answers to them are inadmissible, but
there is clear authority for saying that the judge at the trial may in his
discretion refuse to allow the answers to be given in evidence …

On the same page Viscount Sumner refers to an excerpt from
the judgment of Channell J. in Rex v. Boot and Jones 23,
where the latter said at p. 179:

the moment you have decided to charge him and praotically
got him into custody, then, inasmuch as a judge even cannot ask a question, or
a magistrate, it is ridiculous to suppose that a policeman can. But there is

[Page 272]

no actual authority yet that if a policeman does ask a
question it is inadmissible; what happens is that the judge says it is not
advisable to press the matter.

Viscount Sumner concludes:

And of this Darling J., delivering the judgment of the Court
of Criminal Appeal observes the ""principle was put very clearly by
Channell J.""

Lord Sumner at p. 614 refers to this view of the law as
""a probable opinion of the present law, if it is not actually the better
opinion"", although their Lordships say that the final declaration as to
the law on the subject should be left to the ""revising functions of a
general Court of Criminal Appeal.""

In Rex v. Colpus 24, a decision of the
Court of Criminal Appeal in England, in delivering the judgment of that court
Viscount Reading C.J., said at 579:

We do not propose to say more in this case than that the
principle laid down in Reg. v. Thompson 25 and
approved in Ibrahim v. Rex 26 is the principle which
is to be applied in the present case.

The case before that court involved statements made by the
appellants before a military court of inquiry. These were admitted although
there had been no warning, the court being of opinion that on all the evidence
they were voluntary statements.

In the following year in The King v. Voisin 27,
again a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant, in response to
a request by the police, went to a police station where he made a statement
which was taken down in writing. He was then asked whether he had any objection
to writing down certain words, and upon his stating he had no objection, he
wrote them. He was not cautioned at any time. It was contended at the trial
that the words which he had written were inadmissible on the ground that the
writing was obtained by the police without having first cautioned the appellant
and while he was in custody. The writing was, however, admitted. The court
followed the judgment of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's case 28. At
page 558 A. T. Lawrence J. said:

The question as to whether a person has been duly cautioned
before the statement was made is one of the circumstances that must be taken

[Page 273]

into consideration, but this is a circumstance upon which
the judge should exercise his discretion. It cannot be said as a matter of law
that the absence of a caution makes the statement inadmissible.

I do not think it possible to regard this case as other than
a case of a statement obtained from a person in custody as the result of
questioning by the police and it was so dealt with by the court. There is, in
my opinion, no room for distinction whether there be one or more than one
question asked.

In 1922 the question came before this court in Prosko v.
The King 29. In that case the appellant was in the
custody of two American detectives for the purpose of being brought before the
American Immigration authorities. A warrant for his arrest on a charge of
murder had been issued in this country.

The appellant was told by the immigration officers that they
were going to take up his case with the United States Immigration officials and
have him deported to Canada, whereupon he said, ""I am as good as dead if
you send me there."" Upon the officers asking ""why"", he gave the
statement which was in question. No warning had been given to him. The Chief
Justice, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur, JJ., followed and applied the principle
laid down in Ibrahim v. The King 30, The
King v. Colpus 31 and The King v. Voisin 32.
In this case but a single question was asked. The case was treated by all the
members of the court as one of answers made to questions by persons in
authority without a warning having been given. It was held that the evidence
was admissible. The court considered that the basic question to be answered was
as to whether or not the statement had been voluntarily made. At page 237
Anglin J. said:

The two detectives were persons in authority; the accused
was in my opinion in the same plight as if in custody in extradition
proceedings under a warrant charging him with murder. No warning whatever' was
given to him. While these facts do not in themselves suffice to exclude the
admissions, as Duff J. appears to have held in The King v. Kay '33,
they are undoubtedly circumstances which require that the evidence tendered to
establish their voluntary character should be closely scrutinized.

In Gach v. The King 34, the
appellant was charged with having unlawfully received certain ration' books,
knowing them to have been stolen. Certain police officers

[Page 274]

called upon the appellant and told him that one Nagurski had
stated that he had sold ration books to the appellant, that he could be
prosecuted, and that in any event it would be better for him to hand them over.
At the end of the conversation they told him that he was to accompany them to
the police barracks to talk to an inspector. The inspector there told the
appellant that he would, in all probability, be charged. He was then asked
certain questions and made certain answers. No warning was given. The admissibility
of these answers was challenged.

Kerwin J., who delivered the judgment of himself and Duff
C.J., referred to Ibrahim v. The King 35 and Sankey
v. The King 36, and held the evidence inadmissible as
having been made after appellant had been told by the police that it would be
better if he made a statement.

The judgment of Taschereau J., with whom Rinfret J., as he
then was, and Hudson J. agreed, reached the same result. The judgment of the
majority is based upon the judgments in The Queen v. Thompson 37, Rex v. Knight and Thayre 38,
Lewis v. Harris 39, and Rex v. Crowe and
Myerscough 40.

As already mentioned, the first two of the above four
authorities are referred to by Viscount Sumner in Ibrahim's 41
case. In The Queen v. Thompson 42 there is no suggestion
that any warning had been given. The statement, however, was not rejected on
that ground but on the ground that the Grown had not satisfied the burden
resting on it of establishing that the statement had been made voluntarily.
That is all that the case is cited for by Taschereau J. Had the mere lack of
warning been regarded as rendering the statement inadmissible, the strong court
which decided The Queen v. Thompson 43, would
undoubtedly have said so. They did not.

Again in Rex v. Knight and Thayre 44,
the statement which the Crown tendered had in fact been preceded by a warning. It
is not therefore in itself a decision as to

[Page 275]

admissibility or inadmissibilty where no warning is given.
Taschereau J. quotes from the reasons for judgment of Channell J. at p. 713,
including:

When he has taken anyone into custody, and also before doing
so when he has already decided to make the charge, he ought not to question the
prisoner. A magistrate or judge cannot do it, and a police officer certainly
has no more right to do so.

Channell J. immediately adds, however, what is included in
that which is quoted by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's 45 case:

I am not aware of any distinct rule of evidence, that if
such improper questions are asked the answers to them are inadmissible, but
there is clear authority for saying that the judge at the trial may in his
discretion refuse to allow the answer to be given in evidence and in my opinion
that is the right course to pursue.

That is not to say that the rule is that all such answers
are inadmissible, but that as a matter of discretion the judge may refuse to
admit. That this is the correct view of what the learned judge says is shown by
that part of his direction in Rex v. Booth and Jones 46,
quoted by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's case at p. 613:

… the (moment you have decided to charge him and practically
got him into custody, then, inasmuch as a judge even cannot ask a question, or
a magistrate, it is ridiculous to suppose that a policeman can. But there is no
actual authority yet that if a policeman does ask a question, it is
inadmissible—what happens is that the judge says it is not admissible to press
the matter.

In Rex v. Booth and Jones 47, as in
Rex v. Knight and Thayre 48, the statement tendered
had in fact been preceded by a warning.

In Lewis v. Harris 49, the
headnote to which is quoted by Taschereau J., a constable had observed a child
coming out of a store on a Sunday, and finding out from her that she had made a
purchase of candy, he went back into the store with her and asked the
proprietor certain questions, the admissibility of which was in question on the
appeal. In that case the fact was that the appellant was not in custody and the
constable had not made up his mind to lay a charge. The case is therefore not
in pari materia with the case at bar. In the course of his judgment
Darling J. said at p. 71:

A constable ought not, if he has made up his mind that
whatever the answer may be he will arrest the person to whom he is speaking, to

[Page 276]

ask that person an incriminating question. The law does not
say that the answer must be excluded and that it is not evidence, but it has
been frequently held that if that rule is infringed then the judge in his
discretion may reject the evidence, and it is tolerably certain that if there
is any sign that the evidence was unfairly obtained he would reject it. The
true rule is that nothing must be done to hold out an inducement to a person,
and no threat must be used to induce a person, to make an incriminating
statement …

The last case to which Taschereau J. refers is Rex v.
Crowe and Myerscough 50, a decision of Sankey J., as he then
was. The question involved was as to the admissibility of a statement in answer
to questions put by the police made by the appellant Myerscough before arrest
and before the police had determined to arrest her. After she had made the
answers orally, the appellant signed a written statement in which she said that
""This statement has been read over to me. It is made quite voluntarily and
is true"". Sankey J. admitted the statement on the grounds, (1) that it had
been made when she was not under arrest; (2) before it had been decided to
arrest her; and (3) that she herself had said it had been made voluntarily. In
the course of his judgment Sankey J. said what is quoted by Taschereau J., viz:

If a police officer has determined to effect an arrest, or
if the person is in custody, then be should ask no questions which will in any
way tend to prove the guilt of such person from this own mouth.

It is to be noted that Sankey J. does not say that if this
rule is disobeyed and a statement is made, it is inadmissible as a matter of
law.

It is clear therefore that in none of the cases referred to
in the judgment of the majority in Gach's 51 case,
is it laid down that a statement made by a person in custody in answer to
questions but by a person in authority, is, as a matter of law inadmissible. On
the contrary, the question is in all cases as to whether the Crown, as stated
in Rev. Thompson, supra, has satisfied the onus that the statement has
in fact been made voluntarily. While there may be expressions in the judgment
of the majority in Gach's case, taken apart from the context, which
might appear to extend the decisions, as pointed out by Atkinson J. in Lorentzen
v. Lydden & Co. 52:

[Page 277]

Again and again judges have been told by the Court of Appeal
and the House of Lords that words used in previous oases must be interpreted
with reference to the facts before the court and the issues with which it was
dealing.

In Gach's case it is plain from the judgment of the majority
that the statement sought to be used in evidence had been made by the appellant
after the officers had said to him ""that it would be better for him to
hand them over."" In these circumstances all the members of the court were
of opinion that it could not be said that the statement was voluntary.

I do not consider therefore that it can be said that
anything said in Gach's 53 case can be taken as inconsistent with
the previous decision in Prosko's 54 case by which the court
was bound, even though it could be said that the court was not also bound to
follow what was termed by Lord Sumner in Ibrahim's 55 case
as a ""probable opinion of the present law, if it is not actually the
better opinion.""

In the case at bar the second statement, which included the
substance of the first, was held by the trial judge to have been voluntarily
made. I think therefore that the appeal must be dismissed.

Estey, J.
(dissenting):—The appellant's conviction for the murder of Joseph Laplante was
affirmed by a majority in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) in Quebec 56.
Mr. Justice Bissonnette dissented on the bases as set out in the formal
judgment:

1. L'illégalité dans l'obtention et la
production de la première confession;

2. L'illégalité dans l'obtention et la
production de la deuxième confession, particulièrement en raison de
l'illégalité de la première;

3. L'inadmissibilité de la preuve des aveux ou
confessions.

Mr. Justice Bissonnette was of the opinion that the first
statement or confession was not exculpatory as the learned trial judge has
construed it, and because no warning had been given it was in his opinion
improperly admitted. He summarized his conclusions relative to the second
statement under three headings, as follows:

Le premier, c'est que j'estime que la mise en
garde sur la deuxième confession, même si elle a été faite, ne constituait pas,
sous les circonstances de cette cause, un avertissement suffisant, car ce jeune
homme ne

[Page 278]

pouvait alors ignorer qu'il avait déjà fait
certains aveux et que tout ce qu'on lui demandait ce soir-là, c'était de
circonstancier ce qu'il avait déjà dit. II s'attache donc une présomption très
forte que l'appelant pouvait se croire tenu, obligé, contraint de parler.

Le deuxième motif c'est que les deux
confessions sont si intimement liées, que l'exclusion de l'une entraîne celle
de l'autre, car le jury ne pouvait certes pas se détacher complètement de
l'impression que la lecture de la première pouvait avoir dans son esprit, dans
la considération du mobile du crime.

Comme troisième motif, je dirai, à la suite de
M. le juge Anglin dans l'affaire Sankey, que si l'interrogatoire que l'on fait
subir à un prévenu n'est pas, per se, illégal, il faut, d'autre part, bien
s'assurer que la Couronne s'est acquittée de son 'obligation de prouver que les
aveux sont libres, nullement entachés d'une contrainte physique ou morale
quelconque. Et cette preuve, (ajoutait le juge en chef Anglin, ne peut
qu'exceptionnellement ressortir du seul fait du serment des officiers de police
que l'inculpé a parlé librement.

The murder occurred Thursday, May 29, 1947, at Lac
Castagnier about twenty-four miles from Amos in the Province of Quebec.

Detective Oggier arrived at Amos on Saturday, May 31st. He
acquainted himself with the information already gathered by the Provincial
Police and on Sunday he and Constable Lefebvre proceeded to Lac Castagnier. At
Mrs. Laplante's they found a number of people, including Boudreau. Detective
Oggier desired to question Boudreau ""sur ses allées et venues,"" and
""parce que j'avais des soupçons,"" and requested him to accompany them
to Amos. At Amos the coroner was communicated with and Boudreau detained at the
jail. On Monday morning, June 2nd, Detective-Sergeant Massue had Boudreau
brought into his office and there informed him 'that he was held as a material
witness. Boudreau said nothing when so informed and was taken back into
custody. In fact no questions were asked and no statement made by Boudreau
until Tuesday night, the reason for which is explained by Detective Oggier in
the course of his evidence:

Q. Vous avez pas jugé à propos de lui parler
de ses allées et venues?

R. Non, mon enquête était pas complète.

Q. Pourquoi pas commencer à le questionner?

R. J'avais pas assez d'informations sur la
cause et j'ai cru bon de continuer mon enquête.

Detective Oggier continued his inquiries at Lac Castagnier
and returned to Amos on Tuesday, June 3rd. That evening at about 8.30 Boudreau
was brought into the office of Detective-Sergeant Massue where Massue and
Oggier questioned him. No warning was given and the

[Page 279]

conversation lasted about an hour. The statements made by
Boudreau were in reply to questions, for the most part by Detective-Sergeant
Massue. Boudreau there admitted ownership of a 12 gun as well as a revolver and
told the police that he had left his home about midday on Tuesday, May 27th, to
go into the woods to check over his traps, and returned on Saturday, when he
heard of the murder of Laplante. He also stated that he had visited and worked
at Laplante's place. When questioned he admitted intimate relations with Mrs.
Laplante but when pressed with regard thereto ""il paraissait un peu
gêné.""

The officers acknowledged that his information relative to
his relations with Mrs. Laplante, apart from some details, but corroborated
that which they had already received. In fact as regards the entire interview
Oggier deposed that they had received no new information of consequence but
their suspicions were strengthened. As yet, however, they concluded that they
did not have sufficient to justify the laying of an information and complaint.

Boudreau, after making these verbal statements to the
officers, consented to make a statement in writing. Bacon, the secretary of the
provincial police, was called to take down the statement and when completed
Tessier, Deputy Prothonotary, was called. He ascertained that Boudreau could
read, handed to him a copy of the statement which he followed as Tessier read
it aloud. Boudreau thereafter signed it and pledged his oath thereto before
Tessier.

Detective Oggier returned on Wednesday and Thursday to Lac
Castagnier where he continued his investigation and returned again to Amos
Thursday evening about 8.00 or 8.30. He and Detective-Sergeant Massue had
further conversation and decided to again question Boudreau. Oggier's
own explanation is as follows:

R. On a décidé tous les deux ensemble. J'ai
rencontré le sergent Massue à son bureau et je lui ai fait part de mon enquête
additionnelle au Lac Castagnier et on a décidé de le faire venir, de le mettre
sur ses gardes et de voir s'il était décidé de nous donner d'autres
informations.

D. Vous croyiez avoir une preuve contre lui et
vous vouliez avoir une déclaration de lui?

R. Lui, parce que je voyais que sa premiére
déclaration était pas complète.

Boudreau was brought into Massue's office at about 11.00
o'clock that night and there remained until about 1.00 o'clock in the morning. On
this occasion prior to any

[Page 280]

questions being asked Massue warned Boudreau. As to why the
warning was given Massue deposed: ""Parce que nous étions plus convaincus
que le mardi soir."" Immediately he had given the warning Massue asked the
appellant ""s'il avait des informations nouvelles à nous donner."" Oggier deposed: ""Il s'est assis et il a pensé et il a commencé à
conter la même histoire que la fois d'avant."" He also deposed: ""Le
sergent Massue a posé plusieurs questions concernant les armes à feu et madame
Laplante."" The appellant's gun used in committing the murder, his
revolver and some cartridges were shown to him during this interview. The sack
and the box found near the scene of the murder may or may not have been shown
to him. It was at this interview that Boudreau stated:
""Messieurs, vous le savez pas combien que j'aime cette femme-là."" At
some time during the interview the appellant became and remained very nervous.
After about half an hour Massue left his office to obtain a glass of water. As to what happened in his absence Oggier deposed:

Je lui ai dit que j'avais vu son pére et sa
mère et là il a dit: ""J'aime autant vous le dire, c'est moi qui l'a
tué."" J'ai lâché un cri et j'ai dit: ""Viens t'en de suite.""

In reply to their further questions Boudreau gave them the
details of the murder and consented to give a written statement. Then, as on
Tuesday evening, Bacon was called, later Tessier, before whom the statement was
signed and appellant pledged his oath thereto.

The learned trial judge admitted the first statement in
evidence because, in his opinion, it did not implicate the appellant but was
rather exculpatory in character. It did contain an alibi and an admission that
appellant owned a · 12 gun. The greater part, however, described his relations
with Mrs. Laplante, from which the jury might well find the motive that
prompted the murder. In this aspect the statement implicated the appellant in
the commission of the offence.

If you have acts seriously tending, when reasonably viewed,
to establish motive for the commission of a crime, then there can be no doubt
that such evidence is admissible, not merely to prove intent, but to prove the
fact as well. Ped Duff, C.J. in The King v. Barbour 57.

See also Lord Atkinson in Rex v. Ball 58.

[Page 281]

Then when both statements are read together the alibi is but
a contradiction of his subsequent confession and to that extent is evidence
that would be prejudicial to the appellant should any question of credibility
arise in the mind of the jury. The learned trial judge, with respect,
misdirected himself as to the significance of this statement as evidence
against the appellant.

On Thursday evening Massue and Oggier again
had the appellant, who was still under arrest, brought into the former's
office, ""… de voir s'il était décidé de nous donner d'autres informations
… parce que je voyais que sa première déclaration était pas complète.""

The important issue the learned trial judge had to determine
was whether the confession ""J'aime autant vous le dire, c'est moi qui l'a
tué,"" made to Oggier was free and voluntary within the meaning of the
authorities. These words are not in the written statement that followed. It is,
however, what led up to the making of this confession that is vital in
determining the issue, was it freely and voluntarily made. If in determining
whether a confession is freely and voluntarily made the trial judge does not
misdirect himself in law his finding should be accepted by an Appellate Court.
It appears that in this case the learned trial judge, apart from his
misdirection with regard to the first statement already dealt with, has
misdirected himself in not considering the warning as given in relation to all
the circumstances leading up to the making of this confession, including those
before as well as those after the warning was given, and particularly as to
whether, under all the circumstances, the effect of the warning as given had
not been destroyed. It is the sufficiency of the warning under all the
circumstances, the association of or connection between the two statements and
the effect of the questions asked that are raised in the dissenting opinion of
Mr. Justice Bissonnette.

The oft-quoted statement of the law by Lord Sumner in Ibraham
v. Rex 59, reads as follows:

It has long been established as a positive rule of English
criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against
him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement,
in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice
or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority. The
principle is as old as Lord Hale.

[Page 282]

In the Ibrahim case the accused was in custody when
Major Barrett came up to him and without any thought of a prosecution asked,
""Why have you done such a senseless act?"" to which the accused
replied, ""some three or four days he has been abusing me; without a doubt
I killed him."" Nothing more was said and no warning or caution had been
given. This confession was held to have been freely and voluntarily made and
therefore 'admissible. In this connection it is important to observe the
remarks of Lord Sumner relative to the question as asked:

In truth, except that Major Barrett's words were formally a
question they appear to have been indistinguishable from an exclamation of
dismay on the part of a humane officer, alike concerned for the position of the
accused, the fate of the deceased, and the credit of the regiment and the
service.

In Rex v. Voisin 60, no
warning was given and yet the evidence was admissible. There the murdered party
had not been identified. The police had a parcel containing a portion of the
remains on which appeared the words ""Bladie Belgiam"". Several
persons, including the accused, were held for questioning. At the request of
the police the accused wrote the words ""Bladie Belgiam"" in
handwriting that resembled and spelling identical with that on the parcel. Lawrence,
J. at p. 94 stated:

In this case the appellant wrote these words quite
voluntarily. The mere facts that they were police officers, or that the words
were written at their request, or that he was being detained at Bow Street do
not make the writing inadmissible in evidence … if the writing had turned out
other than it did and other circumstances had not subsequently happened it is
certain that he, like others who were similarly detained, would have been
discharged.

In Prosko v. The King 61, the
accused was held in custody by the United States immigration officials who
explained to the accused that they were taking proceedings for his deportation
to Canada. The accused then said, ""I am as good as dead if you send me
over there."" A constable asked why and the accused in the course of his
explanation included the confession tendered and admitted at his trial. No
warning was given and yet the statement was held to be freely and voluntarily
made and admissible in evidence.

These cases are illustrative of the principle that the
statement must in every case be voluntary. The mere fact

[Page 283]

that the confession was made by one in custody in response
to a question by one in authority without a warning given does not make it
inadmissible.

Then there are the cases such as Rex v. Knight
& Thayre 62, where a detective after warning the
accused questioned him for nearly three hours. Throughout the first two hours
the accused denied any knowledge of the fraud but during the last hour made the
confession tendered as evidence. Channell, J. stated, at p. 714:

The questioning was continued for a very long period, the
man's denials were not accepted, and the impression conveyed by Shinner to the
prisoner's mind may well have been this: ""You will have to tell me that
you did this thing, because I shall not let you go till you do so."" This
certainly cannot be said to be making a statement voluntarily. It may well be
that an admission made immediately after a caution had been given by the person
in authority would be admissible, but it does not follow that a suspended
person can be cross-examined until the person putting the questions is
satisfied.

These cases emphasize that whether the warning has or has
not been given it must be determined under all the circumstances of each case
if in fact the statement has been freely and voluntarily made.

There has developed a rule of practice that when the police
or others1 in authority have either arrested the accused or made up
their minds that he is the party whom they will prosecute then before being
questioned he should be cautioned or warned in a manner that will explain his
position much as a justice of the peace or magistrate does to an accused at the
conclusion of the Crown's evidence at a preliminary inquiry under sec. 684(2).
In Gach v. The King 63, it was the view of the majority of
this Court that the warning under the circumstances of that case should have
been given. The general language used has been construed to effect a change in
the law. Rex v. Scory 64. The general language construed as
effecting a change in the law was unnecessary to that decision. Moreover, that
case does not purport to overrule Prosko v. The King, supra, nor
any of the cases in which a statement has been received as voluntary although
no warning had been given, nor does it purport to hold that a statement should
be held to be voluntary where the warning has been given. In each case the
confession must be affirmatively proven

[Page 284]

by the Crown to have been freely and voluntarily made before
it can be received in evidence. The fact a warning has been given as well as
its content is an important circumstance to be considered. The Queen v. Thompson
65.


The circumstances from the outset pointed to Boudreau and,
as the police stated, caused them to be suspicious that he had committed the
murder. He was taken into custody on Sunday but not questioned until Tuesday
evening, when in reply to their questions he explained that at the time of the
murder he was in the woods caring for his traps and did not hear of Laplante's
death until he returned Saturday morning. He admitted ownership of a .12
gun and his relations with Mrs. Laplante. The following Thursday evening the
appellant was again brought into Massue's office to see if he had decided to
give them further information and because, as Oggier stated, he did not think
his first statement was complete.

The events of Thursday evening in these circumstances cannot
be segregated from those of Tuesday evening. The questions asked on Tuesday
evening, his alibi, his admission to ownership of a .12 gun
and his relations with Mrs. Laplante, the reasons why he was again questioned
on Thursday evening, as well as the questions asked, and all the incidents of
that evening are important factors. At the outset Thursday evening appellant
was warned and immediately asked by Massue the question already stated,
""s'il avait des informations nouvelles à nous donner,"" which directed
the appellant's mind at once to what he had said Tuesday evening. Then what is
of the greatest importance in this issue—apart from this first question, the
showing of the equipment used in the commission of the murder to the appellant,
the reference to his parents, the fact that other questions relative to the gun
and his relations with Mrs. Laplante were asked, and the nervous condition of
the appellant—is the evidence does not disclose what further questions were
asked or what transpired in that office immediately prior to the appellant's
confession. The events prior to and of that evening, including the actual words
of the confession, ""J'aime autant vous le dire, c'est moi qui l'a
tué,"" were important factors in the circumstances.

[Page 285]

The passage already quoted by Lord Sumner in the Ibrahim case
is an indication of the importance of the nature and character of the actual
questions asked. The three authorities, Ibrahim, Voisin and Prosko,
supra, as well as Sankey v. The King 66, all
emphasize the importance of considering the details leading up to a confession.

I do not subscribe to the view pressed by counsel for the
appellant that the warning necessarily should have included such words as would
have informed the appellant that, notwithstanding that he had already made one
statement, no matter what it contained he need not now make another or any
statement. Had such words been included they, of course, would have been a
factor. It is not, however, desirable that separate and distinct requirements
should be specified designed to cover specific situations; rather the issue to
be determined should remain in all cases, was the confession freely and
voluntarily made. The existence of a previous statement and the circumstances
under which it had been made may well be important in determining the issue in
a particular case. It was important here because the same officers were present
on each occasion. Immediately the warning was given the question asked directed
the appellant's attention to his previous statement and appellant himself began
by repeating the same history he had related on Tuesday evening. It was from
this beginning on Thursday evening that events led up to the confession. A
warning under such circumstances, when already he had given information in reply
to questions and when immediately after the warning he is further questioned by
the same parties in a manner that directed his mind to the information already
given, is quite different in its effect from a warning given before any
questions are asked.

The events of the two evenings upon all the facts of this
case were intimately associated by the officers themselves as well as by the
appellant and cannot be separated in considering the admissibility of the
statements made on these respective occasions. The courts have under such
circumstances always insisted that such confessions be

[Page 286]

received with care and caution. The statement of Chief
Justice Anglin in Sankey v. The King, supra, at p. 441, is appropriate:

It should always be borne in mind that while, on the one
hand, questioning of the accused by the police, if properly conducted and after
warning duly given, will not per se render his statement inadmissible,
on the other hand, the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the court
that anything in the nature of a confession or statement procured from, the
accused while under arrest was voluntary always rests with the Grown. The
King v. Bellos 67; Prosko v. The King 68.
That burden can rarely, if ever, be discharged merely by proof that the giving
of the statement was preceded by the customary warning and an expression of
opinion on oath by the police officer, who obtained it, that it was made freely
and voluntarily.

The learned trial judge's misdirection relative to the first
statement caused him to eliminate and not to consider what transpired prior to
the warning on Thursday evening. That which took place after the warning should
have been placed before the learned trial judge in greater detail. As Chief
Justice Anglin stated in Sankey v. The King, supra, at p. 441:

We think (that the police officer who obtained that
statement should have fully disclosed all that took place on each of the
occasions when he ""interviewed"" the prisoner …

The learned trial judge in proceeding to find 'that the
Crown had discharged the onus of proof and established that the statement was
freely and voluntarily made without these further details, in particular the
questions asked, the incidents surrounding the showing of the equipment used in
the commission of the murder, as well as all the other incidents of that half
hour, constituted a failure to direct himself as to that caution and care with
which evidence in such cases should be scrutinized.

The appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Malicious prosecution—Malice—Reasonable
and probable cause—Evidence—Judge's charge—Misdirection—Criminal Code  s. 542 —British Columbia Supreme Court Act R.S.C. 1936, c. 56, s. 60.

In an action for malicious prosecution, the judge's charge
amounted to misdirection, when, after properly saying that a want of reasonable
and probable cause was a circumstance from which the jury might infer malice,
he concluded that if malice was to be found at all in this case it was not
because of lack of reasonable and probable cause, although, in addition to some
evidence from which the jury might have inferred malice, there was also
evidence upon which the jury might have found want of reasonable and probable
cause.

Brown v. Hawkes (1891) 2 Q.B. 718 referred to.

APPEAL from the decision of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] dismissing (Smith J.A. dissenting) appellant's
appeal from the decision of Macfarlane J. dismissing an action for malicious
prosecution.

Sydney Pickles in person for the appellant.

R. D. Harvey K.C. for the
respondent.

[Page 240] 

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

LOCKE J.:—This is an appeal by
the plaintiff in an action for malicious prosecution from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] dismissing his appeal from a judgment of Macfarlane,
J. by which, after findings made by a jury, the action was dismissed. In the
Court of Appeal Sydney Smith, J.A. dissented and would have directed a new
trial.

The defendants, with the
exception of the defendant Weeks, are the executive officers of the Victoria
Branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Weeks is
employed by the Victoria Branch of the Society as an inspector and on February 19, 1947,
laid an information charging the plaintiff and his employee, one Longdon, with
having wantonly neglected to provide proper care to a sheep, thereby causing
unnecessary suffering. The charge was laid under sec. 542  of the Criminal
Code  and the magistrate issued a summons. On March 6, 1947, the appellant
appeared, represented by counsel, and counsel instructed by the Victoria Branch
of the Society appeared for the prosecution and obtained leave from the
magistrate to withdraw this charge and to substitute the following charge
against the appellant alone:—

That Sydney Pickles, between
the 27th day of January, 1947, and the 4th day of February, 1947, in the
Municipality of the District of Saanich, in the County of Victoria, being the
owner of four sheep, namely, one sheep destroyed on or about the 3rd day of
February, 1947, at Sunstead Farm by Inspector Weeks of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and three others found dead there by the said
Weeks on the same day, did unlawfully cause unnecessary suffering by
unreasonably omitting to care for such animals contrary to the Criminal Code .

At the conclusion of the evidence
for the prosecution this charge was dismissed. The evidence taken at this
hearing was made part of the record in the action and it is quite clear that no
other disposition of the matter could properly have been made.

As, in my opinion, there should
be a new trial, it is inadvisable that there should be any extended comment on
the evidence adduced at the hearing. Briefly stated, the facts were that
following an anonymous report received on February 3, 1947,
by the defendant Florence G. Barr, the corresponding secretary of the Victoria
Branch, that the

[Page 241] 

sheep on the farm of the
appellant in the Municipality of Saanich were in bad shape, Weeks in company with
an assistant inspector named Hamer was sent to the farm to investigate. They
found, according to their evidence, a flock of about a hundred sheep of which,
according to Hamer, all but ten or twelve were in good shape. In addition, they
found two dead sheep and a dead lamb in or near the barn and in the field
nearby a sheep lying on its side struggling and evidently in an extremity. The
appellant who lived in Victoria was not present but, with Longdon's consent, the inspectors
shot the sheep and a postmortem performed by a veterinary surgeon on the
following day disclosed that the animal was suffering from an infestation of
worms in its stomach and small intestines and fatty degeneration of the liver.
Certain further inquiries were made by the inspectors and written reports
submitted to a meeting of the members of the Executive on February 4, on which
date a resolution was passed instructing that the opinion of one McIntyre,
described in the resolution as a sheep expert, and that of Mr. C. L. Harrison,
the city prosecutor for Victoria, be obtained. A further report of the
veterinary surgeon made to the appellant on the day following the visit of the
inspectors to the farm, and a copy of which was made available to them, recommended
that the worming of the flock was necessary but, because of the inclement
weather, it would not be advisable to do so at the time and in the meantime
advised giving the animals free access to phenotiazine mixed with salt. On
February 12, following a further report from the defendant Weeks, the minutes
disclose that ""it was decided to lay a charge against Mr. Pickles in
regard to one sheep found in a suffering and dying condition."" It was not,
however, until the 17th of February that the defendant Weeks and Florence G.
Barr laid the matter before Mr. Harrison who gave evidence that, after
considering the facts and particularly noting that there was nothing to
indicate that the appellant knew anything about the sheep being ill which had
been found lying in the field and had been destroyed and that the veterinarian
had said it would not be apparent to the farmer that the sheep was sick until
it laid down to die, he advised them not to lay a charge without consulting
their solicitor and 

[Page 242]

getting advice on it and told
them that he (Harrison) would not lay the charge or recommend that it be laid.
On the day following, however, Weeks saw Harrison and showed him an information which had been
prepared charging the appellant with wantonly neglecting to provide proper care
to a sheep, thereby causing unnecessary suffering. On being asked by Mr.
Harrison whether he had got the advice of their lawyer Weeks replied in the
negative and was then advised not to swear the information. The charge was,
however, laid by Weeks on February 20 and the matter thereafter dealt with as
above stated.

It should be said that there was
a conflict as to what had actually transpired between Mr. Harrison and these
two defendants on February 17th and in his discussion with Weeks on the day
following. According to Mrs. Barr, Mr. Harrison had told them to go ahead and
prosecute and to have Mr. Harvey, K.C. handle the prosecution. According to the
defendant Weeks, Mr. Harrison had told them to go ahead and that when he had
shown the latter the information which had been drafted he had approved of it.
Upon this evidence the jury found that Mr. Harrison's evidence was true and
that the statements which the defendant Weeks and Florence G. Barr claimed to
have been made to them by him were not made. To these findings, however, a
rider was added to which further reference will be made.

In charging the jury the learned
trial judge informed them that he proposed to ask them to make certain findings
of fact and that, dependent upon the nature of their findings, he would decide
the question as to whether there was a want of reasonable and probable cause.
After reviewing the evidence the learned judge said in part:—

I think those, gentlemen,
are the things to which I will direct your attention when you come to consider
the questions I will put to you, and upon which I will direct you as to my
finding, as to reasonable and probable cause. If you find that Mr. Harrison
warned him not to take this prosecution without getting the advice of Counsel,
and that he did so without getting it, that evidence goes to show that they had
not reasonable cause.

On the other hand, you have
the evidence of Mr. McIntyre. Did Mr. McIntyre advise him that there was
evidence of neglect, or just what was the nature of his comments in connection
with that? Were they conditional only, or were they such as a reasonable person
would act upon in coming to the decision that the charge should be laid? Was it


[Page 243]

evidence of neglect, the
evidence of the existence of a state of circumstances which would reasonably
lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man placed in the position of Weeks,
to come to the conclusion that the person charged was probably guilty of the
crime accused?

That is the extent of the
obligation, and I am asking you questions so I can find out whether or not that
is true. I am going to ask you a question with regard to Dr. Bruce, as to what
he told them, and with regard to Colonel Evans. When I have put before you
those questions and you have answered them, if you answer that Dr. Bruce's
evidence is the evidence to be accepted, that Mr. Harrison's evidence is the
evidence to be accepted, that Colonel Evans' is the evidence to be accepted
then I would instruct you that my verdict would be that the plaintiff has
established that there was want of reasonable and probable cause.

If, on the other hand, you
think that Mr. Weeks' evidence where it is contradicted by those other men, is
the evidence to be accepted, and that Mrs. Barr's evidence is the evidence to
be accepted; and that Mr. McIntyre gave them a firm opinion that there was
neglect under the circumstances, and in your opinion the circumstances were
properly described to him, then I would advise you that the plaintiff has not
satisfied the onus that was on him.

Upon the jury retiring a
discussion ensued between the learned trial judge and counsel as to certain
aspects of the charge and the jury was recalled. In the further charge then
delivered the following passage appears:—

Now I mentioned malice in my
charge this morning. There is a provision in law that you may infer malice from
want of reasonable and probable cause, but you are by no means bound to do so.
In determining the question of malice, the jury may, but are not bound to, find
malice in the absence of reasonable and probable cause. You are not obliged to
find malice, although both must be found in order that the plaintiff may
succeed; unless he proves both lack of reasonable and probable cause and
malice, he fails in the action. You may infer malice from some lack of
reasonable and probable cause, but there is evidence here directed to the
question of malice, which I have referred to in my charge, and I do not think
that question needs to arise here. If you find malice at all, you will find it,
not because of lack of reasonable and probable cause in this case, but because
of the fact that the prosecution was undertaken from motives other than those I
have described as proper.

and it was with this final
instruction that the jury retired and arrived at their verdict.

The questions asked and the
answers made were as follows:

Question 1: ""Were the
statements which Mr. Harrison says he made to Inspector Weeks and Mrs Barr in
fact made to them?"" Answer: ""Yes.""

Question 2: ""Were the
statements which Inspector Weeks and Mrs. Barr say that Mr. Harrison made to
them in fact made to them?"" Answer: ""No."" Rider: ""We feel
that there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of Mr. Harrison's
instructions.""

Question 3: ""Did Mr.
Bruce make the statements which Weeks attributed to him on February 7th?""
Answer: ""Yes.""

[Page 244]

Question 4: ""Were the
statements attributed to Colonel Evans by Mrs. Barr and Inspector Weeks made to
them respectively by him?"" Answer: ""Yes.""

Question 5: ""Did Mr.
McIntyre give his opinion that there was neglect as a final opinion on the
facts stated by Weeks?"" Answer: ""No.""

Question 6: ""Did Mr.
McIntyre express the opinion subject to confirmation after he had seen the
sheep?"" Answer: ""Yes.""

Question 7: ""Was the
evidence on which Weeks acted reasonably apparent to him to be unreliable or
incomplete?"" Answer: ""No.""

Question 8: ""Did Weeks
honestly believe, taking into consideration all the statements as you find them
made on the evidence in this case, that Pickles was probably guilty of the
offence charged?"" Answer: ""Yes.""

Question 9: ""Did Weeks
lay the Information or either of them maliciously, that is, from any motive
other than an honest desire to bring a person (that is the plaintiff) whom he
believed to be a guilty person to justice?"" Answer: ""No.""

Question 10: ""Did any
of the remaining defendants authorize the prosecution of the plaintiff
maliciously?"" Answer: ""No.""

Question 11: ""If so,
which defendant?"" No answer.

Question 12:
""Regardless to your answers to the above questions, give total damages
suffered by the plaintiff: (a) 'for Special damages.' "" Answer:
""$403.94."" (b) ""for General damages."" Answer:
""Nil.""

As to the rider attached to the
answer to the second question it must, in my opinion, be rejected. It had not
been suggested either by the defendant Florence G. Barr or by the defendant
Weeks that they had misunderstood the advice given to them by Mr. Harrison on
February 17th; rather had they both attributed to him statements which the jury
found as a fact had not been made. There was in truth no possibility of
misunderstanding the advice given by Mr. Harrison to these two defendants or
that given by him to Weeks on the following day. The suggestion made in the
rider that there was a misunderstanding contradicts the jury's findings in
Question 1, that the statements which Mr. Harrison said he had made were in
truth made, since those statements were incapable of misinterpretation. The
jury had also found that the statements of Weeks and Mrs. Barr that Mr.
Harrison had told them ""to go ahead"" were untrue. As these findings
were made in response to direct questions, the rider which is inconsistent with
the answers should be rejected.

As to Questions 3 to 6 inclusive,
the learned trial judge had informed the jury that if they accepted the
evidence of Doctor Bruce, Colonel Evans and Mr. Harrison he would instruct them
that he would decide that the plaintiff had established that there was want of
reasonable and probable

[Page 245]

cause. He had said further that
if they believed the evidence of Weeks and Mrs. Barr in preference to that of
Bruce, Evans and Harrison, and if they found that McIntyre gave them a firm
opinion that there was neglect under the circumstances, he would advise them
that the plaintiff had not proven a want of reasonable and probable cause. The
jury, however, as has been pointed out, accepted the evidence of Mr. Harrison
and found that McIntyre had only expressed his opinion subject to confirmation
after he had seen the sheep, while accepting the evidence of Weeks and Mrs.
Barr where it contradicted that of Evans and Bruce. This contingency was not
provided for in the charge so that if in fact the jury interpreted the
concluding portion of the judge's charge as a direction that they were to
consider whether there was a want of reasonable and probable cause in answering
Questions 9 and 10 which were directed to malice, they were without any
instructions as to whether a want of reasonable and probable cause had been
shown. That question was one for the trial judge to determine and in the
situation created by the answers made to Questions 1 and 6 inclusive the jury
acted without instructions. In Brown v. Hawkes [3],
Cave, J. said in part:—

There may be such plain want
of reasonable and probable cause that the jury may come to the conclusion that
the prosecutor could not honestly have believed in the charge he made and in
that case want of reasonable and probable cause is evidence of malice.

It is impossible in the present
case to know whether this aspect of the matter was even considered by the jury
or, if it was, upon what basis they proceeded. This, I think, is a fatal
objection to the verdict and the judgment entered.

If it is wrong to assume that the
jury understood from the concluding portion of the charge that a want of
reasonable and probable cause was a circumstance from which they might infer
malice and accepted the concluding part of the direction that, if malice was to
be found at all, it was not because of lack of reasonable and probable cause,
there was misdirection. The plaintiff had, it is true, adduced some other
evidence from which the jury might have inferred that the prosecution had been
initiated

[Page 246]

maliciously but, in addition to
this, there was evidence upon which the plaintiff might properly contend that
there was a plain want of reasonable and probable cause.

The appeal should be allowed with
costs and a new trial directed. No objection was made to that portion of the
judge's charge which, in my view, was misdirection, though counsel for the
plaintiff had in the earlier discussion made it clear that he contended that
from a want of reasonable and probable cause malice could be inferred. Having
in mind the provisions of sec. 60 of the Supreme Court Act, cap. 56,
R.S.B.C. 1936, and in the exercise of the powers vested in this Court there
should be no costs to either party in the Court of Appeal. The costs of the
first trial should be in the discretion of the presiding judge at the new
trial.

Appeal allowed with
costs; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Trial judge sitting alone
acquitting on reasonable doubt at close of Crown’s case—No election by accused
as to adducing evidence—Appeal on question of law—Criminal Code  ss. 839 , 944 , 1013(4) .

The accused, on a charge of unlawful
possession of a drug, was tried by a judge sitting without a jury under Part
XVIII of the Criminal

[Page 173]

Code. At the close of the case for the Crown,
the accused, before making his election to call or not to call evidence, moved
to dismiss for lack of “sufficient evidence which could legally and properly
support a conviction”. The trial judge thereupon dismissed the charge because
of reasonable doubt arising upon the evidence of the Crown. The majority in the
Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal.

Held: The
trial judge having the same power as to acquitting or convicting as a jury and
no more, could only have decided whether or not there was evidence upon which
the jury might convict. The question of reasonable doubt did not arise at that
stage.

Held: In the
light of the evidence which the Crown submitted, the case could not have been
withdrawn from the jury nor could it have been submitted to the jury until it
was known that the evidence had been completed.

v. The King 82 Can. C.C. 240 and The King v. Olsen 4
C.R. (Can.) 65 referred to.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing (Roach J.A. dissenting) the appeal of the Crown from the decision of
Parker J. dismissing the charge against respondent for unlawful possession of a
drug.

N.L. Mathews K.C. for the appellant.

N. Borins K.C. for the respondent.

KERWIN J.:—For the reasons given by Mr. Justice
Roach1, the appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

TASCHEREAU J.:—I agree that this appeal should
be allowed and a new trial directed.

The judgment of Rand, Kellock and Locke JJ. was
delivered by

KELLOCK J.:—This appeal should, in my opinion,
be allowed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Roach[2] in his dissenting judgment in the court
below. The correctness of that judgment is emphasized by the position taken in
this court by counsel for the respondent who contended that, had he failed in
the application made by him to the trial judge, he considered that he still had
the right, should

[Page 174]

he so elect, to call evidence on behalf of the
defence. His argument, as presented to this court therefore, involved the
proposition that, at the close of the case for the prosecution, the trial judge
had the right to try the case on the evidence adduced by the Crown, and if he
came to the conclusion not that he could, but that he would convict, then there
should be another trial upon that evidence together with any further evidence
called on behalf of the accused. Needless to say, no authority was cited
in support of this contention.

In Metropolitan Rly. Co. v. Jackson[3], Lord Cairns said:

The Judge has a certain duty to discharge,
and the jurors have another and a different duty. The Judge has to say whether
any facts have been established by evidence from which negligence may be reasonably
inferred; the jurors have to say whether, from those facts, submitted to them,
negligence ought to be inferred. It is, in my opinion, of the greatest
importance in the administration of justice that these separate functions
should be maintained, and should be maintained distinct.

This statement of the law is, of course, not
limited to civil actions. It is equally applicable to a criminal as to a civil
proceeding; Regina v. Lloyd[4];
The King v. Hopper[5].

The learned trial judge did not, in my opinion,
keep these functions distinct. The fact that he was sitting without a jury made
no difference. He had the same power as to acquitting or convicting as a jury
would have had; section 835. He had no additional power. By
section 944(1) it is provided that if an accused person is defended by
counsel, such counsel “shall”, at the end of the case for the prosecution,
declare whether or not he intends to adduce evidence on behalf of the accused
and if he does not thereupon announce such intention, counsel for the
prosecution may make his address.

The learned trial judge, upon the conclusion of
the case for the Crown asked counsel for the defence if he were calling any
evidence. That question was not answered, but a motion to dismiss for lack of
“sufficient evidence which could legally and properly support a
conviction” was made. It is clear, I think, that no other application

[Page 175]

could have been made at that stage in the
absence of an election on the part of the defence to call or not to call
evidence. Had a jury been present, the learned trial judge could have done no
more, on the application of the defence, than have decided whether or not there
was evidence upon which the jury might convict; The King v. Comba[6]. Had he ruled adversely to the Crown in the
present case he would clearly, in my opinion, have been wrong in law in the
light of the evidence which the Crown had submitted; Girvin v. The
King[7]. He
would have had no right, as he in fact did, to proceed to weigh the evidence
until all the evidence was in. The decisions are uniform.

In Rex v. Perreault[8], counsel for the defence moved for a
non-suit at the conclusion of the case for the Crown and before declaring
that he had no witnesses, on the ground that a fact material to the Crown’s
case had not been proved. The Crown thereupon moved to reopen its case to
supply this lack. Langlais J. in the Superior Court of Quebec said at p. 237:

Counsel for the defence could have declared
that he had no evidence to offer and then he would have raised this question of
lack of an essential element in his pleading (argument),… and then I would have
been obliged to declare to the jury that this element was lacking.

In Perry v. The King[9], in the Supreme Court of Prince Edward
Island, on appeal from a summary conviction, Campbell C.J. said at p. 242:

On the conclusion of the evidence for the
respondent, counsel for the appellant has moved that the appeal be allowed, as
no prima facie case of guilt had been proved against the appellant. No
authorities were cited to indicate just what cogency of proof is required to
establish a prima facie case at that stage, and I have not run across
any case in which the point was settled. I presume, therefore, that, in order
to put the accused on his defence, a Judge or Magistrate sitting alone need
find only such evidence as would entitle the Crown, in a jury case, to have the
facts left to the decision of the jury. In other words, the criterion would be
whether the evidence is such as a jury might, in the absence of contradiction
or explanation, reasonably and properly convict upon. This view is supported by
the wording of the Code, s. 726, which provides that the Justice shall consider
the whole matter after hearing what each party has to say and the witnesses and
evidence adduced. The Justice or Judge, therefore, apparently does not exercise
the function of a jury until both sides have completed their case; and the
question of proof beyond reasonable doubt does not arise at this stage.

[Page 176]

I do not think, in view of section 944 ,
made applicable to the case at bar by section 839 , that the lack of any
inference to be drawn from section 726 affects the relevancy of the above
decision.

Again in Rex v. Olsen[10], also an appeal from a summary conviction,
a magistrate had dismissed the charge at the conclusion of the case for the
Crown without calling upon the defence. The case, like that at bar,
involved a charge under sec. 4(1) (d) of the Opium and
Narcotic Drug Act, 1929. The British Columbia Court of Appeal unanimously
set aside the acquittal. O’Halloran J.A. said at p. 66:

I am of opinion, with respect, that the
Crown in the circumstances here made out a case warranting conviction in the
absence of any defence which might have been disclosed if the defence had been
called upon. But the learned magistrate dismissed the case without calling upon
the defence. With respect the case ought not to have been dismissed as it was.
I must conclude there was no proper trial in the true legal sense.

To borrow the language of Viscount Sankey, L.C.,
in Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions[11]:

… it is not till the end of the evidence
that a verdict can properly be found…

In the words of section 944(2) it is only
when all the evidence is concluded that counsel for the defence, or the
accused himself, as the case may be, may sum up the evidence. The public has an
interest in the proper trial of accused persons and I do not think that the
fact that counsel for the Crown at the trial apparently failed to realize at
the time that the learned trial judge was going beyond the application made to
him should, in the circumstances, be allowed to influence the result, particularly
in view of the fact that the position of the respondent in this court, as
already mentioned, is that the stage had never been reached when he had elected
whether he would or would not call evidence. Had the question put to him with
respect to that matter been insisted upon, and evidence been called, the case
could only have been disposed of on the whole of the evidence; The King v.
Joseph Power[12]; Rex
v. Lenton[13].

The case on the Crown’s evidence could not have
been withdrawn from the jury nor could it have been submitted

[Page 177]

to the jury until it was known that the evidence
had been completed. Counsel for the respondent tells us he does not yet know
whether or not the evidence was complete. In my opinion there must be a new
trial.

Appeal allowed; new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Arson—Accessory—Aiding
and abetting—Active part—Presence during commission of crime—Failure to leave
or protest—Charge to jury—Duty to review evidence—Comments and suggestions by
trial judge—Criminal Code , ss. 69 , 511 , 1014(2) .

Appellant was charged with having set fire to a school. At
trial before a jury, the contention of the Crown was that (a) he had
actually set the fire, or (b) he had formed a common intent with one Bryan
to burn the school, or (c) he had aided, abetted, counselled or procured
 Bryan to set the fire pursuant to section 69  of the Criminal Code . On the
offence of aiding and abetting, there was evidence that they had a conversation
respecting the burning of schools, that he drove with Bryan to the scene of the
crime, that some gasoline was purchased and that accused made statements in a
restaurant to the effect that they were out to burn schools. Although accused
was there when the crime was committed, he alleged that he was unaware of the
intention of Bryan to fire the building, took no active part and remained in
the car. The majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction.

[Page 157]

Held, Kellock and Locke JJ. dissenting, that the trial
judge's charge, as a whole, properly directed the jury that they must find some
act of participation on the part of the accused before they can find him guilty
of aiding and abetting.

Held also, that the trial judge has a duty to review
the evidence in relation to the issues and he has the privilege of making such
comments and suggestions as will be of assistance to the jury, provided that he
does not seek to impose his views upon nor in any way relieve the jury of their
responsibility to find the facts.

Per Kellock and Locke JJ. (dissenting): The portion of
the charge dealing with aiding and abetting tended to lead the jury to
understand that mere presence at the scene of the crime, the failure of the
accused to get out of the car earlier in the evening when his companion had
made some general statements to the effect that he approved the burning of
schools and his failure to telephone the police, constituted aiding and
abetting and there should be a new trial.

Mohun's case (1693) Holt K.B. 479; Reg. v. Coney
(1882) 8 Q.B.D. 534 and Rex v. O'Donnell (1917) 12 Cr. App. R.

APPEAL from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing (O'Halloran J.A.
dissenting) the appellant's appeal from his conviction, at trial before Manson
J. and a jury, on a charge of having set fire to a school.

The material facts of the case
and the questions at issue are stated in the above head note and in the
judgments now reported.

Thomas F. Hurley for the
appellant.

George R. McQuarrie for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice
and Kerwin and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:—

ESTEY J.:—The appellant and Nick
Bryan were charged jointly with having set fire to the Queen Elizabeth School
House on Lulu Island in New Westminster, January 31, 1948,
contrary to sec. 511  of the Criminal Code . At their trial before a jury, after
a number of witnesses had been heard, the learned trial Judge directed that the
case be continued against the appellant only and that of Bryan
adjourned. The appellant was convicted and upon his appeal to the Court of
Appeal in British Columbia the majority of the learned Judges in that Court
affirmed the 

[Page 158]

conviction. Mr. Justice
O'Halloran dissented and by virtue thereof the appellant appeals to this Court
under sec. 1023  of the Criminal Code .

The evidence left no doubt but
that either appellant or Bryan set fire to the Queen Elizabeth School. There
was evidence upon which the jury might have found that the appellant actually
set the fire. However, the main contention of the Crown was that appellant and
Bryan had formed a common intention, either in Vancouver or prior to the
setting of the fire, to burn one or more school houses; or alternatively, if
that common intention did not exist and Bryan set the fire that the appellant
had aided, abetted, counselled or procured Bryan to set the fire and was,
therefore, under the provisions of sec. 69  of the Criminal Code , a party to the
offence.

The evidence established that the
Queen Elizabeth School was set on fire about 11.30 Saturday night, January 31,
1948, by either the appellant or Nick Bryan. These two had been together from
the time they met in Vancouver, at the office where Nick Bryan was employed, at
about 4.40 that afternoon, until they were apprehended in Bryan's
automobile a few minutes after the burning of the Queen
Elizabeth School. The contention on behalf of the appellant was that
he knew Bryan only as a real estate agent and that they had set out from
Vancouver at about 8.45 that night in order that Bryan might show him some
properties in or near New Westminster that the appellant might accept at least
in part payment for a rooming house, which he deposed he owned in Vancouver and
which he had listed for sale with Bryan; that he was not in any way a party to
setting fire to the school house.

Appellant in giving evidence on
his own behalf stated that on the way to New
 Westminster they stopped at a filling
station where Bryan purchased a can of gasoline. This can, when
purchased at the filling station, was by the attendant. placed just behind the
front seat in Bryan's two-door coach while the appellant was sitting in
the front seat. He deposed that he did not see that can so placed nor the
bottle of motor oil that the attendant said he saw either appellant or Bryan pass
over the front seat. Eventually Bryan's car was parked opposite the Queen
Elizabeth School, the can of gasoline purchased at the filling
station

[Page 159]

taken therefrom and the fire set.
Hamilton, driving a taxi with three passengers, came up in time to see the party
who set the fire go from the school house, get into the automobile and drive
away at an increasing speed. Hamilton pursued them and notified the police.

The issues were defined and the
evidence reviewed in relation thereto by the learned trial Judge. The
objections to his charge in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice O'Halloran
are set out in six paragraphs of the formal judgment.

First, that the charge confused
in the minds of the jury the evidence relating to the appellant as the one who
actually set the fire and that of one aiding and abetting, as the learned trial
Judge treated the case against the appellant as if it were one of common
intention from the outset and that it did not matter whether Bryan or the
appellant set the fire. The evidence upon which the jury might have found the
appellant guilty of having actually set the fire was very short and will be
more fully discussed later. It was reviewed by the learned trial Judge but not
in any way did he relate it to or discuss it in relation to the appellant as
one who was acting pursuant to a common intent (although if he did set the fire
it might have been in carrying out a common intent), or as one who aided and
abetted. More than once the learned trial Judge made it plain that the
appellant could be found guilty as one aiding, abetting, counselling and
procuring only if they found that Bryan actually set the fire. It is possible in explaining
and discussing aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring that the learned
trial Judge interposed remarks relative to the main contention of the Crown,
that the appellant and Bryan were acting pursuant to a common intent, with such
emphasis that the jury may have concluded, in order to find the appellant did
aid, abet, counsel or procure, they must find that he had a common intention
with Bryan up to and at the time of the setting of the fire. Instructions to
that effect would be in error. In order to find the appellant guilty of aiding,
abetting, counselling or procuring, it is only necessary to show that he
understood what was taking place and by some act on his part encouraged or
assisted in the attainment thereof. Re Bernard

[Page 160]

Albert Kupferberg [1]. In so
far, however, as such confusion may have been created in this regard, it
favoured rather than prejudiced the appellant.

The second ground is that the
learned trial Judge did not put to the jury the weaknesses of the evidence of
the Crown witnesses relative to the appellant starting the fire instead of Bryan. The
only evidence indicating that the appellant had set the fire was that of the
two ladies in the back seat of Hamilton's taxi. They said the man who ran from the school
entered the automobile on the side opposite to that of the driver, or the side
upon which appellant was seated. The learned trial Judge in referring to this
evidence not only stated that it was suggested one of them had made a contrary
statement at the preliminary hearing, although that was not proved, but pointed
out that Hamilton's evidence was to the effect that the man had entered the
driver's side, and commented favourably on his credibility. He also referred to
the other man in the taxi who, while he had seen the man running, had not
observed upon which side he entered the automobile. It would appear that the
learned trial Judge not only indicated the possible weakness in the Crown's
evidence, but rather emphasized Hamilton's contrary evidence.

The third ground of dissent is on
the basis of the omission of the learned trial Judge to instruct the jury that
mere passive presence is not aiding and abetting. In discussing the meaning of
aiding and abetting the learned Judge plainly indicated that in order to find
the appellant guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring they must
find that he took some active part. He emphasized this when dealing with the
defence, which at one point he summarized as follows: ""I'm not guilty. I
hadn't anything whatever to do with this. The other man was wholly responsible.
I was just an unwilling passenger."" Other statements to like effect in his
charge are quoted in dealing with the fifth ground. In referring to a slightly
different matter, but also important in this connection, the learned trial
Judge pointed out that the Crown directed the attention of the jury to the
active acts rather than to the mere acts of omission on appellant's part. Mere
presence does not constitute aiding and abetting but presence under

[Page 161]

certain circumstances may itself
be evidence thereof. Mohun's Case [2];
Reg. v. Young [3]; The
Queen v. Coney [4]. In
this case the appellant admitted and explained his presence. If the jury
accepted his explanation as above summarized then the effect of the learned
Judge's direction was that they should find the appellant not guilty. In
determining whether they would accept his explanation the jury would properly
take into account all the facts, including the conversations relative to
burning schools, first at the office in Vancouver and later in the evening, the
protests and threats which the appellant deposed he had made to Bryan, as well
as his assuring Bryan a short time before the fire was set that if the latter
did anything wrong he would tell the truth. Under the circumstances of this
case the jury would take into account appellant's conduct in relation to the
other events during the evening and it was the duty of the learned trial Judge
in reviewing the evidence to place before the jury both the contentions of the
appellant and of the Crown. If appellant's explanation was not believed by the
jury there was evidence in addition to his mere presence upon which they might
well conclude that he was guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring.
In this regard the charge to the jury read as a whole was to the effect that
before the jury could find the appellant guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling
or procuring they must be satisfied of some act of participation on his part.
In relation to the evidence and the issues the charge in this regard is not
subject to exception on the part of the appellant.

The fourth ground of dissent is
based upon the contention that the learned trial Judge neglected to charge the
jury that if they accepted the evidence of the appellant he was entitled to be
acquitted. These precise words were not used but the charge as a whole, and
particularly those portions contrasting the evidence of appellant with that of
the Crown, would leave but one impression upon the minds of the jury that if
they believed appellant's evidence to the effect that he was throughout
concerned only with a real estate deal and was but a passenger who never
realized what Bryan had in mind, then and in that event

[Page 162]

he was not guilty of the offence
as charged. In this regard it is appropriate to quote the language of the Lord
Chief Justice speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Stoddart
[5]:

Every summing-up must be
regarded in the light of the conduct of the trial and the questions which have
been raised by the counsel for the prosecution and for the defence
respectively. This Court does not sit to consider whether this or that phrase
was the best that might have been chosen, or whether a direction which has been
attacked might have been fuller or more conveniently expressed, or whether such
topics which might have been dealt with on other occasions should be
introduced. This Court sits here to administer justice and to deal with valid
objections to matters which may have led to a miscarriage of justice.

The charge upon this point left
no doubt in the minds of the jury that they were to find the appellant not
guilty unless they were satisfied that he either set the fire, acted throughout
with a common intent or aided, abetted, counselled or procured Bryan to commit
the offence.

Counsel for the appellant at the
hearing of this appeal particularly stressed the fifth ground of dissent—to the
effect that the charge as a whole suggested the guilt of appellant, discounted
his evidence, minimized his real defence and did not state his contention in a
way that brought out the real force and effect of his defence. The learned
trial Judge defined the issues and reviewed the evidence in relation thereto.
He reviewed the appellant's evidence and concisely stated the contention of the
defence. In reviewing the latter's evidence he pointed out that as a witness
the appellant was an interested party and discussed his evidence in relation to
what might be expected under all of the circumstances. The learned Judge was
not apt in one of his comparisons, but he went on immediately to state:
""Just because this man has an interest, you must not for a moment say his
story is untrue. It may be true, that is to say, apart from other
circumstances, the fact that he tells it doesn't render it untrue."" He
reviewed the history of the appellant as he, himself, had stated it, which set
forth a commendable record, including a reference to the fact that the
appellant did not adhere to the Dukhobor faith and was not a member of the Sons
of Freedom. The learned trial Judge concluded his review: ""Now, there is
the summary of it. 'I had no common intent with Bryan to burn this school. I did
not take any active part in

[Page 163]

setting a fire.' That is the
defence."" Then when giving further instructions, he again stated that the
appellant says: ""I'm entirely innocent. True, I was there all the time and
I made these statements in the restaurant and all that, but despite all that, I
wasn't in it. I was just an unwilling spectator of what occurred.""
Appellant's evidence was directed to two main points (1) Bryan set the
fire and (2) that appellant did not realize the possibility of Bryan setting
a fire and was in no way a party thereto. The foregoing summary briefly,
effectively and forcefully emphasizes the real defence. The learned trial Judge
unfortunately did state that the Crown could not have called Bryan as a
witness, but here again he went on to point out that they were not trying
Bryan, that Preston alone was before the Court and made it plain that it was
only the evidence before them that the jury could take cognizance of.

Counsel for the appellant took
exception to the fact that the learned trial Judge expressed the view that
Bryan in making the statement at appellant's rooming house that ""the house
is going to be sold tonight"" in the presence of Mrs. Dodderidge sounded
like liquor and thereby depreciated that evidence to the prejudice of the
appellant. The evidence disclosed that they had been drinking whiskey and beer
and this comment on the part of the learned trial Judge was but an expression
of his view, which the jury need not have accepted.

It is the duty of a trial Judge
to review the evidence in relation to the issues and it is his privilege to
make such comments and suggestions as will be of assistance to the jury in
arriving at their verdict, always subject to this, that he must not seek to
impose his views upon nor in any way relieve the jury of their responsibility
to find the facts. Rex v. O'Donnell [6].
Throughout he impressed upon the jury that the facts were to be found by them
and that in so doing they should not act upon any view he might express unless they
agreed therewith, and further, that if he neglected to mention any portion of
the evidence they should, nevertheless, take it into consideration in arriving
at their verdict.

The sixth ground of dissent is to
the effect that the learned trial Judge did not instruct the jury that the

[Page 164]

evidence against the appellant
was inferential and entirely circumstantial, that his defence was consistent
with truth and that of aiding and abetting pointed to a rational hypothesis of
innocence. The learned trial Judge correctly pointed out that the evidence of
aiding and abetting was not inferential and entirely circumstantial. Apart from
any other item of evidence, the remarks in the restaurant constituted direct
evidence against the appellant. Notwithstanding this, the learned trial Judge
did instruct the jury with regard to circumstantial evidence and that if their
verdict depended upon circumstantial evidence, he stated: ""Before you can
find the prisoner 'guilty' on circumstantial evidence, you must be satisfied
not only that the circumstances proved are consistent with his having committed
the act, but you must also be satisfied that the facts are such to be
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the prisoner is the
guilty person."" This language is almost identical with that in Hodge's
Case [7] which
has been repeatedly approved. McLean v. The King [8].

The foregoing objections cannot,
with respect, be supported. The charge of the learned trial Judge read as a
whole set forth the issues and reviewed the facts in relation thereto in a
manner that placed the case for the defence fully and fairly before the jury.

The appeal should be dismissed.

KELLOCK J. (dissenting):—I desire
to refer to two only of the grounds of the dissenting judgment of O'Halloran
J.A. The third, with which I shall first deal, is as follows:

3. The learned Judge did not
instruct the jury upon the legal meaning of aiding and abetting directed to the
evidence presented by the Crown and the defence; for example, he did not instruct
the jury that passive presence is not aiding and abetting.

The jury, having deliberated some
two hours after having been charged by the learned trial judge, returned to the
court room, the foreman stating that they would like the court to explain to them
the meaning of the word ""accessory"".

Thereupon the learned trial judge
told them that an accessory before the fact was a person ""who does or
omits

[Page 165]

an act for the purpose of aiding
anyone to commit the offence; abets, that is assists or encourages any person
in the commission of the offence; or who counsels or procures any person to
commit the offence.""

In elaboration of that he said
that if they were satisfied that Preston and Bryan set out with a common
intention of burning a school (subsequently he told them it was not necessary
that the two had had the common intention from the outset) and that Preston
""assisted in any way either by active part or by omission"" he
would be an accessory and as guilty as the man who actually lit the match. The learned
judge then said that he did not recall that there was anything in the way of
omission which had been suggested but that the Crown had directed attention to Preston's
""active acts"". Very shortly after so stating, however, he said:

Then the Crown directs your
attention to the fact that he didn't do anything about it despite the
statements of this man (Bryan) out across the bridge beside a school, and that
he didn't protest or do anything at the time of the actual setting of the fire.
They say, ""Look at his conduct. Is that the conduct of an innocent
man?""

In his original charge he had
referred to this matter as follows:

I perhaps missed one thing
in presenting the Crown's case. The Crown laid stress on the point—that point
was well enough taken by Mr. McQuarrie—The Crown says ""Well, why did this
man not get out of the car and leave him, particularly when they came back to Westminster
from across the Fraser River bridge?"" Why in the world didn't he say
""Bryan, I don't like the way you are behaving"". Or, why
didn't he telephone the police? The Crown makes that point. You will have it in
mind.

While it was perfectly in order
for the learned trial judge to direct the jury's attention to the appellant's
conduct as a whole for the purpose of determining what weight they should give
to his evidence, I think that when it came to an explanation of the meaning of
abetting in relation to the evidence the jury may well have been misled into an
understanding that they might find in the things the appellant did not do, and
which were enumerated to them, evidence which in itself amounted to
abetting. In this I think there was error.

To constitute a person a party to
a criminal offence within the meaning of section 69 (1)  (c) of the
Criminal Code , it is necessary that there be ""participation"" in the
crime and although a person is present while a crime is 

[Page 166]

being committed, yet if he takes
no part in it and does not act in concert with those who commit it, he is not a
party merely because ""he does not endeavour to prevent the felony or
apprehend the felon""; per Cave J. in the Queen v. Coney [9].
That learned judge quoted from ""Foster's Crown Law"", where the author
states that ""if A happeneth to be present at a murder, for instance, and
taketh no part in it, nor endeavoureth to prevent it, nor apprehendeth the
murderer, nor levyeth hue and cry after him, this strange behaviour of his,
though highly criminal, will not of itself render him either principal or
accessory"". I take it that the word ""criminal"" is here used in
the sense of ""morally reprehensible"".

Hawkins J. in the same case (1)
said at 557:

It is no criminal offence to
stand by, a mere passive spectator of a crime, even of a murder. Non-interference
to prevent a crime is not itself a crime.

The omission of the appellant to
do any of the things to which the learned trial judge referred on his charge,
were not, in themselves, evidence of abetting. In my opinion the jury may well
have understood the contrary from what was said and have been influenced by it.
I do not find it possible in the circumstances of this case to apply the
provisions of section 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code .

The first ground of dissent is:

1. The learned Judge's
charge led naturally to confuse in the minds of the jury, the evidence relating
to the appellant setting the fire with the evidence relating to his aiding and
abetting, in that the learned Judge treated the case against the appellant as
if it were one of common enterprise and common intention from the outset, and
instructed the jury it did not matter whether Bryan or the appellant started
the fire.

With respect to this what is said
by A. T. Lawrence J. in giving the judgment of the Court in Rex v. Kupferberg
[10],
is relevant. That learned judge said:

To prove conspiracy against
the appellant, it is necessary that an agreement, express or implied, should be
proved to the satisfaction of the jury, but it is quite unnecessary to prove
such agreement where the charge is one of aiding and abetting. In the latter
case, it is only necessary to show that the appellant appreciated what was
going on and did something to further it.

I do not repeat all that was said
by the learned trial judge in the case at bar with respect to ""common
inten-

[Page 167]

tion"". I think that the
distinction above described was not very clearly explained to the jury with
relation to the facts as they might find them. Further, I think that subsection
2 of section 69 of the Code was irrelevant and the repeated references to it
could only have tended to confuse. I would not however, having regard to the
charge as a whole, have thought a new trial necessary on this ground alone.

I would therefore allow the
appeal and direct a new trial.

LOCKE J. (dissenting):—The
appellant was charged that ""he did on the 31st day of January, 1948, with
Nick Bryan, unlawfully and wilfully without legal justification or excuse and
without colour of right, set fire to a certain building, to wit, the Queen Elizabeth School
belonging to the Corporation of the City of New Westminster."" The
evidence enabled the prosecution to contend that (a) it was Preston who
had actually fired the building, or (b) in advance of the commission of
the offence he had conspired or agreed with Bryan to fire the school and that
it was the latter who had actually set the blaze, or (c) he had, within
the meaning of sec. 69  (c) of the Criminal Code , abetted Bryan in
committing the offence or conceivably as a branch of this latter aspect of the
case that he had done some act for the purpose of aiding Bryan to commit the
offence, or counselled or procured him to do so within subss. (b) and (d)
of sec. 69 .

It is sufficient to say without
reviewing the evidence that there was some evidence upon which the jury might
have found under (a) that the appellant had actually fired the building.
There was also evidence upon which they might have found that prior to the time
when the offence was actually committed he had conspired or agreed with Bryan
to commit the indictable offence of arson (an offence in itself under sec. 573
of the Code), and that Bryan had fired the building in pursuance of such
conspiracy or agreement. As to (c) restricting it to subsec. (c)
of sec. 69 , the fact that the appellant had proceeded to the place where the
offence was committed with Bryan and remained in the latter's automobile while
he set fire to the school, if unexplained, was some evidence from which the
jury might have drawn the inference that the 

[Page 168]

appellant was abetting Bryan in
committing the offence (The Queen v. Coney [11]).
As Cave, J. there expresses it, ""where presence may be entirely
accidental, it is not even evidence of aiding and abetting. Where presence is
prima facie not accidental it is evidence, but no more than evidence, for the
jury.""

From the fact that the learned
trial judge in his charge to the jury pointed out and commented upon the
evidence which might justify the jury in finding the accused guilty under
either headings (a) or (b) above and also defined the term
""abet"", it is apparent that all three aspects of the matter were submitted
to the jury and, in my opinion, the real matter to be determined in deciding
the question raised by the first and third grounds of dissent expressed in the
formal judgment of the Court of Appeal is as to the sufficiency of the charge
in instructing the jury as to the law applicable to the charge of abetting and
its application to the evidence. I have come to the conclusion that the dissent
of Mr. Justice O'Halloran upon this ground is well founded. The learned trial
judge in explaining the meaning of the word ""abets"" said that it
meant ""encourages, pushes them on, that is about as good a way I think as
I can put it—abets any person in the commission of the offence or counsels or
procures any person to commit the offence. You must keep that section in mind
here."" After summarizing the evidence for the prosecution he then said:—

Now that is the Crown's
case. The Crown asks you to take all these circumstances and the final fact
that one or the other of them burnt the school or set it on fire, and the Crown
says to you, ""Don't worry who started the fire, but come to the conclusion
that they were engaged in a common enterprise and that regardless of who set
the match or lit the match, the other is guilty."" The particular one
before us today is Preston and the Crown says upon that basis, ""We ask you
to bring in a verdict of guilty against him.""

As a summary this was not
complete since it did not state fully the three contentions of the Crown as
mentioned above and it is clear that the jury recognized this as after retiring
and being out for some two hours they returned and the foreman said that they
would like the court to explain to them the meaning of the word
""accessory"", which clearly related to the charge of abetting Bryan in
committing the offence or of aiding, counselling or procuring him

[Page 169]

to do so. In reviewing the
evidence for the defence the learned trial judge said that the evidence of the
appellant was to the effect that he had no idea of burning a school or being a
party to burning a school and that while he had been with Bryan in his car he
did not grasp the seriousness of the situation, saying in part:—

That is the defence. I
cannot elaborate on it anymore. It is very fresh in your memory. His defence is
this: ""While I was with this man I admit, throughout the hours preceding,
I did not have anything whatever to do with the buying of the gasoline in
preparation for the making of the fire, or the oil. I didn't know that he
seriously intended to burn a school. I didn't have any hand in it and I didn't
leave the car when the fire was set."" Now that is the defence. He says:
""I had no common intent with this man to burn this school"". Now there
is the summary of it. ""I had no common intent with Bryan to burn
this school. I did not take any active part in setting a fire."" That is
the defence.

Immediately following the above
quoted statement he said that the Crown laid stress upon a point which he had
theretofore failed to mention: that the Crown said: ""Well, why did not
this man get out of the car and leave him and particularly when they came back
from Westminster from across the Fraser River bridge? Why in the world didn't
he say: 'Bryan, I don't like the way you're behaving.' Or why
didn't he telephone the police? The Crown makes that point. You will have it in
mind."" When the jury returned for further instructions, after defining an
accessory before the fact and saying: ""abets, that is, assists or
encourages any person in the commission of the offence,"" and again
summarizing the evidence for the defence he said:—

Then the Crown directs your
attention to the fact that he didn't do anything about it despite the
statements of this man out across the bridge beside a school, and that he
didn't protest or do anything at the time of the actual setting of the fire.
They say, ""Look at his conduct. Is that the conduct of an innocent
man?""

The learned trial judge had thus
pointedly directed the attention of the jury to the failure of the appellant to
quit Bryan's company after the remarks made by the latter when they were out at
the property upon the Pacific Highway, his failure to telephone the police and
his failure to protest or do anything at the time of the actual setting of the
fire. These circumstances were perhaps evidence from which the jury might infer
that Preston had conspired or agreed with Bryan to fire the building, but I think it

[Page 170]

much more likely that the jury
understood from the charge that it was suggested that these facts afforded
evidence upon which they might act in finding the appellant guilty of abetting
the commission of the offence. I think this was peculiarly a case where after
explaining the nature of the defendant's evidence the trial judge should have
explained to the jury the application of the law as to aiding or abetting to
the facts as they might find them. It was not sufficient, in my opinion, to
define the legal meaning of the term ""abet"", to state the nature of
the evidence for the defence and to leave it to the jury to decide whether,
assuming the evidence of the appellant was true, he was guilty of the offence.
In the absence of a clear direction, the jury was left to decide for themselves
whether these various acts or omissions amounted in law to abetting. As to the
necessity of carefully explaining to the jury the application of the law as to
abetting to the facts as the jury might find them, I agree with what was said
by Robertson, C.J.O. in Rex v. Dick [12].

In Stephen's Digest of the
Criminal Law, 8th Ed. p. 17, the learned author, summarizing the authorities,
says that mere presence on the occasion when a crime is committed does not make
a person a principal in the second degree (that is, as abetting the commission
of the offence) even if he neither makes any effort to prevent the offence or
to cause the offender to be apprehended, though his presence may be evidence
for the consideration of the jury of an active participation in the offence,
and that when the existence of a particular intent forms part of the definition
of an offence, a person charged with aiding or abetting its commission must be
shown to have known of the existence of the intent on the part of the person so
aided. The appellant's position was, assuming that his story was the truth,
that he did not know that Bryan contemplated committing any offence. As expressed by
Cave, J. The Queen v. Coney, supra, at 539:

Now it is a general rule in
the case of principals in the second degree that there must be participation in
the act, and that, although a man is present whilst a felony is being
committed, if he takes no part in it, and does not act in concert with those
who commit it, he will not be a principal in the second degree merely because
he does not endeavour to prevent the felony, or apprehend the felon.

[Page 171]

In the same case Hawkins, J. said
(p. 557):

In my opinion, to constitute
an aider and abettor some active steps must be taken by word, or action, with
the intent to instigate the principal or principals. Encouragement does not of
necessity amount to aiding and abetting, it may be intentional or
unintentional, a man may unwittingly encourage another in fact by his presence,
by misinterpreted words, or gestures, or by his silence, or non-interference,
or he may encourage intentionally by expressions, gestures, or actions intended
to signify approval. In the latter case he aids and abets, in the former he
does not. It is no criminal offence to stand by, a more passive spectator of a
crime, even of a murder. Non-interference to prevent a crime is not itself a
crime. But the fact that a person was voluntarily and purposely present
witnessing the commission of a crime, and offered no opposition to it, though
he might reasonably be expected to prevent and had the power so to do, or at
least to express his dissent, might under some circumstances afford cogent
evidence upon which a jury would be justified in finding that he wilfully
encouraged and so aided and abetted. But it would be purely a question for the
jury whether he did so or not.

The onlookers at the prize-fight
whose position was considered in Coney's case were present and did not protest
against the prize-fight being held and stayed at the scene and did not inform
the police but they were not guilty of any offence, and, in my view, the
learned trial judge should have instructed the jury that these matters in
themselves did not amount to abetting the commission of the offence in the
present case. In 9 Hals. p. 30, the effect of the authorities is summarized as
follows:—

All who are present aiding
and abetting, when a crime is committed, but who take no part in the actual
perpetration of it, are principals in the second degree.

To constitute a principal in
the second degree mere presence at the crime is not enough; there must be a
common purpose, an intent to aid or encourage the persons who commit the crime
and either an actual aiding or encouraging or a readiness to aid and encourage
them, if required.

The evidence of the appellant was
to the effect that he had left Vancouver that evening in company with Bryan, in
the latter's automobile, to examine some property in the vicinity of New
Westminster, and while the latter had made various wild remarks about burning
schools and expressed his sympathy with the actions of a fanatical sect of the
Doukhobors which engaged in such activities, that he (Preston) did not realize
at the time they stopped in front of the Queen Elizabeth School, or at any time
prior to the actual firing of the building by Bryan, that the latter intended
to set fire to that or any other building

[Page 172]

and that he had taken no part in
committing the offence or done anything that might be construed as abetting Bryan in its
commission. If the jury accepted this as the truth and if they had been
properly instructed as to the application of the law to these facts, I would
assume they would have acquitted the appellant. Upon the record as it is, I
consider that it is impossible to say whether the jury found the appellant
guilty as having abetted the commission of the offence or as having fired the
building himself or as having been a party to an agreement with Bryan to commit
the offence, the latter being the one who actually set the blaze. As was said
by Lord Reading in Isaac Schama and Jacob Abramovitch (1):

We must not be too critical
in dealing with the summing up of a judge after a lengthy trial and speeches by
counsel. Nevertheless, the Court must be satisfied that when the jury find the
prisoner guilty they have applied the right principle of law to the facts
before them.

The prisoner was entitled as a
matter of right to have the jury instructed as to the application of the law to
the facts as found by them and the failure to do this was a substantial wrong.
I think, therefore, sec. 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code  does not apply.

In my opinion, this conviction
should be set aside and a new trial directed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Evidence of accomplice—Corroboration—Nature
of evidence required for corroboration—Circumstantial evidence—Recent
possession—Remarks of trial Judge in passing sentence—Cr. Code s. 1002,
1014—Charge of retaining stolen goods under Cr. Code s. 399.

The Court of Appeal for Alberta affirmed the conviction of the
appellant who had been found guilty by a judge, presiding without a jury, of
retaining in his possession, knowing them to have been stolen, sixteen tires,
the property of the Government of Canada. These tires were stolen from the
R.C.A.F. in Edmonton by one L.A.C Ward. The accused agreed to sell them for
Ward and they were delivered by Ward to the accused at the Low Level Service Station
in Edmonton in a truck bearing the letters R.C.A.F. on the door. The six tires
sold by the accused were recovered and all the others were recovered either at
his house or at the service station.

Held: This was not a conviction on the uncorroborated
evidence of an accomplice.

Held: The conduct of the accused and the circumstances
under which he received and disposed of the tires established his guilt, and
even if the trial judge's direction lacked that precision which the law
contemplates, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred under
section 1014 Cr. Code.

[Page 221]

Held: The remarks made by the trial judge in the course
of his passing sentence, even if he had them in mind when considering his
verdict, would not, in the circumstances, warrant a setting aside of the
conviction.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of
Alberta, Appellate Division, affirming (Ford and Macdonald JJ. A. dissenting)
the conviction of the appellant on a charge of retaining in his possession,
knowing them to have been stolen, sixteen tires, the property of the Government
of Canada, contrary to section 399  of the Criminal Code .

The material facts of the case and the questions in
issue are stated in the judgment now reported.

A. W. Beament, K.C. for the appellant.

H. J. Wilson, K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Estey J.:—The
accused was convicted before a judge presiding without a jury of retaining in
his possession, knowing them to have been stolen, sixteen tires, the property
of the Government of Canada. The Appellate Division in Alberta affirmed the
conviction, Ford and Macdonald, JJ. A., dissenting.

The first ground of dissent is that the learned trial Judge
misdirected himself by disregarding the rule of practice that it is dangerous
to convict upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice.

It must be conceded that LAC Ward as a witness was in
relation to the accused an accomplice. He deposed that on September 16, 1947,
he and two others stole the tires from the R.C.A.F. in Edmonton, that on the
same day he made an arrangement with the accused to sell the tires for them,
and delivered the tires to him at the Low Level Service Station in Edmonton. Rex
v. Robinson 1; Rex v. Galsky 2;
Rex v. Joseph 3.

The accomplice is a competent witness but his implication in
the crime and the possible motives that may

[Page 222]

influence him in giving his evidence
are such that it is dangerous to found a conviction thereon unless it be
corroborated. It need not be corroborated, however, in every detail. It is
sufficient if there be found corroboration of a material fact in independent
evidence which implicates the accused in the commission of the crime.

In Rex v. Baskerville 4, Lord
Reading, C.J., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in
England reviewed the authorities upon the corroboration of the evidence of an
accomplice and stated in part at p. 667:

We hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent
testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him
with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that
is, which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the
crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner committed it.

This Court in Hubin v. The King 5,
followed Rex v. Baskerville (1) and stated at p. 444:

The corroboration must be by evidence independent of the
complainant and it ""must tend to show that the accused committed the crime
charged.""

In Regina v. David Birkett 6, the
accused was found guilty of receiving sheep knowing that they had been stolen.
One of the two persons involved in the theft deposed as to the theft and of the
delivery of one of the sheep by the other party involved in the theft to the
accused who had taken it into the house where he and his father lived. Evidence
as to the finding of a quantity of mutton in that house, which had formed parts
of two sheep corresponding in size with those stolen, and the finding of the
skins in the same place constituted corroboration. This case was approved in Rex
v. Baskerville (1).

Against the accused the Crown did not rely entirely upon the
evidence of Ward but called as witnesses Taylor, the investigator, and Congdon
who purchased six of the tires from the accused.

Flight Sergeant Taylor, R.C.A.F. investigator, on September
19th located some of these tires at the Low Level Service Station. He then
located the accused and with

[Page 223]

him went to the latter's house where three of the tires were
recovered. Then they went to the Low Level Service Station where six more tires
were recovered. Finally they went to Congdon's Transfer where six more were
recovered. The manner in which these tires were recovered leaves no doubt but
that they were the tires that two days before the accused had received from
Ward.

Moreover, before or on the morning of the 18th some of these
tires were removed from the Low Level Service Station to the home of the
accused. On that morning, Congdon deposed, the accused offered for sale some
tires which he inspected at the home of the accused. That afternoon the accused
took six of the tires (four new 900 x 20 and two used of the same size) to
Congdon's Transfer where a sale was concluded of these tires for $300,
approximately one-half of their market value.

The foregoing evidence of Taylor and Congdon corroborates
that of Ward, both as to the place of delivery of the tires, and the fact that
the accused had received and retained them for the purpose of effecting a sale.
This is not, therefore, a case in which a conviction has been made upon the
uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. Moreover, neither this corroborative
nor any other part of the evidence was contradicted.

The learned Judges who dissented were also of the opinion
that the learned trial Judge disregarded the rule of law as to the effect of
circumstantial evidence. This rule is set forth in the oft quoted passage in Hodge's
Case 7, where, in addressing the jury,
Alderson, B., stated that they must be satisfied:

… not only that those circumstances were consistent with
(his having committed the act, but they must also be satisfied that the facts
were such as to be inconsistent with any other national conclusion than that
the prisoner was the guilty person.

The accused was first approached with regard to these tires
by LAC Stubbart, who met the accused on the 17th at the Low Level Service
Station and as to that he stated:

When I got there I met Mr. Lopatinsky and asked him if he
was still interested in tires; he said he would like to see them.

Stubbart denied any knowledge of the theft but why he was
associating himself in the matter was left entirely a

[Page 224]

matter of conjecture. Stubbart then waited at the Low-Level
Service Station until Ward, driving a truck, arrived with the fifteen tires.
This truck had the letters ""R.C.A.F."" on the doors. Stubbart
introduced Ward to the accused and a conversation followed between them which
Stubbart did not hear. Ward deposed that he asked the accused ""if he could
sell the tires for me or buy them himself"", to which the accused replied
""he couldn't buy them himself, he didn't have the money; he said he would
try and sell them for me"". While the accused looked or glanced at the
tires as they remained in Ward's truck, he did not examine them, but as a result
of the conversation these tires were removed by Ward, Stubbart and another
airman, from the truck driven by Ward, and placed in part into another truck at
the service station and in part into the service station. These fifteen tires
were of different sizes, 1100 x 20, 1000 x 20 and 900 x 20, some were retreads
and some were new. Ward said he would like to get $600, and that appears to be
all that was said about the price. No questions were asked with regard to where
these tires came from. In cross-examination Ward did depose that the accused
had inquired about a bill of sale but accepted a statement that they would try
to give him one later. On that date the accused advanced to Ward $100 and the
next day he gave Stubbart $50, which Stubbart handed to Ward.

It is not suggested that any of the parties were engaged in
the business of selling tires nor was the transaction itself conducted as one
in the normal course of business. From the moment Stubbart met the accused and
asked ""if he was still interested in tires"", the matter proceeded
with a minimum of conversation and an absence of discussion as to Ward's
acquisition of the tires', the use and condition of the tires and the value of
them or other items that normally enter into such a transaction.

Under these circumstances, the disposition of the tires at
approximately one-half of their market value is significant. It was this fact,
or it together with the other circumstances that caused Congdon to take the
serial numbers of these tires and before concluding the purchase to communicate
with the police and ascertain if these tires were listed as stolen.

[Page 225]

Throughout the evidence of both Taylor and Congdon there is
no suggestion that any explanation was offered on the part of the accused as to
the circumstances under which he was in possession of these tires which had
been stolen but two or three days prior thereto.

The evidence of guilty knowledge in this as in so many cases
is not directly deposed to. The unexplained fact of recent possession is evidence
thereof.

Rex v. Schama 8.

Wills on Circumstantial Evidence, 7th Ed., 93.

Taylor on Evidence, 12th Ed. sec. 140.

In this case, however, the Crown had not relied upon the
mere fact of recent possession but has adduced evidence of conduct upon the
part of the accused, both with respect to his reception and disposition of the
tires and as to the sale of a portion thereof. These facts were all adduced in
evidence and no explanation tendered in regard thereto. As disclosed in this
record they admit of no doubt as to the guilt of the accused.

The learned trial Judge did not record the reasons upon
which he founded his verdict of guilty and it may be that he did not direct
himself upon the foregoing points with that precision which the law
contemplates. However, the facts and circumstances of this case are such that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred within the
meaning of section 1014  of the Criminal Code .

The other ground of dissent was based upon the learned trial
Judge's reference to the thieves as ""children"" and that the accused
was a ""garageman"". All of the parties were before him and while there
is no evidence as to their respective ages, it was open to him to form his
opinion. The evidence indicates that the accused was driving a truck. But what
interest or association if any he had with the Low Level Service Station is
left a matter of conjecture. It was there he received delivery of the tires on
September 17th, and six of them were recovered from that station on the 19th by
Flight Sergeant Taylor. These remarks were made by the learned trial Judge in
the course

[Page 226]

of his passing sentence upon the accused, but even if he had
them in mind when considering his verdict they would not, in the circumstances,
warrant a setting aside of the conviction.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Conspiring to
defraud—Effect of reception of inadmissible evidence—Appeal from conviction—Onus
on Crown under section 1014 (2)  of Criminal Code —Trial by judge alone—Trial
judge's report under section 1020  of Criminal Code —Substantial wrong and
miscarriage of justice—New trial—Section 444  of Criminal Code —Department of
Munitions and Supply Act, 1940 Statutes of Canada, c. 31 Interpretation Act,
R.S.C. 1927, c. 1.

 [Page 136]

The three appellants were convicted on a charge of conspiring
to defraud the Crown contrary to section 444  of the Criminal Code . The charge
was that they had entered into an unlawful agreement to evade payment of income
tax. At the trial, the Crown introduced statements made by the accused at an
inquiry held under the provisions of the Department of Munitions and Supply
Act, section 19 of which prohibited their disclosure as was unanimously decided
by the Court of Appeal. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that there had
been no miscarriage of justice notwithstanding the improper reception of the
statements. The accused appealed from this judgment.

Held: reversing the judgment appealed from ([1947] 2
W.W.R. 289), Kerwin J. dissenting, that the onus of the Crown to satisfy the
Court that there would without doubt have been a conviction had the illegal
evidence been excluded, has not been discharged.

Per Kerwin J. (dissenting):—The appellants had a fair
trial even though the inadmissible evidence was introduced and the trial judge
could not have failed to convict on the admissible evidence.

APPEAL and Cross-Appeal from
the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1]
, affirming (Sloan C.J. and Robertson J.A. dissenting) the conviction of the
appellants on a charge of conspiring to defraud His Majesty the King in the
right of the Dominion of Canada, contrary to section 444  of the Criminal Code .

Hon. J. W. deB. Farris,
K.C. and John L. Farris for the appellants.

G. L. Fraser, K.C. for the
respondent.

KERWIN J. (dissenting):—While
relying upon the disenting judgment of the Chief Justice of British Columbia[2]
, Mr. Farris preferred to state his proposition in a wider form and to treat
the cases referred to by the Chief Justice as mere examples. His argument was
that if the Wilson evidence, which the Court of Appeal[3]
unanimously held to be inadmissible, is put aside, the accused never really had
a fair trial because his counsel was in effect prevented from cross-examining
upon the balance of the evidence. I am unable to assent to that contention
because in circumstances such as are present here, counsel have to take the
responsibility as to cross-examination upon all the evidence adduced by the
Crown in respect of the charge.

[Page 137]

On the point as to whether there
was a miscarriage of justice, I have come to a conclusion without regard to the
report made by the trial judge although I am unable to say, as the Court found
it possible to decide in Baron v. The King[4]
, that this was not a report within section 1020 of the Criminal Code.
No report had been made by the trial judge and it was only after the case had
been argued for two days, and after the Court of Appeal[5]
had unanimously decided that the Wilson evidence had been improperly admitted,
that the Court[6] , at
the request of counsel for the accused, requested the trial judge to send in
his report. Some of the provisions of section 1020 may be considered
archaic as in practically all cases the evidence is now taken down and transcribed
by a shorthand reporter so that the direction in the section that the trial
judge shall furnish in the Court of Appeal his notes of the trial appears to be
meaningless. I quite agree that the proper time to comply with the section is
before any appeal from the judgment is heard but it seems rather strange that,
after the report had been furnished at the time and in the manner I have
indicated, complaint is now made to its reception and its contents.

In jury cases, the test is the
same where inadmissible evidence has been allowed as in cases of misdirection;
that is, could a reasonable jury have failed to convict on the remainder of the
evidence? I have not overlooked the decision in Allen v. The King[7]
, but each case must depend on its own facts. The present case was tried by a
judge without a jury and in my opinion he could not have failed to convict each
of the appellants on what the Court of Appeal decided was admissible evidence
and the appeal should be dismissed. The Criminal Code  limits the cases in which
an Attorney-General or accused may come to this Court and there was therefore
no authority for the Cross-Appeal by the Crown, which is dismissed.

TASCHEREAU J.:—The appellants
were found guilty by His Honour Judge Lennox on a charge of conspiring together,
by deceit or falsehood or other fraudulent means, to defraud the Crown contrary
to section 444 of the Criminal

[Page 138]

Code. It is suggested that the appellants entered this
alleged unlawful agreement for the express purpose of evading the payment of
income and excess profit taxes.

In 1942, the West Coast
Shipbuilders Limited was engaged in building at Vancouver for the Dominion
Government, fifty-five 10,000 ton ships. The J. L. Northey & Sons Limited,
of which the principal officers and shareholders were the three appellants,
contracted for the construction of the ships' furniture, and during the same
year, this contract was assigned by J. L. Northey & Sons Company Limited,
to a newly formed company known as the Millwork Industries Limited, and of
which the appellants were also the only directors and shareholders.

It was the contention of the
Crown at the trial, that the appellants attempted to defraud the Dominion
Government by means of falsification of invoices. Each of the appellants had
other companies in which they were interested and which they owned and
controlled. For instance, appellant J. L. Northey, father of the two other
appellants, was particularly interested in J. L. Northey Company Limited and in
Millout Homes & Lumber Company. An other appellant, Paul Northey, was
president of Paul Northey Homes Limited, and the third appellant, Archibald
Northey, was the owner of Northey Construction Company Limited. These three
companies were indebted to other companies for merchandise sold.

It is the Crown's submission that
the appellants paid some of their personal accounts and also some of the
accounts of the companies they controlled out of the funds of the Millwork
Industries Limited. Invoices would be falsified so that in the books of the Millwork
Industries Limited, the amounts of the cheques were charged to the costs of the
operation of that company. As a result of this procedure, the debts of the
other companies would be reduced and the profits of Millwork Industries Limited
would be diminished, with the result that the Crown would lose income and
excess profit taxes.

Before the charges were laid
against the appellants, a Dominion investigator, Mr. James C. Wilson, conducted
an inquiry under the provisions of the Department of Munitions and Supply
Act —1940, Statutes of Canada, 

[Page 139]

chap. 31. He interviewed the three appellants, and the
statements made by them were introduced at the trial before His Honour Judge
Lennox. The Court of Appeal[8] , the
Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Robertson dissenting, dismissed the appeal, but
during the hearing, the Court unanimously decided that the ""Wilson
evidence"" had been improperly received by the trial judge, because of the
prohibition against its disclosure found in section 19 of the Department
of Munitions and Supply Act. Notwithstanding the fact that this evidence
was ruled out, the majority of the Court held in effect that there had been no
miscarriage of justice, affirmed the conviction and denied to the accused a new
trial.

The dissent of the Chief Justice,
in which Mr. Justice Robertson concurred, is based on the ground that the
improper reception of the ""Wilson evidence"" was so prejudicial, that
the accused did not have a fair trial. They held that with the evidence that
was left, it was not for the Court of Appeal to determine the guilt or
innocence of the appellants, and that it would be to assume the role which is
reserved to the jury or to the trial judge, if they attempted to weigh that
evidence and to come to any conclusion.

During the argument before this
Court, Mr. G. L. Fraser, K.C., counsel for His Majesty the King, who has filed
a Cross-Appeal, argued that the Court of Appeal[9] , was
wrong in excluding the evidence given by Mr. Wilson. It seems quite unnecessary
to deal with the right which the Crown may have to Cross-Appeal, or with its
right to ask without Cross-Appeal that the judgment of the learned trial judge
be affirmed, even for reasons other than those given by the Court of Appeal, as
I come to the conclusion that on this point, the decision of the Court below
was sound.

Section 19 of the Department
of Munitions and Supply Act, as amended by section 12 of Chap. 31, Statutes of
Canada, 1940, says:—

19. (1) No information with
respect to an individual business which has been obtained under or by virtue of
this Act shall be disclosed without the consent of the person carrying on that
business:—

[Page 140]

Provided that nothing in
this subsection shall apply to the disclosure of any information—

(a) to a government
department, or any person authorized by a government department, requiring such
information for the purpose of the discharge of the functions of that
department; or

(b) for the purposes of any
prosecution for an offence under this Act, or, with the consent of the
Minister, for the purposes of any civil suit or other proceeding at law.

(2) If any person discloses
any information in contravention of this section, he shall be guilty of an
offence under this Act.

As the present prosecution is
under section 444 of the Cr. Code and not under the Department
of Munitions and Supply Act, the proviso contained in section 1 (b)
does not apply.

Moreover, the contention of the
Crown is that the power of the Minister of Munitions and Supply, to direct that
an inquiry be held, was not given until 1943, when the Department of
Munitions and Supply Act was amended to so provide. Therefore the
prohibition against disclosure of information would apply only to information
obtained under the provision of the Act as it was enacted in 1940, and not to
information obtained at an inquiry held by vintue of the 1943 amendment.

I believe that this proposition
is unsound in view of the provisions of section 22 of the Interpretation Act
of 1927, R.S.C. Chap. 1. This section is as follows:—

22. An amending Act shall,
so far as is consistent with the tenor thereof, be construed as one with the
Act which it amends.

It seems clear, that the
prohibition contained in section 19 against disclosure of information
obtained by virtue of the Act, applies to all information obtained by
virtue of any section of the Act, whenever passed.

The grounds of appeal are stated
as follows in appellants' factum:—

1. It is submitted that the
majority of the Court of Appeal were wrong in refusing a new trial based on the
ground that no miscarriage of justice was caused by the wrongful admission of
the Wilson evidence because in their Lordships' opinion the remaining
admissible evidence conclusively established the guilt of the appellants. It is
submitted that the decision has denied to the accused a fair trial because a
conviction following improperly admitted evidence of a confession of guilt is
no trial at all, and a conviction without a trial necessarily constitutes a
miscarriage of justice.

[Page 141]

2. In the alternative, it is
submitted that the majority of the Court of Appeal were wrong in finding that
the trial judge was bound to convict on the evidence which remained after
excluding the Wilson evidence and the hearsay evidence wrongfully admitted.

When evidence has been improperly
admitted, as in the present case, the Court of Appeal, in view of section
1014  of the Criminal Code , may dismiss the appeal if,
notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the appeal might be decided in
favour of the appellant, it is also of opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. This section of the Criminal Code 
has been examined by the courts in England where the law is similar, and by
many courts in this country.

In Allen v. Rex[10]
, Chief Justice Sir Charles Fitzpatrick said at page 336:—

The underlying principle of
both (the English and Canadian Section) is that, while the Court has a
discretion to exercise in cases where improper evidence has been admitted, that
discretion must be exercised in such a way as to do the prisoner no substantial
wrong and to occasion no miscarriage of justice; and what greater wrong can be
done a prisoner than to deprive him of the benefit of a trial by a jury of his
peers on a question of fact so directly relevant to the issue as the one in
question here—the existence of previous threats—and to substitute therefor the
decision of judges who have not heard the evidence and who have never seen the
prisoner? It may well be that our opinion sitting here in an atmosphere very
different from that in which the case was tried the evidence was quite
sufficient, taken in its entirety, to support the verdict, but can we say that
the admittedly improper questions put by the Crown prosecutor and the answers
which the prisoner apparently very reluctantly gave did not influence the jury
in the conclusion they reached? We must not overlook the fact that it is the
free unbiased verdict of the jury that the accused was entitled to have.

And further[11]
at page 339 he also expressed the following views:—

It was argued that the
Section of our Code, upon which the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal
relied, specially provides that the appeal shall be dismissed even where
illegal evidence has been admitted, if there is otherwise sufficient legal
evidence of guilt. I cannot agree that the effect of the section is to do more
than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal a discretion which they
may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal evidence or other
irregularities are so trivial that it may be safely assumed that the jury
was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt as to this the prisoner
must get the benefit of that doubt propter favorem vitae. To say that we
are in this case charged with the duty of deciding the extent to which the improperly
admitted evidence may have influenced some of the jurors would be to hold, as I
have already said, that Parliament authorized us to deprive the accused

[Page 142]

in a capital case of the
benefit of a trial by jury. The law on this express point was laid down by the
Privy Council in Makin v. A.G. for New South Wales[12]
(citing therefrom).

And in Makin v. Attorney-General
for New South Wales[13]
, the Lord Chancellor said at page 69:—

The point of law involved
is, whether where the judge who tries a case reserves for the opinion of the
Court the question whether evidence was improperly admitted and the Court comes
to the conclusion that it was not legally admissible, the Court can
nevertheless affirm the judgment if it is of opinion that there was sufficient
evidence to support the conviction, independently of the evidence improperly
admitted and that the accused was guilty of the offence with which he was
charged.

It is obvious that the
construction contended for transfers from the jury to the Court the determination
of the question whether the evidence established the guilt of the accused. The
result is that in a case where the accused has the right to have his guilt or
innocence tried by a jury, the judgment passed upon him is made to depend not
on the finding of the jury, but on the decision of the Court. The judges are in
truth substituted for the jury, the verdict becomes theirs and theirs alone,
and is arrived at upon a perusal of the evidence without any opportunity of
seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and weighing the evidence with the
assistance which this affords.

And again at page 70, he said:—

Their Lordships do not think
it can properly be said that there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice, where on a point material to the guilt or innocence of the accused
the jury have, notwithstanding objection, been invited by the judge to consider
in arriving at a verdict matters which ought not to have been submitted to
them.

In their Lordships' opinion
substantial wrong would be done to the accused if he were deprived of the
verdict of the Jury on the facts proved by legal evidence, and there were
substituted for it the verdict of the court founded merely upon a perusal of
the evidence. It need scarcely be said that there is ample scope for the
operation of the proviso without applying it in the manner contended for.

Their Lordships desire to
guard themselves against being supposed to determine that the proviso may not
be relied on in cases where it is impossible to suppose that the evidence
improperly admitted can have had any influence on the verdict of the jury, as
for example where some merely formal matter not bearing directly on the guilt
or innocence of the accused has been proved by other than legal evidence.

The same principles were
reaffirmed by this Court in Gouin v. The King[14]
, in Brooks v. The King[15] ,
and recently in Schmidt v. Rex[16]
.

It is also a well established
principle that the burden is upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the
verdict would necessarily have been the same, if the charge had been
correct, or if no evidence had been improperly admitted. (Schmidt v.
Rex[17]
).

[Page 143]

The principles enunciated in the
above cases must be applied and govern the present case. Illegal evidence of a
very damaging character was admitted at the trial, which was highly prejudicial
to the accused. It is quite problematical to value all the effects of the
admission of this illegal evidence, but it may safely be said, I think, that it
may have seriously affected the cross-examination of the Crown witnesses, held
out other evidence, and possibly changed the whole strategy of the defence. It
may also, and this is quite natural and understandable, have seriously
influenced the learned trial judge, in the reaching of his conclusions, as it
would have undoubtedly impressed unfavourably upon the minds of twelve jurors.

The learned trial judge made his
report to the Court of Appeal[18] during
the argument, only after the ""Wilson Evidence"" had been ruled
inadmissible. In view of the decision of this Court in Baron v. The
King[19]
, this report cannot be considered as having been given within the meaning of section
1020 of the Cr. Code, and should therefore be ignored.

It is possible for this Court to
dismiss the present appeal, only if the irregularities are so trivial that
it may be safely assumed that the trial judge was not influenced by them, or as
it was said in the Schmidt case[20]
, ""that the verdict would necessarily have been the same"", if
the illegal evidence had not been admitted.

With deference, I cannot come to
that conclusion without entering the field of hypothesis and conjecture. As
there will be a new trial, I shall not attempt to discuss the evidence given,
but I may say that it is not sufficiently convincing to allow me to think, that
had this evidence not been introduced, the result would have been the same.
This Court is not the proper forum where the guilt or the innocence of the
appellants is to be determined.

I entirely agree with the
following statement of Chief Justice Sloan in his dissenting judgment: 

The
function of this Court is not to retry the accused and to decide upon his guilt
or innocence. This Court is a Court of Review, and the issue before us, in this
case, is not the guilt or innocence of the accused, but whether or not the
accused has had a fair trial on proper evidence.

[Page 144]

If we did come to one conclusion
or another, after weighing the evidence that remains, we would substitute
ourselves to the trial court, and deprive the accused of his indisputable right
to be tried by a jury or a trial judge who have the advantage of seeing and
hearing the witnesses.

I agree that the appeal should be
allowed, the conviction quashed, and a new trial directed. The Cross-Appeal
should be dismissed.

RAND J.:—The accused, father and
two sons, were charged with conspiracy to defraud the Dominion Government in
relation to income tax. They were interested in the furniture and housing
industries. A company wholly controlled by the father had obtained a contract
which ultimately involved the supply of furnishings to fifty-five 10,000-ton
ships constructed in British Columbia. To carry out this work the three
organized a company named ""Millwork Industries Limited"" to which for
a commission the contract was assigned. At this time two other companies,
controlled one by each of the two sons, were being pressed by their creditors.

It was established by a mass of
evidence that in the course of the operations of the Millwork Company and in
several hundred items, the moneys of that company paid out by cheque were
applied to debts of these outside companies as well as to private debts of the
three shareholders; and, in certain cases, they were alleged to have been used
to pay accounts owing by a third brother who was not interested in the Millwork
Company.

As it was a family company, this
use of the company's funds, as such, certainly so far as the Crown was
concerned, would be unobjectionable. But it did not end there. These
disbursements were represented in the company's records either by altered
invoices originally directed to the other companies or to the individuals or by
fictitious invoices and the whole charged against one or more of the expense
accounts of the Millwork Company. It is, therefore, in a conspiratorial
connection in one form or another between the accused and these manipulations
that guilt lies.

[Page 145]

Prior to the prosecution, an
inquiry had been held under section 22 of The Department of Munitions
and Supply Act as enacted in 1943 which gives the Minister the power to cause
such an inquiry to be made ""into and concerning any matter relating to or
incidental to a contract for the manufacture or production of munitions of war
or supplies or for the construction or carrying out of a defence project, and
may appoint a person or persons by whom the inquiry shall be conducted.""
Under section 19 (1) passed in 1940 ""No information with respect to
an individual business which has been obtained under or by virtue of this Act
shall be disclosed without the consent of the person carrying on that
business."" Certain exceptions to that prohibition are not material here.
Before the commissioner, all three of the accused made statements self-incriminatory
which, over objection, were admitted in evidence by the trial judge.

On an appeal from conviction, the
Court of Appeal[21] during
the argument unanimously decided that the admission of this evidence had been
improper. They then proseeded to deal with the appeal under ss. (2)  of
section 1014  of the Criminal Code  and a majority, O'Halloran,
Smith and Bird, JJ. A. with Sloan, C.J. and Robertson, J.A. dissenting, came to
the conclusion that ""no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice""
had actually occurred; and the case comes here on the point of that dissent.

The finding of guilt was preceded
by a short statement of the trial judge in the course of which he made these
remarks:

It is true that the law of
conspiracy is somewhat difficult to prove, and it is also true that in the
proof of conspiracy, one act or two acts taken out of the general practice
would not, of course, prove or allow the court to infer conspiracy on those
isolated acts. But this is also true, that the general practice shown by those
individual examples might, with the congregation of those items, be sufficient
and properly sufficient in law, and in every other way, to come to the
conclusion that the conspiracy is proved. *** I find that I cannot come to any
other conclusion on the evidence before me but that the charge is proved.

The ""evidence before
me"" included the admissions that had been improperly accepted, and the
question is whether in that situation it can be said that no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice can have taken place.

[Page 146]

The Crown relies on the
interpretation laid down in Stirland v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[22] ,
that the proviso ""assumes a situation where a reasonable jury, after being
properly directed, would, on the evidence properly admissible, without doubt
convict"", language that was quoted with approval in Schmidt v.
The King[23]
. It was pointed out by Lord Simon that the trial judge, in his summing up,
advised the jury to disregard entirely the impeached questions, but the words
""after being properly directed"" seem rather to refer to a direction
than to advice.

Assuming that view has been
accepted by this Court and applying it to the facts here, I think it impossible
to say that on the evidence bearing upon the connection of the father and the
son Paul with the tainted invoices and book entries, together with any
inferences that could possibly be drawn from the payment transactions
themselves, the trial judge, rejecting the objectionable evidence, must have
come to the same decision of guilt, or that, conversely, a verdict of acquittal
would have been perverse.

I would, therefore, allow the
appeal and direct a new trial.

ESTEY J.:—The three accused, J.
L. Northey, father, and his two sons, P. M. Northey and A. J. Northey, were the
principal shareholders and officers in Millwork Industries Limited which,
during the period in question, manufactured ship furnishings at Vancouver.

The three accused were charged
that between January 1, 1942, and December 31, 1944, they conspired to defraud
His Majesty The King in the right of the Dominion of Canada, contrary to section
444  of the Criminal Code . The three accused were tried under the
speedy trial provisions of the Criminal Code  and found guilty.

The evidence divides itself into
two parts: (a) that given by the three accused as witnesses at an
inquiry with respect to the business of Millwork Industries Limited before Jas.
C. Wilson under the Department of Munitions & Supply Act, 1939 (2nd
Sess.) S. of C., c. 3, and amendments thereto. This evidence was put in at
the trial by calling Mr. Wilson,

[Page 147]

and it is hereafter referred to
as the ""Wilson evidence"". (b) That of the bookkeeper of
Millwork Industries Limited with respect to the practice in that office,
particularly dealing with certain items showing alterations of actual invoices
and writing up of fictitious invoices, the proceeds of which benefited one or
other of the three, and which were under one heading or another charged up to
cost of supplies and expenses, with the result that the net revenue and
consequent income taxes were greatly reduced. The balance of the evidence was
that of indivduals outside of this company relative to the invoices and credits
given for cheques received and drawn upon the accounts of Millwork Industries
Limited.

The Court of Appeal[24]
unanimously decided that under section 19 of the Department of
Munitions & Supply Act, 1939, as amended by section 12, 1940 S. of C., c.
31, the evidence taken at the inquiry was at the trial improperly received.
The majority of the learned Judges were of the opinion that, notwithstanding
the improper reception of this evidence no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice had actually occurred within the meaning of section 1014 (2)  of
the Criminal Code  and affirmed the conviction. The minority of the
learned Judges were of the opinion that there was a substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice and that a new trial should be had.

1014. (2) The Court may also
dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that on any of the
grounds above mentioned the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appeallant, it is also of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred.

The Wilson evidence was important
and material in that it constituted admissions by each of the accused parties
of complicity in the offence of conspiracy to defraud His Majesty as charged.
The learned trial Judge, in the course of his brief reasons, made no reference
to the Wilson evidence and concluded:

I find that I cannot come to
any other conclusion on the evidence before me but that the charge is proved.

In Allen v. The King[25]
, the accused was charged with murder. Evidence suggesting a motive was
improperly introduced during the cross-examination of the accused. The majority
of the learned Judges in the Appellate Court

[Page 148]

held this evidence inadmissible
but that it was not more than a trivial irregularity and under section 1019 (as
it then read—now section 1014 (2)  of the Criminal Code 
affirmed the conviction. In this Court a new trial was directed. Sir Charles
Fitzpatrick, C.J., (with whom Duff, J., later Chief Justice, agreed), at p. 335
stated:

My difficulty is to say to
what extent the jury, or any one of them, may have been influenced by the
questions put to the prisoner on cross-examination by the Crown prosecutor.

Then at p. 339, referring to
section 1019:

I cannot agree that the
effect of the section is to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on
an appeal a discretion which they may be trusted to exercise only where the
illegal evidence or other irregularities are so trivial that it may safely be assumed
that the jury was not influenced by it. If there is any doubt as to this the
prisoner must get the benefit of that doubt propter favorem vitae. To
say that we are in this case charged with the duty of deciding the extent to
which the improperly admitted evidence may have influenced some of the jurors
would be to hold, as I have already said, that Parliament authorized us to
deprive the accused in a capital case of the benefit of a trial by jury.

At p. 363 Anglin, J. (later Chief
Justice) stated:

""A substantial
wrong"" is ""occasioned thereby on the trial"" when counsel for the
Crown improperly places before the jury, as having been sworn to, statements
which may influence them adversely to the accused upon a material issue.

In Gouin v. The King[26]
, the learned trial Judge misdirected the jury. In this Court, after commenting
upon Allen v. The King[27]
, my lord The Chief Justice (then Rinfret, J.) in writing the judgment of the
Court stated at p. 544:

In the circumstances of this
case we cannot come to any other conclusion but that the jury may have been
influenced by the improper direction and therefore the conviction cannot stand.

In Schmidt v. The King[28]
, the accused was convicted of murder. Two items of misdirection were
considered. With respect to the first the learned trial Judge had failed to
comply with ""advisable practice"" but had not violated any absolute
rule. As to the second, while his illustrations ""were not apt"", it
was pointed out ""that later in his charge the trial Judge stated the law
correctly but he did not apply the law to the evidence as fully as he might
have

[Page 149]

done."" It was under these
circumstances held that the conviction should be affirmed. Mr. Justice Kerwin,
writing the judgment of the Court[29] ,
stated:

In this case a reasonable
jury on a proper direction would have undoubtedly convicted Schmidt and the
appeal is therefore dismissed.

Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions[30]
: In this case certain questions were asked relative to credibility in cross-examination.
Counsel for the appellant did not object to the questions and in his summing up
the Common Serjeant advised the jury to take the appellant as being of good
character. The House of Lords held the evidence inadmissible but that it
occasioned no substantial miscarriage of justice. Viscount Simon, with whom the
other lords concurred, stated at p. 320:

Apart altogether from the
impeached questions (which the Common Serjeant in his summing-up advised the
jury entirely to disregard), there was an overwhelming case proved against the
appellant. When the transcript is examined it is evident that no reasonable
jury, after a proper summing up, could have failed to convict the appellant on
the rest of the evidence to which no objection could be taken. There was,
therefore, no miscarriage of justice, and this is the proper test to determine
whether the proviso to s. 4, sub-s. 1, of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, should
be applied.

Then in Kelly v. The
King[31]
, Duff, J. (later Chief Justice) discussed section 1019 (now as amended 1014
(2)):

In these circumstances there
was obviously no ""miscarriage""; and assuming there was some technical
""wrong"" there can be in my judgment no ""substantial
wrong"" from the admission of inadmissible evidence if it must be affirmed
that relatively to the whole mass of admissible evidence that which is open to
exception is merely negligible and that in the absence of it the verdict could
not have been otherwise. This conclusion is in no way inconsistent with the
acceptance of the criterion suggested in Makin's Case,[32]
. In such a case the impeached evidence cannot in any practical sense be
supposed ""to have had any influence upon the verdict.""

The Wilson evidence improperly
received was neither ""trivial"" nor ""merely negligible"" when
considered ""relatively to the whole mass of admissible evidence"". On
the contrary it was, relative to the whole, important and implicated each of
the accused parties in the offence charged to a degree that it would be
impossible to conclude but that it may have influenced the decision. Indeed,
having regard to its content, it may well have been a determining factor. It is
therefore not a case in which

[Page 150]

it can be concluded ""that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice"" has actually occurred as that
statement has been construed in the Allen[33] and
other cases, supra.

The reasons of the learned trial
Judge in finding the accused guilty indicate that he so concluded upon all the
evidence before him. There is no suggestion that any part thereof was
disregarded, and in so far as his report under section 1020, made some
time later and after an illness, suggests otherwise, the former should be
accepted.

In any event, under the
circumstances of this case it appears to be impossible to conclude that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred, and
therefore a new trial must be had.

The appeal should be allowed and
a new trial directed.

LOCKE J.:—In this matter the
dissent of the Chief Justice of British Columbia and of Mr. Justice Robertson
is expressed in the formal judgment[34] as
being upon the ground that as a matter of law the provisions of section 1014
(2)  of the Criminal Code  ought not to be applied in the
circumstances of this case. The Court of Appeal[35]
had during the hearing unanimously decided that what has been called the Wilson
evidence, which had been taken during an enquiry under the provisions of the Department
of Munitions and Supply Act, had been improperly admitted at the trial, and
the reasons for judgment of the learned Chief Justice refer to the fact that
part of the other evidence received had been inadmissible as hearsay. In
consequence of the admission of this evidence the learned Judges who dissented
were of the opinion that the accused had not had a fair trial and that
accordingly the powers conferred upon the Court by the Code, section 1014
(2), should not be exercised.

I agree with the finding of the
Court of Appeal[36] as to
the Wilson evidence and I am further of the opinion that a considerable amount
of the evidence tendered by the Crown for the purpose of proving that goods
paid for by Millwork Industries Limited had in fact been purchased by and
delivered to one or other of the accused, or to the companies controlled by one
or other of them, was

[Page 151]

inadmissible as hearsay. Eliminating
the evidence so improperly admitted, the matter to be decided is as to whether
upon the remaining evidence the verdict would necessarily have been the same (Schmidt
v. The King (1), Kerwin, J. at 440). Since there is to be a new
trial it is undesirable that there should be any extended comment on the
evidence. The onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that there would
without doubt have been a conviction had this evidence been excluded and, in my
opinion, that onus has not been discharged in this case. I have come to this
conclusion upon consideration of the evidence alone as I think the report of
the learned trial Judge which, owing to his unfortunate illness, was not made
until some months had elapsed from the date of the trial and at a time when the
appeal had been partly heard cannot be considered.

The conviction should be quashed
and there should be a new trial.

Appeal
allowed, conviction quashed and new trial directed. Cross-Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal Law—Accused charged
of murder entitled to have all his defences adequately put to jury by trial
judge—Appellant conspired with two others to hold up and rob bank, when block
away turned back, were intercepted by police and appellant disarmed—Companion
attempting to escape killed policeman—Whether appellant party to offence of
murder within meaning of S. 69 (2)  Criminal Code , or had abandoned common
intention to prosecute unlawful purpose—Whether such common intention was (a)
attempt to rob bank; (b) to resist arrest by violence and assist each other in
doing so; or (c) conspiracy to rob bank—Whether trial judge erred in charging
jury appellant guilty of an attempt to rob bank within meaning of S. 72 (2)  of
Criminal Code .

The appellant together with one M and C, each having provided
himself with a revolver and ammunition, proceeded in a motor car to hold up and
rob a bank. The police having learned of the plot had parked a police car near
the bank. When the trio were a short distance from it they turned the car
about, abandoned it about a mile away, and walked to some railway tracks. They
were there intercepted by two policemen in plain clothes who escorted them back
to a detective also in plain clothes. The latter after asking the appellant his
name and receiving no reply, noticed the appellant's revolver and took it from
him without resistance, objection or protest. At this moment the suspects, who
were standing in line, sprang in different directions, the police giving chase.
M in his flight turned and shot his pursuer. The police returned the fire. As a
result of the shooting, C and the two policemen were killed, M and the

[Page 227]

detective, wounded. The appellant took no part in the shooting
but in his flight joined M and was subsequently arrested while hiding with him.
M and the appellant were charged jointly with the murder of the policeman shot
by M, but were tried separately, and both found guilty. M was executed and the
present appeal is from the conviction of the appellant.

Held: The appellant was entitled to have each of his
defences adequately put to the jury by the trial judge, and since this was not
done with regard to his principal defence, that of abandonment (Kerwin J.
dubitante), there should be a new trial.

Per Kerwin, Estey and Locke JJ.: There was evidence
upon which the jury might properly find that there had been an attempt to
commit an offence within the meaning of S. 72  of the Criminal Code .

Per Kerwin J.: Such offence constituted an attempt to
rob the bank and in leaving the question to the jury, the trial judge did not
prejudice the accused.

Per Taschereau and Kellock JJ.: The question was,
whether on the evidence the trio had sufficient reason for thinking they had
rendered themselves liable to arrest and had determined to resist to the extent
of using violence if necessary. It was open to the jury on the evidence to
conclude that the appellant at the time of the shooting was a party to the
prosecution of an unlawful purpose; it was also open to them to come to a
contrary conclusion, if they were of opinion that even had there been an
earlier unlawful intention, it had, so far as the appellant was concerned, been
abandoned. Before the appellant could be convicted it was essential that these
alternatives should have been put to the jury by the trial judge from the
standpoint of the Defence as well as the Crown, which was not done.

Per Taschereau J.: The conspiracy to rob the bank was
complete and this in itself was a crime, but the subsequent facts revealed by
the evidence did not show the essential ingredients of an attempt to rob the
bank within the meaning of S. 72  of the Criminal Code . An intent, an act
of preparation, and an attempt, must not be confused. A mere intent is not
punishable in criminal law, even if coupled with an act of preparation. Reg.
v. Eagleton, Dears C.C. 515; It cannot be held that the mere fact of
going to a place where the contemplated crime is to be committed, constitutes
an attempt. There must be a closer relation between the victim and the author
of the crime; there must be an act done which displays not only a preparation
for an attempt, but a commencement of execution, a step in the commission of
the actual crime itself.

The trial judge erred in charging the jury that ""they
could be prosecuted for attempting to rob a bank"" and ""the attempt is
complete when they take any steps in connection with it."" This confused
the issue and was prejudicial to the accused. The question of whether the
bandits were guilty of an attempt is foreign to the case. Their common unlawful
purpose to hold up and rob the bank and to assist each other in the prosecution
of that purpose, having been frustrated, was obviously not pursued, and it was
not therefore in the prosecution of such purpose that the murder was committed.

[Page 228]

It was for the jury to say, if in view of the evidence the
appellant had been a party to a conspiracy, if such conspiracy was ever formed;
and it was also within their exclusive province to find, after having been
properly instructed, that he had detached himself from any further association
with the other conspirators.

APPEAL by the accused from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1] (O'Halloran J. dissenting) dismissing his appeal
from his conviction, at a trial before Manson J. and a jury, on a charge of
murder. The appeal was on the grounds of dissent taken by O'Halloran J.A. (who
held that there should be a new trial.)

John Groves Gould
for the appellant.

Alfred Bull K.C. for the
respondent.

KERWIN J.:—Attention should first
be directed to the question as to whether in law what was done with the intent
to rob the bank was, or was not, only preparation for the commission of that
offence and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit it as provided by
subsection 2  of section 72  of the Criminal Code . This subsection sets
forth the considerations that are to govern in deciding this question of law
and, with respect, I find very little assistance in considering the circumstances
in other reported cases and I do not find it conducive to the solution of the
problem to attempt to paraphrase the wording of the subsection. It is necessary
to determine this point first, because if the proper conclusion be that there
was no attempt, then Mr. Bull admitted that as the case was put to the jury by
the trial judge on the basis of their being an attempt as well as on the basis
of his wider proposition, it would be impossible to say upon what ground the
jury proceeded and, therefore, for that reason there would have to be a new
trial. In leaving the question to the jury, the trial judge certainly did not
prejudice the accused because the circumstances in this case satisfy me that as
a matter of law what was done falls within the provisions of the subsection so
as to constitute an attempt. I do not detail these circumstances because on
another ground there is to be a new trial.

If upon such new trial there is
evidence of a common intention to rob and to escape with violence, the question

[Page 229]

should specifically be left to
the jury as to whether the accused had desisted from participation in such
common intention. And if it be claimed by the Crown that, irrespective of any
agreement to rob, there was a common intention to flee from the police officers
using force, then a defence that Henderson was not a party to such common
intention should also be put to the jury. These defences were raised by the
accused at his trial and while in discussing the Crown's case the trial judge
did refer to those features, he did not specifically deal with them when he
came to charge the jury as to what the defences were. With some hesitation I am
unable to dissent from the view of those members of this Court who find that
these defences were not adequately put to the jury.

TASCHEREAU J.:—The appellant
Henderson and one Harry Medos were jointly indicted at Vancouver,
B.C. for the murder of Charles Boyes, a police officer. The two accused were
given separate trials, as a result of which Medos was found guilty and
executed, and Henderson who was tried before Manson, J. was also convicted.

It appears from the evidence that
the appellant, Medos, and one Carter conspired together to commit a holdup at
the premises of the Royal Bank of Canada, on the east side of Renfrew Street,
directly opposite the Java Inn at Vancouver. The next day, the three men were
seen in a maroon Mercury car, coming west, on 2nd Avenue. It was observed that
the car turned into the first lane facing south, and backed out to 2nd Avenue
again, and then went east, from whence it had come, and proceeded to the stop
sign at Renfrew Street, and turned north on Renfrew Street in the direction of
the bank, but proceeded only about two car lengths when it swerved to the
right, making a U turn and proceeded at a fast rate of speed east on 2nd
Avenue. The bandits who were on their way to the bank to commit the intended
hold-up, had obviously detected a Police car that was parked in front of the
Java Inn facing south, and found that the occasion was not favourable to carry
out their plot. After having made this U turn, they proceeded in their car for
about a mile and a half, and then abandoned it on Kitchener Street, and walked west towards the Great Northern Railway yards.

[Page 230]

They had admittedly been under
close observation by the police, for when they arrived in the yards, Officers
Boyes and Ledingham drove their car into the yards near the roundhouse, and
accosted them on the railway track where all five crossed the line of tracks
they were on, to another set of tracks. A few seconds later, Detective Sergeant
Hoare arrived, and standing directly opposite the appellant, he said: ""Who
are you fellows anyway?"" and coming nearer the appellant, Hoare said:
""What is your name?"" These two questions remained unanswered, and
looking at the appellant, Hoare saw a gun tucked in the top of his overalls
which he pulled out. He had just taken this gun, when the whole line of men
broke up and the appellant, Medos and Carter sprang in different directions.
Medos who was the first to move was pursued by Officer Boyes, Ledingham going
after Carter. Medos had hardly ran six or seven steps whe he turned and shot
Boyes, and Carter fired at Ledingham. Medos then aimed at Hoare. Unfamiliar
with appellant's revolver, and therefore unable to use it, Hoare moved rapidly
towards a pile of steel plates, trying to reach for his gun, but a bullet
struck him in the left thigh and he fell to the ground. He however tried to get
his gun out of the holster, but was at that same moment struck by another
bullet in the upper part of his right arm, and another shot passed by the left
side of his face. He succeeded in sitting up, and he saw Boyes lying dead on
the ground, and Medos still running. He then raised his gun on his right knee,
and aimed at Medos, but seeing Carter running in a north-westerly direction, he
transferred his aim to Carter and shot him to the ground. He then aimed at
Medos who fell. He fired another shot which killed Carter, and a second shot at
Medos.

As a result of the shooting,
Officer Boyes and Ledingham and Carter were killed. Medos succeeded in escaping
with the appellant, but both were discovered soon after in the basement of a
house on 5th Avenue where they were arrested. In the interval, appellant
had changed his outer clothing, and later Medos' gun was found in the basement
containing one live shell. The gun taken from Henderson by Detective Sergeant
Hoare was fully loaded with live shells, and in appellant's pocket were found
also five other live shells which fitted his gun.

[Page 231]

It is the contention of the Crown
that Henderson, together with Medos and Carter, formed a common intention to
commit a crime by violence, viz. to hold up and rob the Royal Bank of Canada on
Renfrew Street, and to assist each other therein, and that it was a part of the
common intention to overcome all resistence by force of arms, either in the
bank or outside the bank, and to resist lawful apprehension by the police, and
if pursued to shoot if necessary. The Crown further states that such common
intention was at no time abandoned by appellant, that the common design
was frustrated by the police and that it was only the presence of a Police car
immediately across the street from the bank, which caused the bandits to change
their mind, so that instead of continuing their unlawful purpose, they then
directed their attention to resisting lawful apprehension.

The Crown further submits that in
view of section 69 (2)  of the Criminal Code , which reads as follows:—

2. If several persons form a
common intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose, and to assist each other
therein, each of them is a party to every offence committed by any one of them
in the prosecution of such common purpose, the commission of which offence was,
or ought to have been known to be a probable consequence of the prosecution of
such common purpose.

the jury being properly
instructed by the learned trial judge, could find that such a common intention
was formed, and that in the prosecution of such common purpose one or more
of the trio shot and killed Officer Boyes, and that the commission of that
offence was or ought to have been known to be a probable consequence of the prosecution
of such common purpose.

The Crown also submits and it was
put to the jury by Crown counsel, that even if the jury could not find that the
common purpose was as comprehensive as was put to them, there was another view
which could be taken, namely, that when the trio abandoned the motor car on
Kitchener Street, they had already committed a crime, that is to say, they had attempted
to hold up and rob the bank, within the meaning of section 72 of the Code
which is in the following words:—

72. Every one who, having an
intent to commit an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of
accomplishing his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence intended
whether under the circumstances it was possible to commit such offence or not.

[Page 232]

2. The question whether an
act done or omitted with intent to commit an offence is or is not only preparation
for the commission of that offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to
commit it, is a question of law.

It is said that these three men,
when their attempt to hold up the bank was frustrated, formed a common
intention to resist lawful apprehension, which is in itself an unlawful purpose
within the meaning of section 69, and that during the prosecution of
such common purpose, murder was committed by one of their number.

The Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissed Henderson's appeal, Mr. Justice O'Halloran dissenting [2].
The points of dissent are the following:—

(1) The jury were left in a
state of confusion by three inconsistent directions given by the learned judge
apparently in purported compliance with Code S. 72 (2).

(2) The jury were not
instructed under Code S. 72 (2) upon the distinction in law between acts of
preparation as such and acts which could constitute an attempt to hold up the
bank; and further, following what the learned judge ought to have instructed
them in law upon the distinction between ""preparation"" and
""attempt"" (but which he did not do), the jury were not instructed
that it was for them to find whether there was evidence to support an attempt
or merely acts of preparation within the meaning of what the learned judge
ought to have told them constituted ""attempt"" and
""preparation"" respectively. Instead the learned judge decided the
facts as well as the law and instructed the jury an attempt in law had
occurred;

(3) The learned judge
misdirected both himself and the jury upon the legal meaning of attempt;

(4) The learned judge erred
in law in directing the jury that what occurred constituted an attempt in law
to hold up the bank;

(5) The learned judge in
legal effect took away from the jury Henderson's defence of abandonment of the
common intention under S. 69 (2)  to hold up the bank;

(6) Alternatively, the
learned judge erred in law in directing the jury that an attempt to hold up the
bank excluded any defence of abandonment of the common intention to hold up the
bank;

(7) Alternatively, the
learned judge did not leave it to the jury to decide whether any common
intention under S. 69 (2)  existed after the virtual arrest of Henderson et
al by officers Boyes and Ledingham;

(8) Alternatively, the
learned judge did not leave it to the jury to decide whether Henderson,
disarmed before the gun battle in which he took no part, had any common
intention with Medos within the meaning of S. 69 (2) , to take part in the gun
battle in which the murder occurred;

(9) The learned judge,
having put the Crown's case to the jury with great power, did not present Henderson's
case so as to bring out its full force and effect. Read as a whole, the charge
points always to guilt and nothing but guilt;

[Page 233]

(10) The learned judge, in
the course of presenting Henderson's defence, did not bring to the jury's
attention the importance of reasonable doubt when related to (a) common
intention regarding abandonment of the hold-up; (b) absence of any
common intention in Henderson to escape after his virtual arrest by officers
Boyes and Ledingham; and (c) absence of any common intention in
Henderson to take part in the gun battle in which the murder occurred;

(11) The learned judge ought
to have instructed the jury the Crown had not made out a case in law to convict
Henderson of constructive murder.

I would like first to deal with
the contention that the three conspirators while on their way to the bank, were
guilty of an attempt to commit a hold-up and rob the Royal Bank of Canada. With
deference with other views expressed, I cannot agree with this submission. Of
course, the conspiracy to rob the bank was complete and this in itself was a
crime, but I do not believe that the subsequent facts revealed by the evidence
show the essential ingredients of an attempt, within the meaning of section 72 
of the Criminal Code .

An intent, an act of preparation,
and an attempt must not be confused. A mere intent is not punishable in
criminal law, even if coupled with an act of preparation. As it was said in Regina v.
Eagleton [3] at p.
538:—

The mere intention to commit
a misdemeanour is not criminal. Some act is required, and we do not think that
all acts towards committing a misdemeanour are indictable. Acts remotely
leading towards the commission of the offence are not to be considered as
attempts to commit it, but acts immediately connected with it are ***

It was Sir James Stevens in his Digest
of the Criminal Law, who defined an attempt as follows:—

An attempt to commit a crime
is an act done with intent to commit that crime, and forming part of a series
of acts which would constitute its actual commission if it were not
interrupted.

In Principles and Practice of
the Criminal Law 14th ed., Harris at page 11 says:—

Through a mere intention is
not punishable if no steps are taken to carry it into effect, an attempt
to commit either a felony or a misdemeanour is itself a crime, and therefore
the subject of punishment. An attempt may be said to be the doing of any of the
acts which must be done in succession before the intended object can be
accomplished, with the limitation that it must be an act which directly approximates
to the offence, and which, if the offence were committed, would be one of
its actual causes, as distinct from a mere act of preparation.

[Page 234]

Mr. Justice Blackburn once
observed (Roscoe's Criminal Evidence, 15th ed., p. 415):—

There is no doubt a
difference between the preparation antecedent to an offence and the actual
attempt, but if the actual action has commenced which would have ended in the
crime if not interrupted, there is clearly an attempt to commit the crime.

In Roberts Case [4]
Jervis, C.J. says:—

It is difficult and perhaps
impossible *** to define what is, and what is not such an act done, in
furtherance of a criminal intent, as will constitute an offence *** Many acts,
coupled with the intent, would not be sufficient. For instance, if a man
intends to commit a murder, and is seen to walk towards the place of the
contemplated scene, that would not be enough.

In Rex v. Harry
Robinson [5] which I
believe is the leading case, the accused was convicted of the offence of
attempting to obtain money by false pretence. The Court of Criminal Appeal held
that there was no attempt to commit the offence, but only a preparation for the
commission thereof, and quashed the conviction. At page 1152, Lord Reading
said:—

Now in this case the real
difficulty consists in this, that there is no evidence that anything done by
the appellant ever reached the ears of the underwriters. They were the persons
whose minds must be induced to part with the moneys payable under the policy;
they were the persons from whom the money was to be obtained… There must,
however, be some further act on the part of the appellant before it can be said
that the attempt to commit the offence for which he has been indicted is
complete. Applying the test laid down by Baron Parke, (In Regina v. Eagleton)
we come to the conclusion that, in order to constitute an attempt to commit the
offence, the act relied on must be an act directly connected with the
commission of the complete offence.

I entirely agree with what Mr.
Justice O'Halloran says in his dissenting judgment [6]:—

For an act to be an attempt,
it must take place between the attemptor and the attemptee and be proximate to
the crime about to be committed.

Here, the trio were seen in an
automobile in the direction of the bank; but the plot was frustrated by the
presence of the police. There was nothing done by the trio, no overt act immediately
connected with the offence of hold-up and robbing. Although it may be said
that no one could doubt the express purpose of the bandits, I do not believe
that it can be held that the mere fact of going to the place where the
contemplated crime is to be committed, consti-

[Page 235]

tutes an attempt. There must be a
closer relation between the victim and the author of the crime; there must be
an act done which displays not only a preparation for an attempt, but a
commencement of execution, a step in the commission of the actual crime itself.

If any further authority is
needed on this question, vide: Rex v. Rump [7]
at p. 40; Rex v. Labourdette [8]; Rex
v. Woods [9]; Rex
v. Singh [10]; Rex
v. Linneker [11]; Rex
v. Punch [12].

Section 72 , para. 2 of the Criminal
Code  says that the question whether an act done or omitted with intent to
commit an offence, is or is not only preparation for the commission of that
offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit it, is a question of
law.

The jury were told by the learned
trial judge that:

they (trio) could not be prosecuted
for robbing a bank, but they could be prosecuted for attempting to rob a bank
*** the attempt is complete when they take any steps in connection with it.

This statement of law, is, I
think, erroneous. The jury might have thought that it was while trying to
escape, after having committed an act, which they were told was a crime,
that the bandits started the shooting as a result of which the killing ensued.
This obviously confused the issue and was prejudicial to the accused.

I further believe, however, that
the question whether or not the bandits were guilty of an attempt, is entirely
foreign to the case.

There is no possible doubt that
the three accused in view of the evidence produced, were guilty of conspiracy.
The common unlawful purpose was to hold up and rob the Royal Bank of Canada, and
it is also common ground that they intended to assist each other in the
prosecution of that purpose. But, their common purpose having been frustrated,
was obviously not pursued, and it was not therefore in the prosecution
of such common purpose that Officer Boyes was killed.

[Page 236]

To my mind the real issues are
the following:—

Was there at any moment a
concerted plot formed by Medos, Carter and Henderson to resist legal
apprehension with violence? It may well be that this plot if it did exist, was
made originally when it was agreed to rob the bank, or it may be that it was
formed after the bandits were frustrated in the prosecution of the hold-up. If
such a plot did exist, the shooting being the result of a conspiracy, the two
of course might be guilty of murder. The common intention would then be to
resist legal apprehension; that would be the unlawful purpose. Each one of the
trio would be a party to any other offence, committed by any one of them, in
the prosecution of the common purpose, if he had known, or ought to have known,
that it was a probable consequence of the original common purpose. It may
happen, however, and this was for the jury to determine, that Henderson had
ceased to be a party to the conspiracy, and that the shooting which started
after he had been disarmed and under virtual arrest, was the spontaneous act of
Medos. Then, the act of one, would not have been the act of all.

In order that section 69 (2)  may
find its application, the co-conspirators must form not only a common intention
to prosecute an unlawful purpose, but they must agree also ""to assist each
other therein"", and therefore, if a man is disarmed and made incapable of
furnishing the promised assistance, the situation is obviously changed. It is
settled law that a person who has been a party to prosecute a common illegal
purpose, may disassociate himself with his original co-conspirators. As early
as in 1828, in Rex v. Edmeads, Baron Vaughan said at the
Berkshire Assizes (Carrington & Paynes Reports, Vol. 3):—

If it could be shown that
either of them separated himself from the rest, and shewed distinctly that he
would have no hand in what they were going, the objection would have much
weight in it.

In Rex v. Whitehouse
[13]
Mr. Justice Sloan, now Chief Justice of British Columbia, said:—

After a crime has been
committed and before a prior abandonment of the common enterprise may be found
by a jury there must be, in my view, in the absence of exceptional
circumstances, something more than a mere mental change of intention and
physical change of place by those associates who wish to disassociate
themselves from the con-

[Page 237]

sequences attendant upon
their willing assistance up to the moment of the actual commission of that
crime. I would not attempt to define too closely what must be done in criminal
matters involving participation in a common unlawful purpose to break the chain
of causation and responsibility. That must depend upon the circumstances of
each case but it seems to me that one essential element ought to be
established in a case of this kind: where practicable and reasonable there must
be timely communication of the intention to abandon the common purpose from
those who wish to dissociate themselves from the contemplated crime to those
who desire to continue in it. What is ""timely communication"" must be
determined by the facts of each case but where practicable and reasonable it
ought to be such communication, verbal or otherwise, that will serve
unequivocal notice upon the other party to the common unlawful cause that if he
proceeds upon it he does so without the further aid and assistance of those who
withdraw. The unlawful purpose of him who continues alone is then his own and
not one in common with those who are no longer parties to it nor liable to its
full and final consequences.

In Rex v. Croft [14]
it was held that the agreement may be expressly determined and that if it comes
to an end before the crime is committed, the party who has put an end to the
agreement is not guilty. The question whether the agreement has been put to an
end, must be judged in view of all the circumstances revealed by the evidence,
and I have no doubt that it is a question for the jury. It was for them to say,
if in view of the evidence the appellant had been a party to the conspiracy, if
such a conspiracy was ever formed, and it was also within their exclusive
province to find, after having been properly instructed, that he had detached
himself from any further association with the other conspirators.

Unfortunately, all these aspects
of the case were not dealt with, and these omissions were, I believe, highly
prejudicial to the accused. The defence was not presented so as to give it all
its force and effect. It is true that no witnesses were called on behalf of the
appellant, but it is nevertheless the duty of the trial judge, in his charge to
the jury, to explain the exculpatory effect of the evidence, whether it is
given by the witnesses for the Crown or for the accused. Wu. v. The
King [15]. It was
the fundamental right of the appellant, who has been charged of murder, purely
by construction of the law, which in this particular case creates a presumptive
guilt, to have all the features of his defence adequately put to the jury.

[Page 238]

I have to come to the conclusion
that this has not been done, and that the Crown has not established to my
satisfaction that the verdict would have been the same, if the proper direction
had been given.

The appeal should be allowed, the
conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

KELLOCK J.:—The appellant not
having himself taken part in the actual shooting, being unarmed at the time,
the Crown rested its case against him upon section 69 , subsection 2 , of the Code.

With respect to the common
intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose the Crown put forward two theories.
The one, to which Mr. Bull referred as the more comprehensive, was that the
three participants, Medos, Carter and the appellant, had planned the armed
robbery of the Renfrew Street branch bank and resistance of arrest by violence if
necessary. The second theory was that when the would be robbers retreated from
the vicinity of the bank upon sighting the police car parked across the street
they formed a new agreement of the same character to escape or resist arrest.
He contended that such common intention was still operating at the moment of
the shooting, and that there was nothing in the evidence indicating any
abandonment of such common intention on the part of the appellant, but rather
that the evidence indicated the contrary.

The important thing for the Crown
to establish to the satisfaction of the jury beyond reasonable doubt, was that
at the time of the shooting which resulted in the deaths of the two constables,
Boyes and Ledingham, the one having been killed by Medos and the other by
Carter, the appellant was a party to a common intention with the other two to
escape or resist arrest by the use of violence and to assist each other
therein, and that the murder which resulted was or ought to have been known to
the appellant to have been a probable consequence of the prosecution of the
common purpose.

The state of mind of the three
men was therefore the matter to which the attention of the jury had to be
directed 

[Page 239]

on the evidence. Whether or not
the three had actually committed a crime or crimes when they turned away in
their approach to the bank was to my mind not the basic question, but rather
whether the evidence furnished sufficient ground for the jury to conclude that
the three had formed a common unlawful intention of the character mentioned
above, an important element in which would be the view which the three might
reasonably be taken to have entertained as to whether their conduct up to that
time had amounted to the commission of a crime or crimes. No doubt they had
been guilty of a breach of section 573 of the Code. Whether or not it
was likely that they realized that and for that reason had determined not to be
taken and to use violence to prevent being taken, was for the jury. The same
may be said with respect to the offence described in section 464 (b) or
any others which might be suggested on the evidence including the offence of
attempted robbery while armed. The question after all was whether the jury
would conclude on the evidence that the men had sufficient reason for thinking
they had rendered themselves liable to arrest for matters involving
sufficiently unpleasant consequences that they had determined to resist arrest
to the extent of using violence if that should prove necessary.

While it was open to the jury on
the evidence to conclude that the appellant at the time of the shooting was a
party to the prosecution of such an unlawful purpose, it was also, in my
opinion, open to them to come to a contrary conclusion if they were of opinion
that even had there been an earlier unlawful intention it had, so far as the
appellant was concerned, been abandoned. With this Mr. Bull agrees. Before the
appellant could be convicted therefore, it was essential that these
alternatives should have been adequately presented to the jury by the learned
trial judge from the standpoint of the defence as well as from that of the
Crown. With great respect I think that was not done.

The learned judge in his summing
up, after instructing the jury on matters of general application and the
relevant law, laid before them first, the case for the prosecution, then the
substance of what had been said by the various

[Page 240]

witnesses and, finally, the case
for the defence. On reaching the case for the defence, the learned judge
proceeded as follows:

Now, Mr. Foreman, I have
reviewed the evidence pretty fully and it is my duty now to put to you the
defence. I gave you the Crown's case as they put it forward; I have reviewed
the evidence. Now the defence says this ***

The learned judge then told them
that the defence contended that the Crown had not proved, beyond a reasonable
doubt, that the appellant was one of several persons who had formed an
intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein
during the prosecution of which the offence occurred which the appellant knew,
or ought to have known, was a probable consequence; that the Crown had failed
to establish such common intent affirmatively and that, in addition, the
evidence negatived it. He then said that the defence had pointed out that the
appellant did not resist; that the movement in the line of the five men,
consisting of the three confederates and the two police officers, (which
immediately preceded the shooting) had commenced at the end of the line
farthest away from the appellant; that it was said that the latter could have
done nothing else than run in order to get out of the line of fire; and that
immediately prior to his ultimate apprehension he had given himself up. The learned
judge also referred to the fact that the confederates had walked slowly on the
Flats and that there was no shooting when the two policemen came up with them.
I find nothing else material in the charge dealing with the case for the
defence.

In my opinion this was not
adequate to put before the jury what the appellant was entitled to have put,
namely, that should the jury come to the conclusion that any unlawful purpose
which they might find to have existed at an earlier time had been abandoned
prior to the shooting in such a way that the appellant was no longer involved
and that what occurred had arisen without any common unlawful intention to
which the appellant was a party, as to which they should give him the benefit
of any reasonable doubt, they should acquit. I am not saying that it was
necessary that this should have been said in so many 

[Page 241]

words but the jury should have
been clearly instructed on this aspect from the standpoint of the defence.

In Wu v. The King [16]
Lamont, J., in delivering the judgment of this court said at page 616:

There is no doubt that in
the trial court an accused person is ordinarily entitled to rely upon all
alternative defences for which a foundation of fact appears in the record, and,
in my opinion, it makes no difference whether the evidence which forms that
foundation has been given by the witnesses for the Crown or for the accused, or
otherwise. What is essential is, that the record contains evidence which, if
accepted by the jury, would constitute a valid defence to the charge laid.
Where such evidence appears it is the duty of the trial judge to call the
attention of the jury to that evidence and instruct them in reference thereto.

It is a paramount principle of
law that when a defence, however weak it may be, is raised by a person charged,
it should be fairly put before the jury; Rex v. Dinnick [17].

In my opinion, therefore, with
respect, there is no escape from the conclusion that there should be a new
trial.

ESTEY J.:—The accused Henderson's
conviction of the murder of Charles Boyes was affirmed by the Appellate Court
of British Columbia [18]. Mr.
Justice O'Halloran, who dissented, was of the opinion that the learned trial
Judge had erred in not instructing the jury with regard to the defence of
abandonment and in instructing the jury that the accused and his associates
were guilty of an attempt to rob the Royal Bank of Canada.

The evidence disclosed that in
the evening of February 25th the accused, Medos and Carter agreed that on the
following morning they would rob the Royal Bank of Canada on Renfrew Street
in the City of Vancouver. About noon on the 26th of February they proceeded
to do so but as they approached the bank they observed the presence of the
police, turned back and in a short time abandoned their automobile and walked
to the Great Northern railway yards where they were met by the police who had
pursued them. There the shooting occurred which resulted in the death of two
policemen, Boyes and Ledingham, and one of the three parties, Carter.

The evidence established that
Medos fired the shot that killed Boyes, but the Crown contends that Henderson,
within the provisions of section 69 (2)  was a party to, and

[Page 242]

with Medos guilty of the offence
of that murder. It is provided by section 69 (2)  of the Criminal Code 
that:

69. (2) If several persons
form a common intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose, and to assist each
other therein, each of them is a party to every offence committed by any one of
them in the prosecution of such common purpose, the commission of which offence
was, or ought to have been known to be a probable consequence of the
prosecution of such common purpose.

The Crown's contention is that
Henderson, Medos and Carter had formed a common intention to prosecute the
unlawful offence of robbing The Royal Bank of Canada on Renfrew Street,
to assist each other in the course thereof, and after its commission to escape
and to do whatever was necessary under the circumstances to effect that escape.

Counsel for Henderson submits
that, upon the evidence for the Crown (no evidence was given on behalf of the
defence), granting the three parties had a common design to rob the bank, the
evidence warranted a conclusion that prior to the shooting the three, or at
least Henderson, had abandoned any intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose,
that therefore at the time of the shooting each of the three parties was acting
upon his own and not pursuant to any previously agreed upon plan or design. The
common intention had been abandoned and the conduct of the one did not then
involve the others in any responsibility therefor. This defence of abandonment
was the principal contention of the accused and was supported by references to
specific portions of the evidence upon which, because a new trial must be had,
I make no comment.

The learned trial Judge in his
charge to the jury reviewed the submissions of the Crown and the evidence.
Several times in the course thereof he referred to abandonment, but as
incidental to his presentation of the Crown's case and the review of the
evidence. Then, having completed that review, the learned Judge stated:

Now Mr. Foreman, I have
reviewed the evidence pretty fully and it is my duty now to put to you the
defence. I gave the Crown's case as they put it forward; I have reviewed the
evidence.

In what followed the learned
Judge referred to certain portions of the evidence particularly stressed by
counsel for the accused, but omitted any reference to the defence of
abandonment, nor at any point throughout the charge did he discuss abandonment
as a defence in relation to the 

[Page 243]

evidence in support thereof. This
was the principal defence raised on behalf of the accused. It is the right of
every accused to have his defence fairly presented by a trial judge in his
charge to the jury.

A majority of the Court is
of the opinion that, in view of the unfortunate failure of the learned trial
judge to present to the jury the principal ground of defence put forward by the
appellant, his conviction cannot be sustained. Brooks v. The King
[19]

See also MacAskill v. The
King [20].

With deference to the learned
trial judge, and to the learned judges who have expressed a contrary opinion,
in view of the omission to so present the defence of abandonment a new trial
must be had.

Medos had fired the fatal shot. Henderson
would only be a party thereto if the evidence established the presence of a
common intention within the meaning of section 69 (2)  between Henderson and
Medos up to and at the moment of the shooting. Among the alternative bases for
this common intention the Crown contended that the three parties had gone so
far that they had in law committed an attempt to rob the bank, had a common
intention to escape and to do whatever was necessary in order to effect that
escape, and that such intention had persisted up to and was their intention at
the time of the shooting. The learned trial judge held, and the majority of the
Court of Appeal, that what the three parties did in this case was beyond
preparation and not too remote to constitute an attempt in law.

The evidence is all to the effect
that the three parties had concluded their plan to rob the bank in question on
the previous night. They had obtained the equipment they deemed necessary,
including each a revolver and ammunition, and on the morning in question had
set out in an automobile to accomplish their purpose, that they proceeded to
the block of Renfrew Street upon which the bank was located and where
immediately they would have completed their robbery had the presence of the
police not frustrated their effort.

An attempt is defined in section
72  of the Criminal Code :

72. Every one who, having an
intent to commit an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of
accomplishing his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence intended
whether under the circumstances it was possible to commit such offence or not.

[Page 244]

(2) The question whether an
act done or omitted with intent to commit an offence is or is not only
preparation for the commission of that offence, and too remote to constitute an
attempt to commit it, is a question of law.

Counsel for the accused referred
to a number of cases in which the attempted crime was either against the person
or that of obtaining by false pretences. He contended that any act not
""immediately connected with"" the completed crime would be too remote
to constitute an attempt. Even under the cases which he cited the accused may
still have one or more acts to do, and these be separated by an intervening
period of time, in order to complete the offence and yet may be guilty of an
attempt. This is illustrated with respect to false pretences by Rex v. John
Laitwood [21] and in
a case of murder Rex v. White [22]. In
the latter Bray J., in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal,
stated at p. 129:

*** that the completion or
attempted completion of one of a series of acts intended by a man to result in
killing is an attempt to murder even although this completed act would not,
unless followed by the other acts, result in killing.

Counsel for the accused further
submitted that in order to constitute an attempt there must be ""some
direct association or link between the attemptor and the attemptee"", and
referred to the case of Rex v. Robinson [23]
where Lord Chief Justice Reading stated at p. 349:

We think the conviction must
be quashed, *** upon the broad ground that no communication of any kind of the
false pretence was made to them.

Robinson, with the intention of
obtaining money by false pretences from his underwriters, was engaged in
procuring the evidence upon which he hoped eventually to induce them to pay him
a sum of money. Lord Chief Justice Reading stated that such was preparation and
""only remotely connected with the commission of the full offence"".

A false representation is one of
the essentials in the offence of obtaining by false pretences, but there is
nothing comparable to such nor its communication in a robbery such as Henderson and
his associates were here engaged

[Page 245]

upon. No case has been cited with
respect to this type of offence by which the parties had in any practical sense
covered the distance and in effect reached their objective only to be
frustrated by the police. In the type of offence with which we are here
concerned, it is the sudden and unexpected show of violence that makes the
commission of the crime possible. It seems only proper that such factors should
be taken into account when considering the question of remoteness.

In the Robinson case Lord
Chief Justice Reading quoted at p. 348 as a safe guide the language of Baron
Parke in Rex v. Eagleton [24] at p.
538:

The mere intention to commit
a misdemeanour is not criminal. Some act is required, and we do not think that
all acts towards committing a misdemeanour are indictable. Acts remotely
leading towards the commission of the offence are not to be considered as
attempts to commit it, but acts immediately connected with it are.

Then there is the oft quoted
statement of Blackburn, J. in Rex v. Cheeseman [25].

There is, no doubt, a
difference between the preparation antecedent to an offence, and the actual
attempt. But, if the actual transaction has commenced which would have ended in
the crime if not interrupted, there is clearly an attempt to commit the crime.
Then, applying that principle to this case, it is clear that the transaction
which would have ended in the crime of larceny had commenced here.

In that case the accused was
found guilty of an attempt to steal meat. He had used a false 14-lb. weight in
weighing same, which was discovered before the meat had actually been taken
away. Notwithstanding that fact, he was found guilty of an attempted larceny.

Henderson and his associates had,
with a common intention to rob the Royal Bank, perfected their plan, acquired
the equipment they deemed necessary, including their respective revolvers and
ammunition. All that completed, they had entered upon a course of conduct for
the purpose of immediately accomplishing their object. They had proceeded so
far that within sight of the bank they were frustrated by the presence of the police.
These circumstances in relation to the nature and character of the offence
intended constitute an attempt.

[Page 246]

With deference to those who hold
a contrary view, I am of the opinion that within the meaning of section 72  the
accused Henderson and his associates had committed an attempt to rob
the bank.

The appeal should be allowed and
a new trial directed.

LOCKE J.:—I agree with Mr.
Justice Robertson [26] that
the evidence disclosed that what was done by Henderson, Medos and Carter went
beyond mere preparation for the robbery and that there was evidence upon which
the jury might properly find that there had been an attempt to commit the
offence within sec. 72 (1) of the Code. I also agree with his conclusion
that in spite of the misdirection on this aspect of the matter there was no
prejudice to the accused.

I am, however, of the opinion
that there should be a new trial on the ground that what appears to me to have
been the principal defence of the accused was not adequately put to the jury by
the learned trial Judge. It was conceded in argument before us that Henderson,
with Medos and Carter, formed a common intention to rob the Renfrew Street
branch of the Royal Bank with the aid of firearms and that they were on their
way to the bank to carry out this unlawful purpose when they detected the
presence of the police car in front of the bank whereupon they left the
vicinity. Counsel for the accused, however, disputes the theory of the Crown
that it was part of the original unlawful purpose to resist arrest by violence
after robbing the bank, or that Henderson was a party to such an unlawful
purpose in connection with the attempt, and alternatively contends that if such
had been the purpose it was abandoned by the three men prior to or at the time
they were taken in charge by the police officers: further it is said that in
the case of Henderson his submitting to being disarmed by Detective Hoare and
his conduct after Medos and Carter started to run away indicated that, if there
was then a continuing unlawful purpose on the part of the others to resist
apprehension or to escape from custody by violence, he had disassociated
himself from that purpose in such manner that he was no longer responsible in
law for the unlawful acts of his former confederates. With

[Page 247]

great respect for the learned
trial Judge, I have come to the conclusion that his charge to the jury was
inadequate to put these vital issues clearly before them. It is true that in
the course of dealing with the case for the Crown comment was made on the
question of the abandonment of any unlawful purpose by Henderson and that in
dealing with the defence the matter was mentioned in the following words:—

It was pointed out that Henderson did
not resist, that the movement started at the south end of the line. It was
suggested that Henderson could not do anything else because he was in the
line of fire except to run. It was pointed out that he said: ""I will not
run away, I will give myself up. This is not my gun, it is his."" That was
at the very end of the chapter. It was pointed out that they were walking
slowly on the Flats. It was pointed out that they did not shoot, if they had
such common intention, when Boyes and Ledingham came up, that they did not all
move together, and that by way of explanation of Henderson's conduct
immediately after the shooting you are entitled to take into consideration the
fact he is of tender years, that is to say he is a boy of seventeen.

It was, however, of vital concern
to the accused that the attention of the jury should have been directed to the
actions relied upon by him as evidence of the abandonment of the original
unlawful purpose by the three conspirators and of the acts on his part which it
was contended indicated that he had so disassociated himself from any unlawful
purpose as to relieve him from any criminal responsibility. While no objection
was made at the conclusion of the Judge's charge it was the prisoner's right to
have the jury instructed upon this feature of the case MacAskill v. The
King [27] Duff, J.
at 335.

There should be a new trial.

Appeal allowed,
conviction quashed, and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Incest—Brother and sister—Trial
by jury—Evidence of consanguinity—Admissions by accused—Hearsay—Criminal Code 
section 204 .

The accused was found guilty on a charge of
having committed incest with his sister. At the trial, the proof of
consanguinity was based mostly on two letters which the complainant said she
had received

[Page 334]

from the accused, in one of which he
addressed her as “Sis.” and the other in which he had signed “Brot. Chris.
Smith.” The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction on the ground that there was
no evidence as to the relationship between the accused and the complainant.

Held: A person
accused of incest may admit the relationship and the jury was entitled to treat
both letters as admissions against him and to say that a blood relationship was
meant by the expressions used.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1],
quashing (Roach J.A. dissenting) the conviction of the respondent on a charge
of incest with his sister, contrary to section 204  of the Criminal Code .

The material facts of the case and the questions
at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.

W.B. Common, K.C. for the appellant.

H.W. Allen for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin
J. was delivered by

KERWIN J.:—The accused was found guilty on a
charge that he, well-knowing the complainant Elsie Schmidt to be his sister,
did unlawfully commit incest with her contrary to section 204  of the Criminal
Code . Subsection 1 thereof, so far as applicable,
provides:—“... every brother and sister,... who cohabit or have sexual
intercourse with each other shall each of them, if aware of their
consanguinity, be deemed to have committed incest”. By subsection 2
“brother” and “sister”, respectively, include half-brother and half-sister. The
Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] quashed
the conviction, Roach, J.A., dissenting. The two points upon which there is a
difference of opinion in that Court are: First, whether there was an admission
by the accused of the alleged relationship between him and Elsie Schmidt and,
second, even if that be so, whether that admission was evidence upon which the
jury might convict. These are the sole points for determination in this appeal.

What is relied upon as admissions appears in two
letters written by the accused. The first is dated July 15, 1947, and written
from some place in Saskatchewan to Elsie,

[Page 335]

commencing “Dear Sis” and signed “Chris”. The
second is dated August 6th, 1947, on the letter-head of the Waterloo County
gaol where the accused was at the time incarcerated, having been charged with
the crime of which he was subsequently convicted. This letter is addressed
“Dear Elsie” and is signed “Brat. Chris Smith”. No point is made as to the
surname, either “Schmidt” or “Smith” apparently having been used
indiscriminately. The majority of the Court of Appeal2 were willing
to assume that the abbreviation “Brot” meant brother but were of opinion that
there was no evidence to show in what sense that term and “Dear Sis” were used.
Mr. Justice Aylesworth, speaking for himself and Mr. Justice
Henderson, put the matter thus:

“Sister” and particularly “sis or “Brot”
(if by the latter is meant brother) are not terms by any means restricted to
use between blood relatives. These expressions land themselves with equal
facility to many other relationships for example, an adopted child, or a child
merely taken into a family and raised therein as a family member, readily turns
to their use.

Mr. Justice Roach was of opinion that in
view of the background, to which reference will be made later, the jury were
entitled to accept these terms as evidence of a blood relationship between the
two.

On the second point the majority of the Court of
Appeal2 took the view that if the accused believed he was a brother
of the complainant, there was nothing to show that such a belief was founded on
anything except hearsay. On the other hand, the dissenting judge believed that
what was written by the accused was an admission entitled to be relied upon in
the same way, although not necessarily with the same force, as if the accused,
while in the witness box and while denying the act of intercourse, had under
oath stated that he and Elsie were brother and sister.

The two points may conveniently be considered
together. The background referred to by Mr. Justice Roach appears in his
reasons and in those of Mr. Justice Aylesworth. What follows is taken from
the latter:—

The complainant, Elsie Schmidt, testified
that accused was twenty years her senior and her eldest brother; that neither
of the parents (Sophie and Phillip Smith) had “remarried”; that accused was not
at home very much; that she saw him for the first time when she was at the home
in Saskatchewan and six years of age and for the second time, again in the
home, in 1942 when she was twelve or thirteen years of age; that he

[Page 336]

returned about September, 1944, some two
weeks before she left to attend school in Alberta; that he came again to the
home in the spring of 1946 and stayed there until July 1947 when she came
to her sister in Kitchener; that the accused came to Kitchener where the
offence is alleged to have taken place.

Martha Doherty gave evidence that she was
the sister of the complainant and of the accused; that she was sixteen years
younger than accused; that she lived at home with her parents in Saskatchewan
until 1942 and that up to that time she and all of her sisters and brothers
except the accused, (that is to say, Martha, George, Olga and Elsie) lived at
home; that the first time she remembered the accused coming to the home she was
about ten years of age and that thereafter he was home “off and on” for two or
three months at a time; that “our parents told us he was our brother” and “we
always felt towards him like he was our brother”; that the attitude of the
parents was the same towards the accused as to “The rest of us” that neither of
the parents had married “previously”; that all of the children were children of
the same parents; that her parents came from Russia and that the accused was
born in Russia.

Ordinarily an admission of a fact made by a
party is evidence against him of that fact. The statement in section 1053
of the third edition of Wigmore on Evidence that admissions are not subject to
the rule for testimonial qualifications of personal knowledge is borne out by
the decision, referred to by the author, of the Court of Appeal of Alberta in Stowe
v. Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co.[3],
affirmed in this Court[4]. In
such a case as this there is no reason why a statement by the accused of his
relationship with the complainant is not evidence any more than if he had
stated it in the witness box, as referred to by Roach, J. Certainly the accused
could have pleaded guilty to the charge and in principle and logic I can find
no reason for saying that an admission out of Court is not admissible and
relevant evidence. In Evan Jones[5] the
Court of Criminal Appeal in England decided that an admission, in writing, of a
person charged with incest with his daughter was sufficient to prove the
relationship. In argument before us stress was laid on the fact that in that
case the accused in his notice of appeal at first asked for leave to appeal
against sentence only. That, however, could have had no effect upon the
question as to whether at the time of the trial the father’s evidence, which
was the only evidence, was sufficient to permit the case to go to the jury. The
decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in The King v. Smith[6], where the only evidence as to the

[Page 337] 

relationship of parent and child in a case of
incest was that of the girl, herself, aged eleven years, must be taken as a
decision that in the particular circumstances of that case, the Judge in the
County Court Judge’s Criminal Court was right when he decided that there was
not sufficient proof of relationship.

It should be held that a person accused of this
offence may admit the relationship. It is suggested that there are reasons why
an admission might be taken from a father that would not operate in the case of
brother and sister but circumstances may be imagined where some objection might
in theory be raised even as to the evidence of the mother who at the time of
confinement was in a large hospital. While the guilt of an accused must be
proved beyond reasonable doubt, juries are properly charged not to let fanciful
ideas take possession of their minds in coming to a conclusion as to whether
that onus has been satisfied. With respect, that remark applies to the suggestion
in the present case that the terms “Dear Sis” and “Brot” might have been used
by the accused even if no blood relationship existed.

In the light of all the circumstances detailed
above, the jury were entitled to say that a blood relationship was meant by the
expressions used, and the charge of the trial judge being unobjectionable, the
appeal should be allowed. However, as other questions were raised by the
accused before the Court of Appeal, the proper order is that the case should be
remitted to that Court for further consideration as was done in The King v.
Boak[7] and The
King v. Duer[8].

The judgment of Taschereau, Rand and Kellock JJ.
was delivered by

KELLOCK J.:—The point of dissent upon which this
appeal comes to us is that in the view of the majority there was no evidence as
to the relationship between the accused and the complainant, while the view of
Roach, J.A., dissenting, was that there was both oral and written evidence upon
which the jury properly convicted.

The complainant and her sister, Martha, called
on behalf of the Crown, testified in the first place to treatment of

[Page 338]

the accused as a member of the family and the
sister testified also to statements made to her by her parents that the accused
was their brother. In the third place, there were the two letters which the
complainant said she had received from the accused, in one of which he had
addressed her as “Sis” and the other in which he had signed “Brot. Chris.
Smith”.

Dealing first with the letters, I think the
abbreviation “Brot.” is to be interpreted as having been used as an
abbreviation of the word “brother” and the jury were entitled to treat both
letters, if they considered the handwriting of the accused to have been proved,
as admissions against him.

In Woods v. Woods[9], there was in question a criminal
proceeding for incest against the accused in having intermarried with the
daughter of his own sister. The relationship involved in the present case was
therefore involved in that case, that is, whether the accused and the mother of
the person he had married were brother and sister. Evidence was given as to an
admission made by the accused that the person he had married was his own niece.
Doctor Lushington at page 521 said:

The next point is that we have the
acknowledgment of George Woods himself of the existence of the relationship
between the parties. This is evidence against himself, and similar evidence has
been admitted in criminal cases, even where life has been at stake,...

As to the evidence secondly referred to above, it
is plain that the parents are still alive and living within the jurisdiction.
Accordingly, while it was competent for the sisters to testify as to their
observation of the treatment of the accused in the family, it was not open to
Martha to testify as to statements made to her by her parents when they are
still living, there being no explanation for their not having been called. Pendrell
v. Pendrell[10];
Taylor on Evidence, 12th Ed., 410.

The situation, therefore, is that the jury have
convicted upon a record which contains inadmissible evidence although its
admission was not objected to. The lack of objection, however, is immaterial; Rex
v. Farrell[11]. I do
not think it would be right to allow the conviction to stand on the basis of
the admissible evidence including the admissions in view of the nature of the
admissions in all the

[Page 339]

circumstances. Both the words “Sis” and
“Brother” are used at times in circumstances where there is no blood
relationship and it is for the jury to estimate the weight to be given to them
against the background of the other evidence: Newton v. Belcher[12].

In my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be
allowed and we should make the order which the Court of Appeal ought to have
made, namely, direct a new trial; Northey v. The King[13] and cases cited; Manchuk v. The King[14]; Savard and Lizotte v. The King[15].

Appeal allowed and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Possession of a firearm capable
of being concealed upon the person while committing any criminal offence—Whether
the words “any criminal offence”, The Criminal Code , s. 122 , includes any criminal offence the
essential element of which is the possession of a firearm—The Criminal Code,
R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, s. 122 as re-enacted by S. of C., 1938, c. 44, s. 7.

Held: (Kerwin
J. dissenting)—To avoid the absurdities, inconsistencies or repugnancies which
a perusal of other sections of the Code would otherwise give rise
to, the words “any criminal offence” as used in s. 122 are restricted to an
offence of which the possession of a firearm capable of being concealed upon
the person, is not an essential element. In the result Rex. v. Maskiew
(1945) 53 Man. R., 281, overruled.

Per Kerwin J.
(dissenting)—By themselves the words “any criminal offence” do not admit of two
interpretations and therefore the applicable rule is that set out in Grey v.
Pearson 6 H.L. Cas. 61 at 106; Victoria City v. Bishop of
Vancouver Island, [1921] A.C. 384 at 387.

Another principle in the construction of
statutes applicable to s. 122 is: “If the words of an Act are clear, you must
follow them, even though they lead to a manifest absurdity”—Reg. v. Judge
of City of London Court, (1892) 1 Q.B. 273, 290; Cook v. Charles A.
Vogaler Co., [1901] A.C., 102, 107. The remedy lies with Parliament and not
with the Courts—Canadian Performing Right Society v. Famous Players Canadian
Corp. [1929] A.C. 456 at 460.

APPEAL by leave granted under
section 1025  of the Criminal Code , from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[1]
quashing a conviction of the respondent. The respondent was charged on two
counts. The first laid under section 446 (c) of the Code, alleged
robbery while armed; the second, laid under section 122 of the Code, alleged
possession of a firearm capable of being concealed upon the person while
committing a criminal offence. The accused pleaded guilty to the first charge
and not guilty to the second. He was convicted on both and sentenced to two
years imprisonment on the first, and to an additional two years on the second.
He appealed his conviction on the second charge.

W.P. Common, K.C. for the appellant.

Arthur E. Maloney for the respondent.

[Page 509]

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Estey, J.
was delivered by:

ESTEY J.:—The accused, Peter Quon, on the early
morning of the 30th of March, 1947, entered a restaurant in the City of Toronto
and there, armed with a revolver, intimidated and robbed the proprietor, Sam
Lun, of $75. In the proceedings that followed he pleaded guilty to an offence
contrary to section 446 (c) of the Criminal Code , and was
found guilty of an offence of having on his person a revolver, contrary to
section 122  of the Criminal Code . He was sentenced under
sec. 446 (c) to a term of two years in the penitentiary and to a
further term of two years under sec. 122 .

The Crown appeals from a judgment of the
Appellate Court for Ontario quashing the conviction under the second count on
the basis that the words “any criminal offence” in sec. 122  “do not
include any criminal offence an essential element of which is the possession
upon the person of a pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed
upon the person.”

The learned Judges of the Appellate Court while
of the opinion that the words “any criminal offence” standing by themselves
were exhaustive and would include every offence created by the Code, were
of the opinion that Parliament did not intend these words as used in
sec. 122  should be given that exhaustive meaning but rather the restricted
meaning above indicated. In this regard the learned Judges disagreed with the
decision of Rex v. Maskiew[2] a
decision of the Appellate Court in Manitoba.

Sec. 122  reads as follows:

122. Everyone who has upon his person a
rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed upon
the person while committing any criminal offence is guilty of an offence
against this section and liable to imprisonment for a term not less than
two years in addition to any penalty to which he may be sentenced for the first
mentioned offence, and an offence against this section shall be punishable
either on indictment or summary conviction in the same manner as the first
mentioned offence.

(2) Such imprisonment shall be served after
undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be sentenced for
the first mentioned offence.

Sections 118  to 129  of the Criminal Code 
were repealed in 1933 and as re-enacted embody several material changes.

[Page 510]

Sec. 122 , prior thereto sec. 120, was
one of these sections. As amended it applied only to a pistol, revolver or
other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person (the rifle and shotgun
were added in 1938). At the same session Parliament enacted sec. 118  and
provided that “every one * * * who not having a permit in
Form 76, has upon his person, elsewhere than in his own dwelling house,
shop * * * a pistol, revolver, or other firearm, capable of
being concealed upon the person” is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. The identical
weapons are dealt with in 1933 in both secs. 118 and 122. The learned
Judges of the Appellate Court point out that a literal construction of the
language used in 1922 would result in that one found guilty under 118 is also
guilty of an offence under sec. 122  and liable to a further minimum term
of two years imprisonment. The learned Judges also referred to secs. 115, 116,
117, 123 and 124, and pointed out that with respect to these a similar
absurdity or repugnancy would result.

Then with respect to the offence of burglary
under sec. 457, paragraph (2) thereof provides:

457. (2) Every one convicted of an offence
under this section who when arrested, or when he committed such offence,
had upon his person any offensive weapon, shall, in addition to the
imprisonment above prescribed, be liable to be whipped.

This subsection covers with respect to
burglary all that sec. 122  provides for if the latter be given the meaning
contended for by the Crown. It cannot be that Parliament intended sec. 122 
should apply to burglary in view of the provisions of sec. 457(2).

The foregoing absurdities, inconsistencies or
repugnancies are such as to justify a Court adopting that construction of the
language in sec. 122  as may avoid them, In Grey v. Pearson[3] at p. 104, Lord Wensleydale stated:

I have been long and deeply impressed with
the wisdom of the rule, now, I believe, universally adopted, at least in the
Courts of Law in Westminster Hall, that in construing wills and indeed
statutes, and all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of
the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity, or
some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case
the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as to avoid
that absurdity and inconsistency, but no further.

This passage has been repeatedly approved.

[Page 511]

The construction given to this section by
the learned Judges of the Appellate Court avoids these absurdities and
repugnancies. Moreover, that construction seems to be supported by a perusal of
many sections of the Code. The group of sections such as 115
to 129 deal in the main with custody and possession of the specified weapons
under certain circumstances; then the offences such as sec. 264 (attempts
murder); sec. 273 (wounding with intent); sec. 446  (robbery) cover
those cases in which the weapons are used in the manner as therein described.
In all of these latter offences the maximum punishment provided is life
imprisonment. In those sections where possession or custody is the basis
of the offence, Parliament has in mind the mischief or risk to the public
occasioned by the possession of one of these firearms. Apart from 122 there is
no section that deals with the having, with or without a permit, the
firearms specified in 122 upon the person of one while committing a criminal
offence. A firearm upon the person of a criminal while committing an offence is
fraught with the greatest possible danger to the public, when detected, he
resorts to his firearm with usually serious and sometimes fatal consequences to
one or more of the public. It is in sec. 122 , as in the other
sections with which it is associated under the heading “Offensive Weapons”,
that Parliament seeks to punish and to that extent to protect the public
against the possession or custody of these firearms and thereby avoid the
consequences already suggested.

The construction adopted by the Court of Appeal
removes the absurdities, inconsistencies and repugnancies, and in my opinion is
consistent with the position of sec. 122  in the Code in relation to
the other offences.

The appeal should be dismissed.

KERWIN J. (dissenting):—By leave granted under
section 1025  of the Criminal Code , the Attorney-General of Ontario
appeals to this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for that province[4] quashing a conviction of the respondent
Quon. The basis of the reasons for that decision, delivered by Mr. Justice
Roach on behalf of the Court, is that the words “any criminal offence” in
section 122 of the Code do not include a criminal offence an
essential element

[Page 512]

of which is the possession upon the person of a
pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.
Section 122  at the relevant time was as follows:—

122. (1) Every one who has upon his person
a rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed
upon the person while committing any criminal offence is guilty of an offence
against this section and liable to imprisonment for a term not less than
two years in addition to any penalty to which he may be sentenced for the first
mentioned offence, and an offence against this section shall be punishable
either on indictment or summary conviction in the same manner as the first
mentioned offence.

(2) Such imprisonment shall be served after
undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be sentenced for
the first mentioned offence.

Quon was convicted of an offence under this
section and it was that conviction that was set aside. He had already
pleaded guilty to a charge that at the City of Toronto on or about the 30th day
of March, 1947, being armed with an offensive weapon, to wit, a pistol, he
robbed Sam Lun of the sum of $75 in money, which charge was laid under
section 446(c) of the Code:—

446. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for life and to be whipped who

* * *

(c) being armed with an offensive weapon or
instrument robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person.

It is common ground that the pistol mentioned in
this charge is the same pistol referred to in the charge under
section 122 .

The reasoning of the Court of Appeal applies
even though an accused has never been convicted or even charged under
section 446  and, as pointed out by Roach J.A., the decision is in conflict
with the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in Rex v. Maskiew [5]. Chief Justice Macpherson in that case
gives the history of the two sections of the Code set out above and
in my view that history emphasizes the all inclusiveness of the words “any
criminal offence” in section 122 . Even though some of the results set out
by Mr. Justice Roach may in certain circumstances ensue, I am unable, with
respect, for that reason, to cut down the meaning of those plain unambiguous
words.

By themselves the words do not admit of two
interpretations and therefore the applicable rule is set out by Lord

[Page 513]

Atkinson, speaking for the Judicial Committee,
in Victoria City v. Bishop of Vancouver Island[6] in the second paragraph of the
following extract at 387-388:—

In the construction of statutes their words
must be interpreted in their ordinary grammatical sense, unless there be
something in the context, or in the object of the statute in which they occur,
or in the circumstances with reference to which they are used, to show that
they were used in a special sense different from their ordinary grammatical
sense. In Grey v. Pearson[7] Lord
Wensleydale said: “I have been long and deeply impressed with the wisdom of the
rule, now I believe, universally adopted, at least in the Courts of Law in
Westminster Hall, that in construing wills, and indeed statutes, and all
written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be
adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity, or some repugnance or
inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical
and ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as to avoid that absurdity
and inconsistency, but no farther.” Lord Blackburn quoted this passage with
approval in Caledonian Ry. Co. v. North British Ry. Co.[8], as did also Jessel M.R. in Ex parte
Walton[9].

There is another principle in the
construction of statutes specially applicable to this section. It is thus
stated by Lord Esher in Reg. v. Judge of the City of London Court[10]:

“If the words of an Act are clear, you must
follow them, even though they lead to a manifest absurdity. The Court has
nothing to do with the question whether the legislature has committed an
absurdity. In my opinion, the rule has always been this:—If the words of an Act
admit of two interpretations, then they are not clear; and if one interpretation
leads to an absurdity, and the other does not, the Court will conclude that the
legislature did not intend to lead to an absurdity, and will adopt the other
interpretation.” And Lord Halsbury in Cooke v. Charles A. Vogeler Co.[11] said: “But a court of law has nothing to
do with the reasonableness or unreasonableness of a provision, except so far as
it may help them in interpreting what the legislature has said.” Which
necessarily means that for this latter purpose it is legitimate to take into
consideration the reasonableness or unreasonableness of any provision of a
statute.

Again a section of a statute should,
if possible, be construed so that there may be no repugnancy or inconsistency
between its different portions or members.

I have quoted these three paragraphs because
Lord Wensleydale’s statement in Gray v. Pearson, referred to in the
first paragraph, has been relied upon by the Court of Appeal in coming to its
conclusion but since there is no ambiguity in the words themselves, “any
criminal offence”, the relevant rule in my opinion, as I have stated, is that
set forth in the second paragraph. It is true that there are cases in the books
where the meaning of a word of general import

[Page 514]

has been restricted. Examples of such cases are River
Wear Commissioners v. Adamson[12] and Cox
v. Hakes[13], but
no decision of authority can be found to say that where, as here, two offences
are created by the same Act, a general expression found in one section is
to be cut down because a Court may think such construction would lead to some
inconvenience or absurdity. The remarks of Lord Chief Justice Reading, speaking
for the Court of Criminal Appeal in Frederick Miles[14], at 15, are appropriate: “But it is
perfectly plain that in such a case as this, if a jury have given a verdict for
one offence, a jury can give a verdict for another offence.” Here, there is a
separate and distinct offence created by section 122  and what I consider,
with deference, to be the plain intent of Parliament must be given effect to.
The remedy lies with Parliament and not with the Courts, as pointed out in the
judgment of the Judicial Committee in Canadian Performing Right Society v. Famous
Players Canadian Corp.[15] at
460:—

Strenuous efforts, however, have been made by
counsel for the appellants to induce their Lordships to accept a
construction other than the literal one, and it is necessary therefore to
consider whether such a construction is the correct one. Great stress is laid
by the appellants on the extreme inconvenience of a literal construction. It
may, it is said, be practically impossible, when occasion arises to register an
assignment, to obtain a duplicate without which, as it would appear,
registration is impossible.

One answer to this argument is that it
ought to be addressed to the legislature and not to the tribunal of
construction, whose duty it is to say what the words mean, not what they should
be made to mean in order to avoid inconvenience or hardship.

Counsel for the accused argued that he was
entitled to uphold the order setting aside the conviction upon the ground of res
judicata. The members of the Court of Appeal were unanimous and, if they
really decided the point against the accused, the latter has not the right to
ask us to determine it as that would in effect permit him to appeal to this
Court in a case not provided for by the Code. In an early part of his
judgment, Mr. Justice Roach states: “In my opinion it is clear that the
appellant has a complete defence to the second charge but it is not the defence
of res judicata” but, towards the end, after referring to a
number of cases cited on behalf of the accused, he continues: “On my
interpretation of section 122 , neither

[Page 515]

the defence of autrefois convict or res
judicata has any application.” I take it from these two extracts that the
Court of Appeal did not consider the defence of res judicata and, if
that be so, the proper order is that the case be remitted to that Court in
order that it may pass upon that defence: The King v. Boak[16]. On the other hand, if the Court of Appeal
decided the point against the accused, the result will be that his conviction
will be affirmed.

TASCHEREAU J.—The Attorney General for Ontario
appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeal, unanimously quashing the
conviction of the respondent Quon. Special leave to appeal was granted by the
Honourable Mr. Justice Estey, on the ground that this judgment conflicts
on a question of law with a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Province of
Manitoba, Rex v. Maskiew[17].

The respondent was charged on two counts:

1. That at the City of Toronto on or about
the 30th day of March, 1947, being armed with an offensive weapon, to wit: a
pistol, he robbed Sam Lun of the sum of $75 in money, the property of Melody
Lunch and Sam Lun, contrary to the Criminal Code .

2. And further, at the City of Toronto on
or about the 30th day of March, 1947, he had upon his person a pistol or
revolver or firearm, capable of being concealed upon the person while
committing a criminal offence, contrary to the Criminal Code .

The respondent pleaded guilty to the first count
and not guilty to the second. He was sentenced on the first charge to two years
in the Penitentiary, and having been found guilty on the second charge, he was
sentenced to a further term of two years consecutive.

The charge under the first count was laid
pursuant to the provisions of section 446 (c) of the Criminal Code 
which reads as follows:

446 (c). Robbery while armed.—Being
armed with an offensive weapon or instrument robs, or assaults with intent to
rob, any person.

The charge under the second count was made
pursuant to section 122 , which is as follows:

122. Armed while committing offence.—Everyone
who has upon his person a rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or any firearm
capable of being concealed upon the person while committing any criminal
offence is guilty of an offence against this section and liable to
imprisonment for a term not less than two years in addition to any penalty to
which he may be

[Page 516]

sentenced for the first mentioned offence,
and an offence against this section shall be punishable either on
indictment or summary conviction in the same manner as the first mentioned
offence.

(2) Such imprisonment shall be served after
undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be sentenced for
the first mentioned offence.

It is common ground that on the 30th day of
March, 1947, the respondent entered a restaurant of which the proprietor was
Sam Lun, at the south-west corner of Carleton and Jarvis Streets in the City of
Toronto. The respondent had a revolver in his hand and intimidated the
proprietor and robbed him of about $75. It is to be noted that the charge on
the first count relates to the 30th day of March, 1947, and that the charge on
the second count also relates to the same date. It is admitted that the
revolver which Quon had in his hand and the possession of which is an essential
element of the crime committed under the first count, is the same offensive
weapon which can be concealed, and which is mentioned in the second count.

This section 122 which is an amendment to
the Criminal Code  (1938), was enacted in order to increase the
punishment when certain crimes are committed while the authors are bearers of
arms which may be concealed, and which give to the offences a more dangerous
character. It has however very far reaching consequences which the draftsman
obviously did not all foresee. It applies to anyone who while committing any
criminal offence has on his person a weapon which may be concealed. It
would therefore apply to a man who, while writing a defamatory libel, has a
revolver in his pocket, or to a person for example who, while violating the
provisions of sections 221  and 222  of the Criminal Code  relating to
common nuisances, is in possession of an arm which may be concealed. But,
fortunately, we have not to decide these cases, and they are matters to be
dealt with by the proper legislative authorities, and not by the judiciary.

The question put before this Court is:

Does section 122 of the Criminal
Code  find its application, when it is an essential element of the “criminal
offence”, that the guilty person be the bearer of an offensive weapon? (a
revolver in the present case).

It is submitted that the plain grammatical
interpretation of section 122, is that the section applies to any
person who, while committing any criminal offence, has upon his

[Page 517]

person a rifle, shotgun, pistol, revolver or any
firearm capable of being concealed upon the person. It is argued that the
language of this section is plain and unambiguous and that the judgment of
the Court of Appeal is wrong in that the principles applied by that Court in
its reasons for judgment are to be applied, only when the language of the
statute to be interpreted, is ambiguous and capable of more than one meaning.

I do not think that this reasoning applies here.
If the Crown’s contention is adopted, it will mean that the respondent is to be
punished for a robbery of $75 when armed with a revolver, and that he will
receive an additional punishment because he had on his person that very same
revolver, which was an element of the first criminal offence.

I have had the occasion of reading the reasons
for judgment of my brother Kellock, and I agree with him that Parliament never
contemplated such an unreasonable and shocking result. Words are primarily to
be construed in their popular sense unless such a construction would lead to a
manifest absurdity. If they lead to an absurdity, the words may be modified so
as to avoid it. (Halsbury’s Laws of England, 2nd Ed. Vol. 31, at pages 480, 482
and 483).

I believe that this rule must be applied here,
and that it should be held that the words “any criminal offence”, found in
section 122 mean an offence, where the possession of a firearm susceptible
of being concealed, is not an element.

I think that the Court of Appeal of Ontario was
right in its conclusion, and I would therefore dismiss this appeal.

KELLOCK J.:—The respondent was charged in the
County Court Judge’s Criminal Court on two counts as follows:

1. That at the City of Toronto on or about
the 30th day of March, 1947, being armed with an offensive weapon, to wit a
pistol, he robbed Sam Lum of the sum of $75 in money, the property of Melody
Lunch and Sam Lun, contrary to the Criminal Code .

2. And further that at the City of Toronto
on or about the 30th day of March, 1947, he had upon his person a pistol or
revolver or fire-arm capable of being concealed upon the person while
committing a criminal offence contrary to the Criminal Code .

He pleaded guilty to the first count and not
guilty to the second count. Evidence was submitted on the second count and he
was found guilty. The sentence on the first count was two years in the
penitentiary and on the second

[Page 518]

count a further term of two years. The charge
under the first count was laid under the provisions of section 446 (c)
of the Criminal Code  and that under the second under section 122 .

The facts are not in dispute. In the early
morning of the 30th of March, 1947, the respondent entered a restaurant in the
City of Toronto, the proprietor of which was one Sam Lun. Respondent had a
revolver in his hand and with it intimidated Lun, and effected the robbery. It
is common ground that both charges arise out of these circumstances and that
the pistol referred to in the second charge is the same pistol as is referred
to in the first charge.

On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario the
appeal was allowed and it was held that the words “any criminal offence” in
section 122 do not include an offence an essential element of which is the
possession of a firearm capable of being concealed upon the person. The Crown
now appeals pursuant to leave granted, on the ground of conflict between the
judgment here in question and the decision of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba
in Rex. v. Maskiew[18].

The relevant sections of the Code are
as follows:

445. Robbery is theft accompanied with
violence or threats of violence to any person or property used to extort the
property stolen, or to prevent or overcome resistance to its being stolen.

446. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for life and to be whipped who

(c) being armed with an offensive
weapon or instrument robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person;

447. Every one who commits robbery is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to fourteen years’ imprisonment and
to be whipped.

Section 122, as enacted by 2 Geo. VI, cap.
44, section 7, reads as follows:

122. (1) Every one who has upon his person
a rifle, shot-gun, pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed
upon the person while committing any criminal offence is guilty of an offence
against this section and liable to imprisonment for a term not less than
two years in addition to any penalty to which he may be sentenced for the first
mentioned offence, and an offence against this section shall be punishable
either on indictment or summary conviction in the same manner as the first
mentioned offence.

(2) Such imprisonment shall be served after
undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be sentenced for
the first mentioned offence.

[Page 519]

On the view of the appellant as to the effect of
these two sections, the possession of the revolver by the respondent in the
commission of the robbery took the respondent out of section 445 and
raised the offence to one within section 446 (c), while at the same
time, the same fact, i.e., the possession of the revolver constituted an
additional and separate offence within section 122.

In approaching the question as to the proper view
to be taken of the meaning of the statute, I think there are well settled
principles to be kept in mind. The first is illustrated by Wemys v. Hopkins[19]. In that case a complaint was preferred
against the appellant under 5 and 6 Wm. IV, c. 50 (1), s. 78, for that being
the driver of a carriage on a highway, by negligence or wilful misbehaviour,
viz., by striking a certain horse ridden by the respondent, caused her hurt and
damage. The appellant was convicted on this charge and fined. Subsequently a
complaint was preferred against him under 24 and 25 Vict., c. 100, s. 42, for
that he did on the same date as that in question on the first complaint and by
reason of the same conduct, unlawfully assault, strike, and otherwise abuse the
respondent. On this charge he was also convicted and fined. The question for
the court was whether, the appellant having been convicted on the first, could
also be convicted on the second complaint. It was held he could not. Blackburn,
J., at p. 381 said:

The defence does not arise on a plea of
autrefois convict, but on the well established rule at common law, that when a
person has been convicted and punished for an offence by a court of competent
jurisdiction, transit in rem judicatam, that is, the conviction shall be
a bar to all further proceedings for the same offence, and he shall not be
punished again for the same matter; otherwise there might be two different
punishments for the same offence * * * It is necessary in
the present case to have it proved * * * that on a former
occasion the appellant was charged with the same assault, although not in the
same words, yet in terms the same, and that he was then convicted and punished.

The above principle is embodied in
section 14 of the Code. The common law principle is as applicable,
in my opinion, in the case of two sections of the same statute as in the
case of separate statutes.

There is also to be borne in mind the second
principle, as stated by Cockburn, C.J., in Queen v. Elrington[20] at 696, viz.: “the well established
principle of our criminal

[Page 520]

law that a series of charges shall not be
preferred and, whether a party accused of a minor offence is acquitted or
convicted, he shall not be charged again on the same facts in a more aggravated
form”. Section 907 embodies this latter principle.

It is obvious of course that Parliament may, if
it sees fit, constitute two separate offences out of the same act or omission
or make part of an act or omission or one or more of a series of acts or
omissions a separate offence additional to that constituted by the complete act
or omission or the whole series.

In the light of the principles referred to,
which are fundamental principles of the criminal law, one asks one’s self
whether Parliament has in fact as to the statutory provisions here in question,
departed from these principles and shown the intention that the possession of a
firearm in the commission of the offence of robbery, which thereby raises the
offence to that of armed robbery, shall also constitute a separate and distinct
offence under section 122. In other words, does the statute, taken as a
whole, indicate that the words “any criminal offence” in section 122 are
used in other than their literal all inclusive sense?

The argument for the appellant is based squarely
upon the literal interpretation of this phrase. Where statutory language admits
of only one meaning, then, of course no other meaning may be applied but it is
the intention of the legislature upon the whole statute that is the determining
factor. The matter is put thus in Maxwell, On the Interpretation of
Statutes, 7th Ed. p. 2.

The first and most elementary rule of
construction is that it is to be assumed that the words and phrases of
technical legislation are used in their technical meaning if they have acquired
one, and; otherwise, in their ordinary meaning; and, secondly, that the phrases
and sentences are to be construed according to the rules of grammar. From these
presumptions it is not allowable to depart where the language admits of no
other meaning. Nor should there be any departure from them where the language
under consideration is susceptible of another meaning, unless adequate grounds
are found, either in the history or cause of the enactment or in the context or
in the consequences which would result from the literal interpretation, for
concluding that that interpretation does not give the real intention of the
Legislature. If there is nothing to modify, nothing to alter, nothing to
qualify, the language which the statute contains, it must be construed in the
ordinary and natural meaning of the words and sentences. The great fundamental
principal is:—

“In construing wills and, indeed, statutes
and all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is
to be adhered to,

[Page 521]

unless that would lead to some absurdity,
or some repugnancy or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which
case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified so as to
avoid that absurdity and inconsistency, but no farther.”

However, the mere use of a general word, even
the “any” does not end the matter. In Cox v. Hakes[21] Lord Halsbury, L.C., at p. 517 said:

* * * it is impossible to
contend that the mere fact of a general word being used in a statute precludes
all inquiry into the object of the statute or the mischief which it was
intended to remedy.

While it was in that case admitted that the case
with which the House was dealing fell within the literal meaning of the statute
this meaning was rejected. In the words of Lord Bramwell at p. 526:

* * * if the result would be
futile, or lead to an absurdity, the right way of dealing with those words is
to put a limit on them;

In River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson[22] where the House had to deal with a similar
question, Lord Blackburn said at page 763:

In all cases the object is to see what is
the intention expressed by the words used. But, from the imperfection of
language, it is impossible to know what that intention is without inquiring
farther, and seeing what the circumstances were with reference to which the
words were used, and what was the object, appearing from those circumstances,
which the person using them had in view; for the meaning of words varies
according to the circumstances with respect to which they were used.

And at page 764 he said:

* * * and I believe that it
is not disputed that what Lord Wensleydale used to call the golden rule is
right, viz., that we are to take the whole statute together, and construe it
all together, giving the words their ordinary signification, unless when so
applied they produce an inconsistency, or an absurdity or inconvenience so
great as to convince the Court that the intention could not have been to use
them in their ordinary signification, and to justify the Court in putting on
them some other signification, which, though less proper, is one which the
Court thinks the words will bear.

In Astor v. Perry[23] the principle of the above authorities was
applied again to the word “any” and additional words were implied by the House
to give a limiting meaning to the general language used in the statute.

What is meant by “absurdity” is well explained
by Lord Blackburn in Rhodes v. Rhodes[24]
at 205, where he said, quoting Lord Cranworth in Thelluson v. Rendlesham[25]:

[Page 522]

The rule on which the appellant relies is
that universally recognized and acted on, namely, that words are to be
construed according to their plain ordinary meaning unless the context shows
them to have been used in a different sense, or unless the rule, if acted on,
would lead to some manifest absurdity or incongruity; indeed, the latter branch
of the rule is, perhaps, involved in the former, for, supposing that the rule,
if acted on, would lead to manifest absurdity or incongruity, the context must
be considered to shew that the words could not have been used in their ordinary
sense.

Lord Blackburn continued:

Lord Wensleydale once more repeated the
rule as laid down in Warburton v. Loveland[26] but it is worth observing that by “an
absurdity” can hardly be meant a result which the Court who construe the will
thought ought not to have been the intention of the testator. If that had been
so, the Thelluson will itself would have been upset. LordSt. Leonards
says, p. 509, that much thought and learning had been bestowed for the purpose
of endeavouring “to counteract, and properly too, if it could be done, the
ambitious views of the testator,” but the intention was too clearly expressed.
Lord Cranworth, therefore, seems quite correct when he says that the latter
branch of the rule is but a means by the context of shewing that the words were
not used in their ordinary sense, as it is not to be presumed that the testator
meant an absurdity; but that if it is shewn that it was intended to use them so
as to work this absurdity, that intention, if it be not illegal, must be
carried out.

It is necessary to see therefore whether there
is anything to indicate the sense in which the words here in question were
used.

The ancestor of section 122, so far as I
have been able to trace it back, is section 2 of 40 Victoria, (1877), cap.
30: “An Act to make provision against the improper use of Firearms.”
Sections 2 and 3 of that statute read as follows:

2. Whosoever, when arrested either on a
warrant issued against him for an offence or whilst committing an offence, has
upon his person a pistol or air gun, shall be liable on conviction thereof to a
fine of not less than twenty dollars or more than fifty dollars, or to
imprisonment in any gaol or place of confinement for a term not exceeding three
months.

3. Whosoever has upon his person a pistol
or air gun, with intent therewith unlawfully and maliciously to do injury to
any other person, shall be liable on conviction thereof, to a fine of not less
than fifty or more than two hundred dollars, or to imprisonment in any gaol or
place of confinement for a term not exceeding six months:

(2) The intent aforesaid may be prima
facie inferred from the fact of the pistol or air gun being on the person.

It is evident that the question which is
involved in the present appeal arose in 1877 on the enactment of the original
legislation. If the argument for the Crown is sound, the proper construction of
these two sections is that you take the conduct described by
section 3 as constituting the

[Page 523]

offence therein provided for, and automatically
you also take a part of that same conduct and, by adding it to its whole, make
out the additional offence under section 2. In my opinion statutory
language which produces such a result should be very clear and free from all
indication of a contrary intent. I think the language here under consideration
does indicate such a contrary intent.

Parliament has, in my opinion, provided in
section 3 that the totality of the conduct there described shall
constitute one offence punishable by a fine of not more than two hundred
dollars or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months. How can
effect be given to this clear and unambiguous expression of intention in
section 3 except by construing section 2, as Roach, J.A., has
construed the present section 122, as applying only to offences which do
not include as an element thereof any of the conduct described in
section 3, or more specifically, the possession upon the person of a
pistol or air gun?

Again, to read the two sections together in
accordance with the contention of the appellant they would read somewhat as
follows:

Whosoever when arrested whilst having upon
his person a pistol or air gun with intent etc., which intent may be inferred
from the fact of possession, has upon his person, a pistol or air gun shall be
liable to conviction * * *

To so read the sections is to reduce them
to the merest tautology and to render them absurd. I think therefore that the
statute provides the necessary internal evidence that these sections are
to be read in accordance with the principle applied by Roach, J.A.

Coming to the Code as it now stands, one
finds that section 122 is embodied in a group of sections commencing
with section 115. When these are examined the same consideration appears
as in the case of sections 2 and 3 of the Act of 1877. For instance,
section 118 , as enacted by 23-24 Geo. V., cap. 25, section 1,
is as follows:

118. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,
who, not having a permit in form 76,—

(a) has upon his person, elsewhere
than in his own dwelling house, shop, warehouse, counting house, or premises, a
pistol, revolver, or other firearm, capable of being concealed upon the person;

[Page 524]

If a person is without the statutory permit he
is guilty of the offence described by this section if he has upon his
person in the circumstances mentioned, a firearm capable of being concealed.
For the totality of this conduct the penalty prescribed by Parliament is
a term not exceeding five years. If the appellant’s argument be sound,
the existence of one element of this very conduct would subject the defendant
to an additional penalty of two years merely by the process of a separate
charge being laid against him under the provisions of section 122. It
seems to me that Parliament, in the use of the phrase “not exceeding” in
section 118 , has clearly indicated that that section is exhaustive as
far as the conduct to which it relates is concerned, and that therefore
section 122 is to be confined in its operation, notwithstanding the use of
the words “any offence”, to offences of which the possession of a firearm
capable of being concealed upon the person is not an element.

The same situation arises under many of the
sections in the group and I think they are to be construed in the same
manner. Section 129 , however, as enacted by 23-24 Geo. V., cap. 25,
section 1, does not include in the offence thereby created the possession
or use of offensive weapons and the above reasoning would therefore not apply
to it.

The force of the considerations above set out is
enhanced when section 457 is referred to. The section reads as
follows:

457. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for life who

(a) breaks and enters a dwelling-house
by night with intent to commit any indictable offence therein; or

(b) breaks out of any dwelling-house
by night, either after committing an indictable offence therein, or after
having entered such dwelling-house, either by day or by night, with intent to
commit an indictable offence therein.

2. Every one convicted of an offence under
this section who when arrested, or when he committed such offence, had
upon his person any offensive weapon, shall, in addition to the imprisonment
above prescribed, be liable to be whipped.

In my opinion it would be absurd to say that a
person liable to conviction under the provisions of subsection 2 is also
liable to be convicted under the provisions of section 122, if the
offensive weapon is a firearm. The absurdity

[Page 525]

of such a construction is heightened by the fact
that the penalty provided by section 457, subsection 1, is
imprisonment for life.

Coming to section 446 (c), Parliament
has by this provision, declared that for that offence, involving as one of its
main elements, the presence on the offender of an offensive weapon, the penalty
may be imprisonment for life and whipping. That is expressly the penalty for
the totality of that conduct. I do not think therefore, that there is to be
attributed to Parliament the intention that one part of that conduct (where the
weapon in question is a firearm) may be made the subject of a separate charge
under section 122, a procedure which would be ineffective and absurd where
the maximum penalty had been imposed. In any case where the maximum is not
imposed, it is to be taken that it is because the trial tribunal did not
consider that the conduct involved merited such a penalty. Surely it cannot be
said that in such a case Parliament has expressed the intention, nonetheless,
that the same tribunal may be called upon to impose an additional penalty for
the same conduct under the guise of a separate charge. While it is the fact
that in the case of the offences provided for by clauses (a) and (b)
of section 446 , the penalty is the same as in the case of an offence under
clause (c), an offensive weapon is not there in either case involved.
The same considerations therefore do not apply as in a case under clause (c).

It is quite true that under the provisions of
section 122, subsection 1, a conviction for the offence thereby
provided does not depend upon a conviction for the other offence to which the
subsection refers but it does depend upon such offence being proved to
have been in fact committed. I do not think, therefore, that this situation has
any bearing upon the construction of the section from the standpoint above
set forth.

In my opinion, therefore, Roach, J.A., was right
in the conclusion to which he came.

In Rex v. Maskiew[27], the following, which is the ratio decidendi
of the judgment of the Chief Justice, occurs at p. 143:

Section 122 is for the purpose of
governing the carrying of firearms. In its original form, in 1886, the
section was comparatively simple and

[Page 526]

the punishment not severe; but conditions and
the increase of crime having made it necessary to amend same for the protection
of the public, the amendments of 1932 and subsequent years indicate the
importance of prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons and that there
should be a certainty of additional punishment imposed upon a convicted
criminal found in such possession. If it had been the intention of the
Legislature to have made a special exemption of a conviction under s. 446 (c),
it would have been quite easy to have done so; but the section does not
make any exception.

This appears to say that because a general word
has been used without any express exception, the literal interpretation must be
applied. With respect, the authorities to which I have referred establish that
that is not the law.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

1948: May 12; 1948: June 25.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal Law—Evidence—Corroboration—Unsworn testimony of
child of tender years—Offence, under section 301 (2)  of Criminal Code , of
carnally knowing girl between the ages of 14 and 16 years—Canada Evidence Act ,
section 16 (2) —Criminal Code , sections 301 (2) , 1002 , 1003 , 1023 .

Held: The corroboration required by section 301 '(2) of
the Criminal Code  cannot be found in the unsworn testimony of a child of tender
years, unless this unsworn testimony is corroborated by some other material
evidence.

[Page 350]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming (Letourneau C.J. and Casey
J.A. dissenting) the conviction of the appellant on a charge of carnal knowledge
of a girl between the ages of 14 and 16 years.

A. Chevalier, K.C. and J. J. Bertrand for the appellant.

P. E. Delaney, K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau, Estey
and Locke JJ. was delivered by

Estey J.:—The
accused was convicted of having carnal knowledge of a girl between the ages of
fourteen and sixteen, contrary to section 301 (2)  of the Criminal Code . The
latter part of the foregoing subsection reads as follows :

… no person accused of any offence under this subsection
shall be convicted upon the evidence of one witness, unless such witness is
corroborated in some material particular by evidence implicating the accused.

The Court of King's Bench in Quebec (Appeal Side) 2
affirmed the conviction, but:

Messieurs les juges en chef Létourneau et Casey
sont dissidents et feraient droit à l'appel, par le motif que le
témoignage de la plaignante, Emélie Gauvin, n'est pas corroboré suivant les
exigences des articles 301  et 1002  du
Code Criminel  du Canada.

The appellant, on the basis of this dissent, appeals to this
Court under the provisions of section 1023  of the Criminal Code .

The Magistrate presiding in the Court of Sessions of the
Peace in finding the accused guilty found the required corroboration of the
girl's evidence in that of her brother, a boy at the time of the alleged
offence about ten years of age, whose evidence was received without oath (at
the trial about three years after the date of the alleged offence) under
section 16  of the Canada Evidence Act .

The Magistrate in the course of his reasons for finding the
accused guilty stated:

It is true that the boy's evidence was unsworn, but in a
case of Rex v. Hamlin, (52 C.C.C. 149) it was decided :—
""corroborative evidence of the complainant's evidence on a charge
of carnal knowledge, may be found in the evidence of another girl of
tender age tendered as a witness, although such evidence was given NOT under
oath.""

[Page 351]

If a child of tender years does not understand the nature of
an oath, it is provided in section 16  of the Canada Evidence Act  that
the evidence of such child may be received if, in the opinion of the judge
trying the case, such child is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify
the reception of the evidence and understands the duty of speaking the truth. Subsection
(2)  of section 16  provides:

16. (2) No case shall be decided upon such evidence alone,
and such evidence must be corroborated by some other material evidence.

This statutory provision in section 16(2)  and that in
section 301(2)  requiring corroboration of the evidence of the complainant, as
well as the rule of practice requiring corroboration of the evidence of an
accomplice, are all based upon the experience that long ago established the
danger of accepting the evidence of any of these parties unless it be
corroborated. The essentials of corroboration were considered in Rex v. Baskerville
3,
where at p. 667 it is stated :

We hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent
testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him
with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that
is, which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the
crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner committed it. The test
applicable to determine the nature and extent of the corroboration is thus the
same whether the case falls within the rule of practice at common law or within
that class of offences for which corroboration is required by statute.

See also Hubin v. The King 4.

It is unnecessary to here consider the difference in the
language of section 16(2)  and sections 301(2)  and 1002 , as well as 1003, in
which there is the identical provision for the reception of the evidence of a
child of tender years, more than to observe that it has been held that the
language of these sections should be construed to the same effect: Rex v.
Silverstone 5. The rule of practice with respect to
accomplices was stated in Rex v. Noakes 6, and has been
consistently approved and followed. It has been repeatedly held that the
unsworn evidence of a child of tender years will not constitute corroboration
of the evidence of another child of tender years whose evidence

[Page 352]

is also given without oath. Rex v. Whistnant 7
; Rex v. McInulty 8; Rex v. Lamond 9;
Brule v. Regem 10; Rez v. Drew 11, 12;
Rex; v. Manser 13.

In Great Britain, where the statutory provisions, (1908— 8
Edw. VII, c. 67, sec. 30(a), as amended 1914—4 & 5 Geo. V, c. 58, sec. 28
(2)), are similar to section 1003 (2), the unsworn evidence of a child of
tender years if not corroborated is entirely disregarded. As stated by Lord
Chief Justice Isaacs:

… it ought to be pointed out to the jury that they must not
act on the evidence of the child alone, but that there must be corroboration of
it before they are entitled to regard the child's evidence at all. Rex v.
Murray, 14.

And as stated by Lord Chief Justice Hewart :

In truth and in fact the evidence of the girl Doris ought to
have been obliterated altogether from the case, inasmuch as it was not
corroborated. Rex v. Manser 15.

Any suggestion that the corroboration of the brother might
be found in that of the complainant was referred to as ""mutual
corroboration"" and rejected in Rex v. Manser 16.
The evidence of each of these parties is possessed of the same inherent danger.
The purpose of corroboration is to remove that danger and this cannot be
accomplished by evidence which itself cannot alone be acted upon because it is
subject to the same danger and objection.

In this case section 301(2)  requires that the evidence of
the complainant must be corroborated ""by evidence implicating the
accused."" This provision in section 301(2)  is identical with that of
section 1002  as applied to section 301 , where:

The corroboration must be by evidence independent of the
complainant; and it ""must tend to show that the accused committed the
crime charged.""

Hubin v. The King 18.

Such independent evidence must possess probative value,
which is the very quality section 16  denies to the unsworn and uncorroborated
evidence of a child of tender years. Such is the effect of the specific
provision that ""such evidence must be corroborated."" It follows that
if it is not corroborated it does not possess probative value and

[Page 353]

should be ignored. The decision in Rex v. Hamlin 19
fails to give effect to this express provision and does not appear to be in
accord with the principles underlying the authorities already mentioned.

The Magistrate, in so far as he adopted the statement of the
law contained in that decision, misdirected himself and therefore the case
should go back for a new trial.

In view of the fact that this case is to be retried, it may
not be inappropriate to draw attention to the fact that the record discloses
that when Willie Gauvin was called as a witness his evidence was accepted as a
matter of course without oath. It does appear that counsel for the Crown at the
outset of his examination elicited that he was thirteen years of age, attended
school, knew he should not tell a lie in Court and if he did he would be
punished, but he did not know what it was ""to swear to something.""
The record however does not disclose that the Magistrate made either one of the
two findings required by section 16 . The procedure followed was not in accord with
the requirement of that section, as explained in Sankey v. The King 20
where at p. 439 Anglin, C.J., writing the judgment of the Court, stated:

Now it is quite as much the duty of the presiding judge to
ascertain by appropriate methods whether or not a child offered as a witness
does, or does not, understand the nature of an oath, as it is to satisfy
himself of the intelligence of such child and his appreciation of the duty of
speaking the truth. On both points alike he is required by the statute to form
an opinion; as to both he is entrusted with discretion, to be exercised
judicially and upon reasonable grounds. The term ""child of tender
years"" is not defined. Of no ordinary child over seven years of age can it
be safely predicated, from his mere appearance, that he does not understand the
nature of an oath.

Some of the learned Judges in the Court of Appeal found the
necessary corroboration in the evidence of Mayor Cousins, who deposed as to a
conversation at his home with the accused when he came there the same day the
child was born. It contains statements made by the accused from which,
depending largely upon the conduct and attitude at the time he made same,
certain inferences might be drawn therefrom, but that is a matter more
particularly for a trial Judge who has an opportunity of hearing the evidence. The
Magistrate, however, having

[Page 354]

directed himself as already indicated, did not find it
necessary to consider or make any finding based on the evidence of Mayor
Cousins.

The position is therefore similar to that in Hubin v.
The King 21, where Anglin, C.J., at p. 450 states:

Unfortunately, however, the trial judge appears not to have
considered this evidence or passed upon its sufficiency … There is no finding
by the trial judge as to the inference to be drawn from the conduct of the
accused, already adverted to, nor any adjudication that it affords the
requisite corroboration. We cannot, without usurping the exclusive function of
the tribunal of fact, make such an adjudication.

The conviction should be set aside and a new trial directed.

Rand J.—The
accused appeals from his conviction under section 301(2)  of the Criminal
Code . By that section

no person accused … shall be convicted upon the evidence of
one witness, unless such witness is corroborated in some material particular by
evidence implicating the accused.

The evidence for the prosecution was given by the girl
against whom the offence was charged to have been committed. Her testimony was
followed by that of a young brother admitted under section 16  of the Canada
Evidence Act . No further evidence of the circumstances of the offence was
presented.

Subsection (2) of section 16  provides that ""no case
shall be decided upon such evidence alone, and such evidence must be
corroborated by some other material evidence."" The trial Judge, treating
the unsworn evidence of the brother as corroboration of that of the
prosecutrix, convicted the accused, and on appeal and on the same ground the
conviction was affirmed with Létourneau, C.J. and Casey,
J. dissenting 22. There was other evidence given by the
mother of the prosecutrix and the mayor of the village which together might
have been found to furnish corroboration, but the trial Judge did not deal with
it.

The first question is, therefore, whether the corroboration
required by section 301  is furnished by the unsworn testimony alone of a
witness admitted under section 16 . Before the enactment of that section, the
only evidence admissible was that given under the sanction of an oath or its
equivalent. The introduction of an unsworn state-

[Page 355]

ment must then be
taken with the conditions annexed to it before it can be looked upon as
evidence in the full sense of the term. When under section 301(2)  corroboration
is required by ""evidence"" the word is used in that sense and it calls
for testimony possessing the essential sanction.

Under section 16 the statement as a condition of its
completeness requires like corroboration which means corroboration by evidence
satisfying the basic requirement. In the present case that subsidiary
corroboration is discovered in the evidence of the prosecutrix itself; but the
fallacy involved is perfectly obvious; it would mean that the evidence of the
prosecutrix which must be corroborated by testimony formally complete can
itself be used to corroborate imperfect testimony necessary to its own
corroboration: that it can be used, in other words, to corroborate its own
corroboration. That circular treatment is dealt with specifically in The
King v. Manser 23, where the Lord Chief Justice examines
""mutual corroboration"", as it has apparently been called, and in
rejecting it he expresses the view that ""in truth and in fact the evidence
of the girl Doris ought to have been obliterated altogether from the case,
inasmuch as it was not corroborated. It clearly was not corroborated by the
evidence of the girl Barbara (the prosecutrix).""

The question was considered in Rex v. Cowpersmith 24,
where Smith, J.A., observing that he was not overlooking Rex v. Manser
25 says:—

I think the Court there treated the evidence of the
complainant in all respects as if it had been unsworn evidence and would appear
to have drawn no distinction between the evidentiary value of sworn evidence
corroborated by unsworn evidence and that of unsworn evidence corroborated by
unsworn evidence.

That judgment followed Rex v. Hamlin 26
in which the Supreme Court of Alberta came to the like conclusion. The
reasoning in both of these decisions does not, in my opinion, pay sufficient
regard to the specific requirement, under section 301 (2) , of corroboration by
evidence carrying the necessary ritualistic obligation. If section 16, in
creating a new mode by which evidentiary matter could be introduced into a
trial, had intended the statement so presented to be sufficient for corroborative
purposes without

[Page 356]

its own corroboration, it must, I think, have declared so; I
can see no intention of Parliament to stamp the unsworn statement as sanctioned
evidence per se and then to require its corroboration for
a certain use only, leaving all other use at large. If the statement is
competent to corroborate so as to satisfy section 301(2) , how can it logically
be rejected for the same purpose under section 16? What difference in
implication as to the quality of the corroborative evidence can be found
between them? And yet the courts have uniformly held that such statements
cannot support each other: Rex v. Whistnant 27; Rex
v. Lamond 28; Rex v. Drew 29.
The two sections must be so read as to render the statement admissible as
corroboration only upon the independent performance of the condition annexed to
it.

The remaining question arises from the failure of the trial
Judge to deal with other evidence which might have furnished the basis of
corroboration. I find that in Hubin v. The King 30, this
Court had before it a similar situation, and it was decided that as no finding
had been made by the trial Judge as to the ""inference to be drawn from the
conduct of the accused … nor any adjudication that it affords the requisite
corroboration"" this Court could not, without usurping the exclusive
function of the tribunal of fact, make such an adjudication.

The conviction, therefore, should be set aside and a new
trial directed.

Appeal allowed, conviction set aside and new trial
directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Theft—Goods valued at less than $25—Summary
conviction—Deputy Recorder—Jurisdiction—Magistrate—Cities and Towns Act of
Quebec, c. 233 R.S.Q. 1941, sections 647, 648—Summary Convictions Act of Quebec,
c. 25 R.S.Q. 1941, section 6—Criminal Code , section 771  (a) (i).

The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of theft of goods
valued at $19 laid under Part XVI of the Criminal Code  and was sentenced to six
months imprisonment by the Deputy Recorder of the City of West-mount, Quebec.
It was argued in appeal that the Deputy Recorder had exceeded his jurisdiction
as he was not a magistrate within the meaning of section 771  (a) (i) of
the Criminal Code . The Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirmed the conviction.

Held: The Deputy Recorder having been clothed with the
jurisdiction of two justices of the peace by the provisions of the Summary
Convictions Act of Quebec, was within the definition of ""other
functionary"" in section 771  (a) (i).

[Page 370]

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's
Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming (Pratte J.A. dissenting) the
conviction of the appellant by the Deputy Recorder of Westmount, Quebec, on a
charge of theft of an object valued at less than $25.

The material facts of the case and the questions at
issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.

J. A. Budyk, K.C. for the appellant.

Rene T. Hebert, K.C.
for the respondent.

The Chief Justice: The appeal should be
dismissed.

The judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau, J.—The appellant was charged with the theft of
an object of 2 value of less than $25. He elected a summary trial under the
provisions of Part XVI of the Criminal Code , and after having pleaded guilty
was sentenced to six months imprisonment by Mr. A. E. Laverty, Deputy Recorder
of the City of Westmount.

The Court of King's Bench 2, Mr. Justice Pratte
dissenting, confirmed the conviction, and the appellant now appeals to this
Court.

Section 771  of the Criminal Code  says:—

(a) ""magistrate"" means and includes,

(i) in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and
Manitoba, any recorder, judge of a county court if a justice of the
peace, commissioner of police, judge of the sessions of the peace, and police
magistrate, district magistrate, or other functionary or tribunal, invested
by the proper legislative authority with power to do alone such acts as are
usually required to be done by two or more justices, and acting within the
local limits of his or of its jurisdiction.

It is argued that Mr. Laverty, being a deputy recorder, is
not a magistrate within the meaning of this section and that, therefore, he
exceeded his jurisdiction when he sentenced the appellant.

Under the Cities and Towns Act, chap. 233, R.S.Q.
(1941), section 647, the recorder may appoint under his hand a deputy recorder,
who must be an advocate of five years standing, and, the person so appointed,
says section 648,

[Page 371]

shall possess, for and during the time limited in the instrument
containing his appointment, or, if no time be therein limited, then from the
date of the registration as aforesaid, until the revocation thereof, the
jurisdiction, and be vested with all the rights, powers and privileges, and
shall discharge all the duties of the Recorder, to the exclusion, for the time
being, of the person so nominating him.

Mr. Laverty was duly appointed ""deputy recorder""
by the recorder of the City of Westmount, and he was therefore invested with
all the powers of the recorder himself. But it is argued, that section 771  Cr.
C. gives power only to a ""recorder"" to hear cases under Part XVI,
that the ""recorder"" is a ""persona designata"" by the Code,
and that therefore a ""deputy recorder"" although invested with the
same powers by the provincial authority, is not a ""magistrate""
included in paragraph (1) of section 771 .

I find it quite unnecessary to determine this point for the
reason that Mr. Laverty being a ""deputy recorder"", has the
jurisdiction of two justices of the peace. Section 6 of The Summary
Convictions Act of the Province of Quebec, chap. 25, R.S.Q. (1941) reads as
follows:

Any Judge of the Sessions of the Peace, Police Magistrate,
District Magistrate or Recorder, appointed for any territorial division,
and any Magistrate authorized to perform acts usually required to be done by
two or more Justices of the Peace, may do alone whatever is authorized by an
act of this Province to be done by any two or more Justices of the Peace.

Mr. Laverty having the same powers as the recorder himself
is a person, as section 771  says, ""invested by the proper legislative
authority with power to do alone such acts as are usually required to be done
by two or more justices"". He was, therefore, competent to convict the
appellant as he did.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by

Rand J.—The
appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of theft of goods valued at $19 laid under
Part XVI of the Code before the Deputy Recorder of the City of West-mount,
Quebec and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. An appeal was taken on
the ground that the Deputy was without jurisdiction under that Part but the
Court 2, Pratte, J. dissenting, interpreted the
words ""any

[Page 372]

Recorder"" in section 771  (a) (i) defining
the word ""Magistrate"", to include a Deputy Recorder, and rejected the
appeal.

Section 771  (a) (i) in addition to ""any
Recorder"", designates as Magistrate, ""any other functionary or
tribunal, invested by the proper legislative authority with power to do alone
such acts as are usually required to be done by two or more Justices""; and
as I find the Deputy Recorder in this case to be such an ""other
functionary"", it is unnecessary to examine the ground on which the Court
of Appeal proceeded.

The charter of Westmount incorporates the provisions of the Cities
and Towns Act, chap. 233, R.S.Q. (1941) dealing with a Recorder's Court,
sec. 648 of which defines the powers of the Deputy Recorder :—

648. The person so appointed shall possess, for and during
the time limited in the instrument containing his appointment, or, if no time
be therein limited, then from the date of the registration as aforesaid, until
the revocation thereof, the jurisdiction, and be vested with all the rights,
powers and privileges, and shall discharge all the duties of the Recorder, to
the exclusion, for the time being, of the person so nominating him.

The Summary Convictions Act of the Province, chap.
25, R.S.Q. (1941) by sec. 6 enacts:—

Any Judge of the Sessions of the Peace, Police Magistrate,
District Magistrate or Recorder, appointed for any territorial division, and
any Magistrate authorized to perform acts usually required to be done by two or
more Justices of the Peace, may do alone whatever is authorized by an act of
this Province to be done by any two or more Justices of the Peace.

And the expression ""territorial division"" is
defined to include a city.

From the foregoing, it is clear that the powers of the
Recorder embrace that scope of authority aimed at in section 771  (a) (i),
and with these, in turn, the Deputy Recorder has been clothed; the latter
is, therefore, such a functionary as is described in the paragraph and is
invested with the jurisdiction of a magistrate for the purposes of Part XVI.

The appeal must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA

Criminal law—Murder—Withdrawal of accused's counsel
because postponement refused—Appointment of another counsel by Court—Refusal of
Court to hear another counsel retained by accused's family—Illness of
juror—Discharge of jury—New jury containing some members of original
jury—Criminal Code  ss. 929 , 942 , 960 , 1014 (2) .

The accused was arrested and charged with murder on August 8,
1947, and within a few days retained the services of counsel W. After many
adjournments, the preliminary hearing started on October 8 and he was committed
for trial on October 21. On that same day he was brought up for arraignment.
His counsel W. moved to have the trial adjourned to the next assize and said that
he was contemplating an application for a change of venue. The presiding judge
refused the motion to traverse and set the date for the trial at November 10.
Counsel W. then withdrew from the case and the judge stated that he would
appoint someone if the accused did not appoint counsel within a day or two. The
following day, accused's sister addressed the Court in accused's presence and
asked for an adjournment, saying that they did not want W. to withdraw and that
they wanted their own counsel and not one appointed by the Court. However the
presiding judge appointed R. as accused's chief counsel and postponed the trial
for a week beyond the date previously fixed; the arraignment was also postponed
to the day of trial. When the trial opened, R. appeared for accused but before
arraignment M., a counsel, addressed the Court, saying
""I am appearing on behalf of the accused, retained by his family"".
The trial judge informed M. that the Court had appointed counsel and refused to
hear M. as to the nature of the application which he proposed to make. On
arraignment, accused pleaded not guilty but when asked if he was ready for
trial answered ""No Sir"". Thereupon R. said that this was accused's
answer and not his and that he was prepared to go on.

During the trial, when the jury was recalled to the courtroom
after a trial within the trial, one member was found to be absent because of
illness. The jury was then discharged but instructed to remain on the panel,
and a new jury was drawn. Nine members of the new jury had been on the previous
jury, which had sat for two days. The trial judge admitted the evidence which
was the subject of the trial within the trial.

The majority of the Court of Appeal having affirmed the
conviction, appellant raised two grounds of appeal in this Court, (a)
that he was not permitted to make full answer and defence by counsel of his
choice and (b) that the jury was not properly constituted.

Held: that, by his conduct, the accused has ratified
the choice of counsel made by the Court.

[Page 140]

Even if the trial judge should not have declined to hear M.,
as it was shown that the proposed application was for a further postponement of
the trial, the accused suffered no prejudice and the incident taints in no way
the fairness of what has been done. There was no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.

Held: also, that when discharged, the jury cease to be
the jury in that case, their functions are terminated and consequently they
were free to act again in the new trial.

Rex v. Luparello 25 C.C.C. 24 approved.

Rex v. Chong Sam Bow (1925) 1 W.W.R. 240
overruled.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba 1 dismissing (Dysart and Adamson JJ.A.
dissenting) the appellant's appeal from his conviction, at trial before
Williams C.J. K.B. and a jury, on a charge of murder.

H. Walsh for the appellant.

O. M. M. Kay for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

Taschereat J.:
Michael Angelo Vescio, the appellant in the present case, was charged with the
murder of one George Robert Smith, and on the 25th day of November, 1947, was
found guilty by a jury at the City of Winnipeg, at the Fall Assizes. The
Honourable Chief Justice Williams imposed the death penalty.

The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for the
Province of Manitoba, and the appeal 2 was dismissed Dysart and Adamson, JJ.
dissenting.

The grounds of dissent in the judgments of Dysart and
Adamson, JJ. may be summed up in one general statement, that the accused was deprived
of his right to make a full answer and defence to the charge laid against him,
by counsel of his own choice, that there was consequently a mistrial of such a
fundamental nature, that section 1014(2)  of the Criminal Code  does not apply.

The first Notice of Appeal to this Court based on the above
dissenting judgments was served on the 27th of April, 1948, and was followed on
the 28th of May by a second Notice, pursuant to an order of the Honourable Mr.
Justice Rand, made under section 1025 of the Criminal

[Page 141]

Code. Leave to appeal to this Court was
granted on the ground that the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province
of Manitoba conflicts as to the constitution of the jury, with a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Rex v. Chong Sam Bow 4).

The information on which the accused was charged was laid on
the 7th day of August, 1947, the warrant was executed the next day, and the
preliminary hearing which commenced on the 8th of October came to an end on the
21st of the same month, on which date the accused was committed for trial.

The Fall Assizes of the Eastern Judicial District opened at
two P.M. on the same day with Mr. Justice Major presiding. Mr. C. W. Tupper
appeared for the Crown and immediately asked that Vescio be arraigned on the
indictment charging him with the murder of George Robert Smith. This
application was strenuously opposed by Mr. Harry Walsh who appeared for Vescio,
and who asked that the case be traversed to the next Assizes in February, on
the ground that he was not ready to proceed. The next day, on the 22nd of
October, Mr. Justice Major refused the application and set the date for trial
for the 10th of November. It is then that Mr. Walsh made the following
declaration:—

in which case I must withdraw from the defence. I would ask
in fairness to the accused that your Lordship should defer arraignment until he
has an opportunity to consult counsel.

After a brief argument between the Court and Mr. Walsh, Mr.
Justice Major said:—

I will give two days for decision in the matter. If I do not
hear anything by Thursday I will appoint counsel to represent him. I will
adjourn this until Thursday. I expect the Crown counsel to advise me what has
been done.

 On Thursday no counsel appeared for Vescio, but his sister
Mrs. Bernhardi who was in the audience, applied for an adjournment of three or
four months. She insisted that she did not want Mr. Walsh to withdraw; ""we
want to keep him"", said she. Mr. Justice Major adjourned the case until
the 17th of November and explained to Mrs. Bernhardi that in view of the fact
that Mr. Walsh had declined to continue to act, it was the duty of the Court to
appoint counsel for him.

[Page 142]

On Friday, the 24th of October, at the opening of the Court
Mr. Justice Major appointed Mr. Ross, K.C. as ""chief counsel"" to
defend the accused and the case stood adjourned until the 17th of November for
trial.

On that date the case came for trial before Chief Justice
Williams, Mr. 0. M. M. Kay appeared for the Crown and Mr.
J. L. Ross for the accused. It was then, that Mr. E. J. McMurray, K.C. who is
the senior partner of Mr. Walsh said at the opening of the Court: ""I may
say my Lord that I am appearing on behalf of the accused, retained by his
family"". The Chief Justice then said that he could not recognize Mr.
McMurray in that capacity, that a counsel had been appointed for the accused 3½
weeks before, that he was in Court and prepared to go on. Mr. McMurray offered
to tell the Court the nature of the application which he intended to make, but
the Chief Justice replied that he ""did not think it was advisable to do
so, because he regretfully declined to hear him"". Mr. McMurray
then-withdrew, the accused was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. The trial
lasted seven days and a verdict was given on the 24th of November.

It is the contention of the appellant that a gross and
substantial miscarriage of justice was occasioned to the accused and a mistrial
took place, when Major, J. denied the accused counsel of his own choice, thus
denying him his right to ""make full answer and defence by counsel learned
in the law"", and forced upon the accused counsel whom he was not willing
to accept and through whom he did not wish to speak. It is also submitted that
the refusal of the learned trial judge to hear Mr. McMurray, was a refusal of
the accused of counsel of his own choice or of additional counsel to Mr. J. L.
Ross.

It is a fundamental principle of our criminal law that the
choice of counsel is the choice of the accused himself, that no person charged
with a criminal offence can have counsel forced upon him against his will, and
that it is the paramount right of the accused to make his own case to the jury
if he so wishes, instead of having it made for him by counsel (Rex v. Woodward
5).
Mr. Kay acting for the respondent did not challenge this, but submitted that in
the present case the appellant accepted Mr. Ross as his counsel. With this
proposition I agree.

[Page 143]

The appellant had selected Mr. Walsh as his counsel, but
unfortunately Mr. Walsh withdrew leaving the appellant without counsel. It
might have been advisable for the learned trial judge to ask the appellant if
he desired a counsel, or if he wished to defend himself, and thus the situation
would have been made clearer; but I do not think that under the circumstances,
the failure to ask this preliminary question had the effect of vitiating the
whole trial, as suggested by the appellant. By his conduct the accused has
ratified the choice which he now says has been forced upon him.

Immediately after the withdrawal of Mr. Walsh, Mr. Justice
Major adjourned the arraignment to allow the accused to appoint a new counsel.
When the Court resumed on the 24th, Mrs. Bernhardi who was present, objected to
the voluntary withdrawal of Mr. Walsh, but the accused remained silent. Mr.
Ross cross-examined the witnesses, addressed the jury, was in Court during six
days, and during 3½ weeks had the opportunity of conferring with the appellant,
and we cannot of course assume that he did not. During all these proceedings not
a word was said by the appellant that can lead us to believe that he even ever
thought of repudiating the choice made by the Court. It is then that the
accused should have done so, if he had any idea of conducting his own case or
of selecting a new counsel, and not now. In dealing with this matter I have
kept in mind the case of Reg. v. Yscuado 6 but with
due deference, I do not agree with all the statements made by Erle, J. as to
the inferences which may be drawn from the silence of an accused when the Court
requests a member of the Bar to give his services to a prisoner.

The conduct of the accused is to my mind a sufficient
sanction of what has been done, and is a bar to his tardy claims of unfair
trial and miscarriage of justice.

As to the refusal of the learned trial judge to hear Mr.
McMurray on the date of the opening of the trial, I would like to make the
following observations. For 3½ weeks, Mr. Ross had been acting as counsel for
Vescio, and on the 17th of November, he appeared on his behalf and was ready to
proceed. There had already been three different applica-

[Page 144]

tions made to traverse the case to the Winter Assizes which
had all been refused, and it is now clearly established by the Crown and
uncontradicted by the appellant, that when Mr. McMurray appeared in Court,
""retained by the family"", ' he wished to make a new application to
postpone the case, and we know that this application would have been refused.
It has also been made clear that neither Mr. McMurray nor Mr. Walsh intended to
proceed with the case and defend the accused. Vescio suffered therefore no
prejudice, and this incident taints in no way the fairness of the trial that
has been held.

There now remains the last question concerning the
constitution of the jury. After eighteen Crown witnesses had given their
evidence, ""a trial within the trial"" was held to determine the
admissibility of certain statements made by the accused to Port Arthur Police
Officers, in Port Arthur and Fort William. During these proceedings the petit
jury was excluded, and the Chief Justice reserved his judgment on the
admissibility of this evidence until the 19th of November. On that morning the
petit jury was recalled and only eleven jurymen took their places in the box,
one of them having been taken to hospital during the night. The Chief Justice
then discharged the balance of the petit jury, the jury panel was brought back
into the Court, and the cards of the petit jury placed back in the jury box. A
new petit jury was empanelled and when sworn it comprised nine former petit
jurors and three new members. It is submitted by the accused that this new jury
was improperly constituted and that a mistrial and a miscarriage of justice
occurred, when nine of these jurors who had been sworn and empanelled on November
17th, and who had heard evidence on November 17th and 18th and were discharged
on November 19th, were permitted to be sworn and empanelled on the new jury on
November 19th. The law on this point is quite clear. Section 929  of the
Criminal Code  states:—

The twelve men, or in the Province of Alberta the six men,
who in manner aforesaid are ultimately drawn and sworn shall be the jury-to try
the issues of the indictment, and the names of the men so drawn and sworn shall
be kept apart by themselves until such jury give in their verdict or until they
are discharged; and then the names shall be returned to the box there to be
kept with the other names remaining at that time undrawn and so loties
quoties as long as any issue remains to be tried.

[Page 145]

Section 945  of the Criminal Code  provides:—

The trial shall proceed continuously subject to the power of
the court to adjourn it.

2. The court may adjourn the trial from day to day, and if
in its opinion the ends of justice so require, to any other day in the same
sittings.

3. Upon every adjournment of a trial under this section, or
under any other section, the court may, if it thinks fit, direct that during
the adjournment the jury shall be kept together, and proper provision made for
preventing the jury from holding communication with any one on the subject of
the trial.

4. Such direction shall be given in all cases in. which the
accused may upon conviction be sentenced to death.

5. In other oases, if no such direction is given, the jury
shall be permitted to separate.

6. No formal adjournment of the court shall hereafter be
required, and no entry thereof in the Crown book shall be necessary. R.S., c.
146, s. 945.

I fail to see that the law as it then was, has not been
strictly complied with in the present proceedings. In a murder case, the jury
must be kept together as long as the trial lasts, and as it is stated
""upon every adjournment"", but when they are discharged, as they have
been in the present case, the application of the law comes to an end. They cease
to be the jury in that case and their functions are terminated, pursuant
to section 929  already cited. The jurors after having been discharged were
consequently free to act again in the new trial, and if the accused thought
that one or many of them, on account of what they have heard or seen,
""were not indifferent between the King and the accused"", he could
challenge him or them ""for cause"" pursuant to section 935  of the
Criminal Code . It was also his right to challenge peremptorily twenty jurors,
but as the record shows, he used only eighteen of these challenges. I agree
with what has been said on this point by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 7
and also with the judgment of the same Court rendered in 1925 in Rex v. Luparello
8
which has been followed.

The British Columbia case of Rex v. Chong Sam Bow
9
conflicts with the Luparello case 10 and it is overruled. It
is useless to deal with the case of Rex v. Wong O Sang 11
because there, the procedure was governed by section 960  of the Criminal Code ,
which is not the case here.

On the whole, the appeal fails and should be dismissed.

[Page 146]

The judgment of Kerwin, Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered
by

Rand J.: Two
grounds are taken in this appeal and I will deal with that of the constitution
of the jury first. The contention is this: that where, in a capital case, after
part of the evidence has been offered, the jury, because of the illness of a
juror, is discharged, the second panel must not include any member of the
first. It is put on two considerations: one, that the purpose underlying
section 945, which provides against the separation of the jury in certain
circumstances, would be defeated; and the other that the effect on the minds of
the jurors made by the evidence given must be taken to be of the same
objectionable character as if they had heard the case in full, had disagreed
and been discharged, in which case section 960  directing a ""new"" jury
would in principle govern.

On the point there is a conflict of authority. In Rex v.
Chong Sam Bow 12, the Appeal Court of British Columbia
acted on the latter ground and following Rex v. Wong Sang 13,
held the jury defective. In Rex v. Luparello 14, the
contrary view was taken by the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, Richards, J. A.
dissenting, which in the case before us was followed. The point seems to have
been similarly dealt with in Rex v. Gaffin 15, by
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.

It is indisputable that at common law in such circumstances
the remaining members of the jury were competent to serve on the second jury: Rex
v. Edwards 16, in which before all of the judges
except Lawrence, J., (1812), the rule was assumed: and for the same point only,
Rex v. Lawrence 17. The analogy of a disagreement,
whatever may be the true interpretation of section 960 , therefore disappears.
The one, if not the primary, object of section 945 is to keep the jurors free
from being tampered with, but obviously that ends when they have ceased to be
jurors. No doubt it may be desirable also that their minds be clear of all
matter except what is laid before them in court; but the remaining members of
the array summoned are free to read and listen at large; and to concede the

[Page 147]

competency of the latter to the second panel and to deny it
to the remaining members of the first would be wholly illogical. And where, as
here, the discharge and the reconstitution of the jury
took place within a period of fifteen minutes, any substance in the point
vanishes.

The next ground is of some difficulty. I agree with the
dissenting judgments of Adamson, J.A. and Dysart, J.A. 18 that
the Chief Justice at trial should have heard Mr. McMurray. There seems to have
been an initial misconception both of the nature of the action of appointing
counsel for an accused and of the right of the accused thereafter in relation
to him. To speak through counsel is the privilege of the client, and such an
appointment is made in circumstances in which for various reasons the accused,
assuming him to be of sufficient understanding, though he desires the benefit of
counsel, is not in a position to obtain it; and in the interest of justice
counsel should and will be assigned for his assistance. The desire of the
accused if not expressly indicated can ordinarily be presumed, but if there is
any doubt about it, the court should inquire: Reg. v. Yscuado 19,
where Erle J. said at page 387: ""I do not think I have any authority to
assign counsel to a prisoner without his consent. I should be very glad if I
could do so but by allowing counsel to appear without any communication with
the prisoner and without his sanction, I might be authorizing a defence which
the prisoner himself would never have made and yet for which he must be
responsible."" And certainly there is no statutory rule that defence by
counsel is a necessary part of the machinery of trial. In fact the contrary
appears from what is contemplated by section 944(2)  of the Criminal Code  where
it uses the language ""… or the accused, if he is not defended by counsel,
shall be allowed.""

Here, the accused, before Major, J., was represented by
counsel who had already conducted on his behalf the preliminary inquiry. There
was nothing so far to indicate any obstacle to his defence in the ordinary way.
But immediately on the withdrawal of Mr. Walsh—because of the refusal of his
motion to traverse the trial to the next sittings —Major, J., without reference
to the accused, intimated his duty and intention, should Mr. Walsh persist in
his

[Page 148]

withdrawal, to appoint counsel. Surely in that situation
nothing could be clearer than that the wishes of the accused should have been
consulted.

Then, when the arraignment was moved, Mr. Walsh's partner,
Mr. McMurray, K.C. rose, stating that ""he was appearing for the accused,
having been retained by the family."" The Chief Justice answered that he
could not hear him because counsel had already been appointed by the court.
That I cannot but think was both unfortunate and erroneous. The appearance of
Mr. McMurray was an unmistakable intimation that for some purpose at least he
had been retained by the accused and that so far Mr. Ross, K.C., who had been
appointed ""senior"" counsel had not been accepted as sole counsel. If
Mr. McMurray under his retainer, which I accept as having been made with the
consent and approval of the accused, had intended to proceed for all purposes
of the defence, I should have had great difficulty in finding that the refusal
to hear him had not vitiated all the subsequent proceedings. It is argued that
we must infer a general retainer to defend and that we cannot for any purpose
go behind the language ""I appear for the accused""; but with such a
plea as that the latter was deprived of his right to make full defence, we must
deal with the realities of what took place and not merely with the formality of
the external circumstances: we are therefore entitled to inquire into the
extent of the retainer, and into the intention of Mr. McMurray.

We have the undisputed statement of Mr. Kay that Mr.
McMurray stated to him immediately before he rose that he was making a motion to
traverse the trial, and that if he were not successful, Mr. Walsh would not act
with Mr. Ross. Mr. Kay states further, and again without challenge, that
nothing indicated in the slightest degree that Mr. McMurray would himself in
any circumstances have gone on with the defence; and Mr. Walsh very frankly in
the course of his able argument placed himself on the bare formal fact of the
refusal to hear Mr. McMurray, regardless of the nature of the motion Mr.
McMurray intended to make or of his intention in case of an adverse decision or
of the extent or purpose of his retainer. Mr. McMurray's appearance, therefore,
appears to have been in fact, as the Chief Justice says he understood it, to
make the motion

[Page 149]

for postponement and that only. But even if the facts do not
compel us so to interpret his intervention, there can be no doubt whatever that
his participation in the proceedings would have ended with the motion, if it
had been refused. If this were not so, we would have the assurance of another intention
on Mr. McMurray's part.

We know likewise, beyond any doubt, that a motion for
traverse would in fact have been refused. It had been denied by Major, J. at
the opening of the sittings: immediately after the abortive trial and when the
circumstances were most favourable, on the application of Mr. Ross, it had been
rejected by the Chief Justice; and we have both the statement of the latter
made immediately afterwards, that ""this case is going on"", and in his
report, that he should have refused the motion had it been made by Mr.
McMurray.

Now, in these circumstances, what appears externally as an
error of cardinal importance, is seen to be in reality of an entirely different
character; and it must be taken as beyond doubt that upon the conclusion of the
motion, the accused would have been in precisely the same position as when Mr.
Walsh withdrew. No suggestion has been made either that other counsel would
have been engaged or that the accused, aged twenty-one years, would have
defended himself; and although the ruling of the Chief Justice was no doubt a
coercive circumstance on the mind of the accused, yet in fact it played no part
in denying him the assistance of counsel of his choice. The contention is that
the trial in fact was what it was because of the refusal to hear Mr. McMurray.
The circumstances show conclusively that that was not so; the circumstances of
the trial would have been precisely the same had the motion been heard; and the
effective cause of the trial as it was carried out was the voluntary withdrawal
of counsel chosen by the accused. There was no suggestion either of any failure
or inability in confidential co-operation between the accused and Mr. Ross, an
experienced counsel, and no intimation of any sort before the Chief Justice at
any time during the trial that he was unwanted.

As against this error, there are in the case unchallengeable
facts so convincing and conclusive that it would seem a mockery of the
practical administration of justice to require

[Page 150]

their repetition in a new trial. Notwithstanding that,
however, had the actualities not been as indubitably they were, the vital
importance of administering the criminal law not only according to the
procedure laid down by law, but so that it would not only be but appear to
be in accordance with our basic conceptions of justice, would have
compelled me to conclude that that repetition must be made. But the facts,
properly understood, satisfy that fundamental obligation.

I should add that no point is made connected with any ground
on which the withdrawal of Mr. Walsh was based. In fact all grounds mentioned
in the Notice of Appeal— and there were twenty-nine of them—other than those
against the charge dealing with accident, drunkenness and provocation and as to
intent, and those with which I have dealt, were abandoned in the court below.
The appeal must therefore be dismissed.

Locke J.:—The
facts in connection with the withdrawal of Mr. Walsh, the appointment of Mr.
Ross, K.C. and of the appearance of Mr. McMurray, K.C. before the Chief Justice
at the opening of the Assizes, have been stated in the dissenting judgments in
the Court of Appeal. There are, in my opinion, some additional facts to be
considered in deciding the issues raised on this appeal.

The appellant, a convict serving a sentence for robbery in
the Stony Mountain Penitentiary, was taken in charge by the Police authorities
on the charge of murdering the boy George Robert Smith on August 8, 1947, and
within a few days thereafter retained Mr. Walsh to defend him. Mr. Walsh was
thus engaged on the matter for something more than two months before the
accused was brought before Major, J. on October 21st, and during that time had
represented the accused at the lengthy preliminary hearing during the course of
which the confession was admitted in evidence, and was thoroughly familiar with
the matter and had had ample time to make whatever preparations were necessary
for the defence. When the case was spoken to before Major, J. at the opening of
the Fall Assizes on October 21st, counsel for the prisoner asked that it be
traversed to the next Assizes on the ground that widespread publicity had been
given by the Winnipeg newspapers to

[Page 151]

the fact that the prisoner had made a confession and to a
statement made by the Chief of Police of Winnipeg that the bullet which had
killed the boy had been fired from a revolver found in the possession of the
accused, that counsel expected that the evidence of the ballistic expert called
at the preliminary by the Crown would be refuted by an expert on behalf of the
defence, and that he would require two or three months to prepare the defence.
Mr. Walsh then stated that unless the trial Judge adjourned the case until the
following January he would withdraw from the defence. The learned Judge's
decision on the motion for a traverse was given on the following morning
whereupon Mr. Walsh announced that he must withdraw from the defence and when
the trial Judge questioned his right to do so insisted that he had the right to
withdraw and proceeded to do so. I think it must be assumed that Mr. Walsh who
had been paid a retainer by the accused and apparently undertaken to defend him
withdrew with the consent of his client. In England the employment of a
barrister is a purely honourary one in the sense that it confers on him no
legal right to remuneration for his services but in Manitoba, by virtue of
section 72 of The Law Society Act, R.S.M. 1940, cap. 111, a barrister
may sue for his fees on the footing that an enforceable contract exists between
him and his client. On October 22nd when Mr. Walsh announced his withdrawal,
Major, J. stated that if the accused did not appoint counsel within a day or
two the Court would appoint someone and it was on the day following, when a
sister of the accused stated in Court that they did not want any other counsel
than Mr. Walsh, that he informed the accused that he had appointed Mr. Ross,
K.C. to act as counsel for him and on the following morning Mr. Ross appeared
and on behalf of the accused asked that the arraignment be deferred until the
17th of November, the day fixed by the presiding Judge for the commencement of
the trial. While the sister of the accused had said on October 23rd in the
presence of the prisoner that they did not want to have any other counsel but
Mr. Walsh, when the trial opened twenty-four days later Mr. Ross appeared and
stated that the defence was prepared to proceed. In the interval since his
appointment Mr. Ross had on the prisoner's behalf asked that he be examined by

[Page 152]

a psychiatrist to determine whether he was sane and this had
been done. Either on the evening of November 16th or the following morning
before Court Mr. McMurray informed Mr. Ross that he proposed to make an
application at the opening of the trial, and on that morning he also spoke to
counsel for the Crown in Court informing him that he had been retained by the
family of the accused and wished to make another application for a traverse of
the case to the next Assizes. According to Mr. Kay's statement he thereupon asked
Mr. McMurray if in the event of the application being refused he intended to
have his partner, Mr. Walsh, act with Mr. Ross as second counsel: the answer
was in the negative and Mr. Kay understood that neither Mr. McMurray nor Mr.
Walsh intended to take any part in the proceedings if the application was
refused. Nothing was said by the prisoner or by Mr. McMurray on his behalf to
the effect that he did not desire the services of Mr. Ross, of which he had
already availed himself, and during the ensuing trial which lasted seven days
Mr. Ross actively conducted the defence, apparently with the prisoner's
approval and consent.

The Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 20
stated twenty-six grounds of objection, these including a contention that a
miscarriage of justice occurred ""when counsel was appointed on my behalf
that I did not wish and whose services I did not desire and whose appointment I
did not sanction"", and further that ""I insisted that a witness should
be brought to my trial from Verdun, Que. but my desires were constantly
overridden by the said counsel appointed by the Court."" It was open to the
accused under section 27(3) of The Court of Appeal Act, R.S.M. 1940,
cap. 40, to have obtained the leave of the Court of Appeal to prove by affidavit
or otherwise the truth of the contention that he had not in fact accepted the
services of Mr. Ross, or to support his complaint as to the witness, but
nothing of this nature was done and the complaint against the manner in which
the defence had been conducted was abandoned in that Court 21.

It is of course fundamental that a person accused of a crime
is entitled to make full answer and defence either personally or by counsel of
his choice and that an accused

[Page 153]

may decline the services of counsel nominated by the Court.
While Mr. Justice Major had announced his intention of appointing counsel, I
have no doubt that the accused was made aware by Mr. Walsh, in whose presence
the announcement had been made on October 22nd, that this meant that the
services of a counsel nominated and paid by the Crown would be made available
to him and that he might reject the services of anyone so nominated. If he was
not then so advised I would assume that this information was given to him by
his family after they consulted Mr. McMurray, K.C. No doubt had the appellant
informed Mr. Ross1 that he did not desire his services the latter
would have withdrawn at once. Had the appellant so informed Mr. Ross I would
assume that the experienced counsel who represented him before the Court of
Appeal 22 would have obtained leave to prove
that fact by affidavit before that Court 23 and the fact that this
was not done indicates to me that nothing of the kind occurred. Apart from the
fact that, as shown by the trial judge's report, Mr. Ross acted for the
appellant in arranging that he be examined as to his sanity, to assume that he
stated to the Court that the defence was prepared to proceed when the trial
opened in the Assizes without having thoroughly discussed the matter with the
accused and made all proper preparations for the defence, would be to draw an
inference which I consider to be directly contrary to the fact. While the
prisoner when asked by the clerk whether he was ready for his trial said that
he was not, it was for his counsel, so long as he retained his services, to say
whether the defence was ready. The prisoner had apparently been a consenting
party to the withdrawal of Mr. Walsh some twenty-four days earlier after the
application to traverse the case to the next Assizes had been refused and the
answer made by him was apparently merely another attempt on his part to obtain
a further adjournment. Apart from the fact that Mr. Ross stated that the
defence was ready to proceed, an examination of the evidence makes it apparent
that ample time for preparation had been given. The prisoner had signed a
confession in which he admitted having accosted the boy on the street at night,
pointing a gun at him, forcing him into a back lane and shooting the

[Page 154]

child when he attempted to escape. The signed statement,
however, attributed the discharge of the gun to accident, claiming that the
accused had slipped on some clay in the lane when the boy attempted to get away
from him and pulled the trigger by mistake. Medical evidence given at the trial
showed that in addition to the fatal wound caused by the bullet which passed
through his body the boy had been struck a heavy blow on the head fracturing
his skull, the evidence indicating that this blow had been struck after the bullet
wound had been inflicted. The confession had been made voluntarily by the
accused and had been admitted in evidence at the preliminary hearing and it
must have been apparent to counsel for the accused that it would be admitted at
the trial. It is to be noted that while one of the grounds of appeal was that
evidence had been improperly admitted at the trial the point was not considered
worthy of argument in the Court of Appeal 24 and, when counsel for
the Crown stated at the commencement of his argument in that Court 25
that he understood this ground of appeal had been abandoned, there was no
dissent by counsel for the accused. In addition to this evidence a statement
made by the accused to his brother and sister while he was in custody in the
Winnipeg Police Station, to the effect that he had confessed and had done so
voluntarily, which had been overheard, was given in evidence both at the
preliminary and at the trial. While in view of the evidence afforded by the
confession and this statement it would appear the evidence was unnecessary, the
Crown called a ballistic expert, both at the preliminary hearing and at the
trial, who gave evidence that the bullet found in the ground near the boy's
body had been fired from a revolver found in the possession of the prisoner
when he was arrested in Port Arthur on the charge of robbery. It is apparent
that even if there were a ballistic expert who would have given evidence
contradicting this Crown witness it would have been pointless to call him. The
sanity of the prisoner had been enquired into at the instance of Mr. Ross and
he had been found sane. The crime had been committed at night and there were no
eye witnesses. In these circumstances it cannot, I think, be seriously
contended that twenty-four days was

[Page 155]

not ample time for counsel to prepare the defence. In my
opinion there can be no well founded criticism of the course followed by Mr.
Justice Major in making the services of Mr. Ross available to the prisoner and
in directing that the trial proceed twenty-four days after that date, or by
Chief Justice Williams in accepting the answer of Mr. Ross on November 17th
that the defence was ready and directing that the trial proceed.

When Mr. McMurray appeared at the opening of the trial he
stated that he was appearing ""on behalf of the accused, retained by his
family"" and asked to be permitted to state the nature of the application
he proposed to make. In the report made by the Chief Justice to the Court of
Appeal 26 he states that he did not understand
that Mr. McMurray was seeking to defend the prisoner and that he took from this
statement that counsel was appearing for the clients who had retained him and
not for the accused. I think it was unfortunate, assuming as I do that Mr.
McMurray had been retained to make the application by the accused, that he did
not make this clear to the learned trial Judge. Counsel may speak on behalf of
a prisoner only if authorized by him to do so but the retainer would be none
the less that of the prisoner if it had been made on his behalf by some member
of his family on his direction, which presumably was the case here. Had the
question been asked whether Mr. McMurray was authorized by the prisoner the
position would have been made perfectly clear and the only matter then to be
decided would be whether, in view of the fact that an application to traverse
the case had been made and dismissed by Major, J., the Chief Justice would
entertain another motion to be made apparently without filing any material to
support it. If Mr. McMurray had said that he proposed to undertake the defence
of the accused and either dispense with the services of Mr. Ross or to act with
him, he would no doubt have been heard. It has been made quite clear that the
only application which he proposed to make was that the case be traversed to
the next Assizes and that he did not intend to take any part in the defence if
the motion was refused and we are informed by the judge's report that any such
motion would have been refused. In my opinion, if

[Page 156 ]

it was error on the part of the learned Chief Justice in
declining to permit Mr. McMurray to make this motion, it has been shown
affirmatively by the Crown that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has actually occurred and the provisions of section 1014(2)  of the Criminal
Code  should be applied.

A further ground of appeal urged on behalf of the appellant
is that the jury was not properly constituted. As to this I agree with my
brother Rand.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL UNDER SECTION 1025 (1), (NEW) OF
THE CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA.

Criminal Law—Appeal—Jurisdiction—Statute giving new
right of appeal not retrospective—11–12 Geo. VI c. 39, s. 42, enacting s. 1025
(1)  Criminal Code .

By 11–12 Geo. VI, c. 39, s. 42, s. 1025 (1)  of the Criminal
Code  was repealed and the following substituted therefor: ""Either the
Attorney General or any person convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of any court of appeal setting
aside or affirming a conviction or verdict of acquittal in respect

[Page 90]

of an indictable offence, on any question of law, if leave to
appeal is granted by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one
days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced, or within such extended
time thereafter as the judge to whom the application is made may for special
reasons allow; in an appeal by the Attorney General the judge may impose such
terms, if any, as he may see fit.""

Held: that the enactment creates a new right of appeal,
where none existed before, on any question of law raised in the Court of
Appeal.

Held: also, that legislation conferring a new
jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal cannot be construed
retrospectively, so as to cover cases arising prior to such legislation, unless
there is something making unmistakeable the legislative intention that it
should be so construed. (Singer v. The King), [1932] S.C.R. 70,
approved and followed.

Semble: that if the new legislation does not apply to a
case which arose prior to its coming into force, the old legislation, by virtue
of s. 19 of the Interpretation Act, continues to apply.

MOTION by appellant before the Chief Justice of
Canada in Chambers, for leave to appeal to this Court under s. 1025 (1)  Criminal
Code , from the judgment rendered by the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side)
of the Province of Quebec on November 30, 1948 1, confirming the jury's
verdict rendered against him on December 6, 1947, by which he was found guilty
of the crime of conspiracy.

The motion was made under s. 1025(1)  of the Criminal
Code  (R.S.C. 1927, c. 36), as enacted by 11–12 Geo. VI c. 39, s. 42. By the
said amending Act, (s. 42), the following was substituted for s. 1025:

1025 (1) Either the Attorney-General or any person
convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
from the judgment of any court of appeal setting aside or affirming a
conviction or dismissing an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal
in respect of an indictable offence, on any question of law, if leave to appeal
is granted by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty-one days
after the judgment appealed from is pronounced, or within such extended time
thereafter as the judge to whom the application is made may for special reasons
allow; in an appeal by the Attorney General the judge may impose such terms, if
any, as he may see fit.

Lucien H. Gendron K.C. for the motion.

Philippe Brais K.C. contra.

The Chief Justice:—The
petitioner prays that permission be granted him to appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada from the judgment rendered by the Court of

[Page 91]

King's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec,
confirming the verdict rendered against him, by which he was found guilty of
the crime of conspiracy.

The petition is based exclusively on the new subsection one
of section 1025  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, which came into force on
the 1st of November, 1948.

The petitioner does not allege, nor was it a fact, that, in
the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), affirming his
conviction, there was any question of law on which there was dissent in the
Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) (Criminal Code , s. 1023 ). He
does not allege, either, that the judgment of the Count of King's Bench (Appeal
Side) conflicts with the judgment of any other Court of Appeal in a like case
(former ss. 1  of s. 1025  of the Criminal Code ). He relies
entirely and exclusively, as above mentioned, upon the new ss. 1 of s. 1025 ,
being Chap. 39, 11–12 George VI, s. 42, which has only acquired the force of
law since the 1st day of November, 1948.

The preliminary question which it is essential to consider
and to decide is, therefore, whether the petitioner, against whom the
information was laid long before this new amendment became effective—the jury's
verdict was rendered on the 6th of December, 1947 and judgment delivered
accordingly by the presiding judge; notice of appeal was dated the same day and
lodged in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) on December 9, 1947—may invoke,
in his favour, the new ss. 1 of s. 1025  in order to ask a judge of the Supreme
Court of Canada to grant him leave to appeal to that Court on the questions of
law debated and decided by the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side).

The judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) was
delivered on the 30th of November, 1948; and the contention of the petitioner
is that, since the judgment from which he wishes to appeal was posterior to the
coming into force of the new amendment, that is sufficient to enable him to
take advantage of the law.

The point to be decided is, therefore, one concerning the
jurisdiction of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada to grant leave in the
circumstances; and it is of great and general importance, because it stands, of
course, for the first time to be decided and will likely govern the applica-

[Page 92]

bility of that new section to all petitions for leave to
appeal which may come from all parts of the Dominion in the future, or at least
for as long as that section remains part of the Criminal Code .

The argument of the petitioner in support of his contention
is that, as the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) was
delivered after the new subsection became effective, the date of that judgment
is the material one to be considered for the purpose of deciding whether the
section is applicable or not.

It is said that the right of appeal accruing to the
petitioner, or to any convicted prisoner, was only eventual prior to the
judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), and that the right of
appeal which the petitioner now seeks to exercise only arose when that judgment
was rendered. It is contended the fact that a man committed an indictable
offence and was brought before the Courts did not vest a right in the Crown as
against him, nor vest in the accused person an immediate right of appeal either
to the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), or to the Supreme Court of Canada;
that the date of the commission of the offence cannot be the date upon which
the prisoner's rights should be decided, because, if that were so, as the
former ss. 1 of s. 1025  has been repealed by the new legislation and if the new
ss. 1 of s. 1025  does not apply to him, he would be deprived of any right of
appeal.

Of course, I do not agree that, if the new subsection one of
s. 1025  does not apply to the present petitioner in the circumstances of his
case, he is deprived of the right of appeal as was provided by the former ss. 1
of s. 1025 . It would seem to me in that case that s. 19(c) of the Interpretation
Act would come to his relief, and that, if the new legislation does not
apply to a case which arose prior to its coming into force, by force of s. 19
of the Interpretation Act the old legislation continues to apply to the
cases that are not governed by the new ss. 1 of s. 1025 .

Alternatively, the petitioner contends that the right to
apply for leave to appeal in virtue of the new subsection is not a new right,
because the right to apply existed under

[Page 93]

the repealed ss. 1 of the former s. 1025  in cases where
there was a conflict of authority, and that the new subsection merely changes
the procedure.

Further, when confronted with a number of decisions rendered
in civil cases, he sought to distinguish between those cases and informations
brought under the criminal code and asked that the rule in the civil
cases should not be applied.

There are, of course, a series of decisions in this Court,
dating back to almost the beginning of the time when the judicial functions of
the Court took effect and could be exercised, whereby this Court is without
jurisdiction when the judgment intended to be appealed from was signed, or
entered, or pronounced previous to the date when, by proclamation issued by
order of the Governor in Council, the right of appeal to this Court was brought
into being. Taylor v. The Queen 2, contains a long
exposition of the law as then interpreted by the full Court (Richards, C.J.C.,
Ritchie, Strong, Taschereau and Fournier, JJ.). All the members of the Court
gave reasons on the point now before me and they were unanimous in reaching the
conclusion that the provision of the law coming into force subsequent to the
date when the judgment sought to be appealed from had been signed, pronounced,
or entered, cannot be given a retrospective effect and operate in order to give
jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of Canada to hear an appeal from the judgment
so signed, pronounced, or entered prior to the date when the new law became
effective.

In 1891, in the case of Hurtubise v. Desmarteau 3,
again the Court was unanimous in denying the right of appeal in a case where
the judgment sought to be appealed from was delivered on the same day on which
the amending Act came into force. It was decided that the Court had no
jurisdiction, the appellant not having shown that the judgment was delivered
subsequent to the passing of the amending Act.

In 1893 in Williams v. Irvine 4, the
decision of the Court was that a new right of appeal did not extend to cases
standing for judgment in the Superior Court prior to the passing of the Act.
Fournier J. expressed the view that

[Page 94]

the statute was not applicable to cases already instituted,
or pending, before the Courts, where no special words to that effect had been
used in the statute. Taschereau J. merely stated that he would have been of the
opinion that the Court had jurisdiction, but he said that he would not take
part in the judgment. Sedgewick J. stated that in his opinion the appeal should
be dismissed upon the authority of the case of Couture v. Bouchard 5,
decided by this Court in December, 1892.

In Hyde v. Lindsay 6, the
Court decided that the Act 60 and 61 Victoria, chap. 34, which restricted the
right of appeal to the Supreme Court in oases from Ontario as therein
specified, did not apply to a case in which the action was pending when the Act
came into force, although the judgment directly appealed from may not have been
pronounced until afterwards. The judgment of the Court was delivered by
Taschereau J. who referred to Hurtubise v. Desmarteau, Couture v.
Bouchard and Williams v. Irvine supra; and to Cowen v.
Evans 7, Mills v. Limoges 8
and The Montreal Street Railway v. Carrière 9, where a
footnote at that page states that an appeal in an action for $5,000 damages was
dismissed by the Superior Court prior to the passing of 54 and 55 Victoria,
chap. 25, but maintained by the Court of Queen's Bench on the 26th of April,
1893, for $600, was also quashed for want of jurisdiction, following the case
of Cowen v. Evans (supra).

In Hyde v. Lindsay supra, Taschereau J. at p.
103, said:—

Here we have the question presented under a statute taking
away the right of appeal in cases where it existed previously. ***If the
statute in former cases does not apply to pending cases, I do not see upon what
principle we could hold that the statute in the present case does apply to
pending cases.

In 1914 in Doran v. Jewell 10 it was
held that an Act of Parliament enlarging the right of appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada did not apply to a case in which the action was instituted
before the Act came into force. In that case the motion was referred to the
Court by the registrar for an order to have the jurisdiction of the Court to
hear the appeal affirmed and it was unanimously dismissed on the ground that
the motion was concluded

[Page 95]

adversely to the appellant by the authority of the several
judgments previously delivered in this Court on the same point and also as a
result of the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the
case of Colonial Sugar Refining Co. v. Irvine 11. This
judgment of the Privy Council may be immediately referred to. The Judicial
Committee was composed of Lord Macnaghten, Lord Davey, Lord Robertson, Lord
Lindley, Sir Ford North and Sir Arthur Wilson. The judgment of their Lordships
was delivered by Lord Macnaghten and it was held that, although the right of
appeal from the Supreme Court of Queensland to His Majesty in Council, given by
the Order in Council of June 30, 1860, had been taken away by the Australian
Commonwealth Judiciary Act, 1903, s. 39, sub-s. 2, and the only appeal
therefrom now laid to the High Court of Australia, yet the Act was not
retrospective, and the right of appeal to the King in Council in a suit pending
when the Act was passed and decided by the Supreme Court afterwards was not
taken away. At p. 372 Lord Macnaghten said:—

As regards the general principles applicable to the case
there was no controversy. On the one hand, it was not disputed that if the
matter in question be a matter of procedure only, the petition is well founded.
On the other hand, if it be more than a matter of procedure, if it touches a
right in existence at the passing of the Act, it was conceded that, in
accordance with a long line of authorities extending from the time of Lord Coke
to the present day, the appellants would be entitled to succeed. The Judiciary
Act is not retrospective by express enactment or by necessary intendment. And
therefore the only question is: Was the appeal to His Majesty in Council a
right vested in the appellants at the date of the passing of the Act, or was it
a mere matter of procedure? It seems to their Lordships that the question does
not admit of doubt. To deprive a suitor in a pending action of an appeal to a
superior tribunal which belonged to him as of right is a very different thing
from regulating procedure. In principle, their Lordships see no difference
between abolishing an appeal altogether and transferring the appeal to a new
tribunal. In either case there is an interference with existing rights contrary
to the well-known general principle that statutes are not to be held to act
retrospectively unless a clear intention to that effect is manifested.

In 1920, in Upper Canada College v. Smith 12,
the Court had before it the statute 6 George V, c. 24, s. 19, amended by 8
George V, c. 20, s. 58, by which s. 13 of the Ontario Statute of Frauds, R.S.O.
1914, c. 102 was enacted as follows:—

No action shall be brought to charge any person for the
payment of commission or other remuneration for the sale of real property
unless

[Page 96]

the agreement upon which such action shall be brought shall
be in writing separate from the sale agreement and signed by the party to be
charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.

It was held that this enactment was not retrospective and
did not bar an action to recover commission under a contract made before it
came into force. The majority of the Court agreed with Anglin J., as he then
was, who, in his reasons, referred to a great number of authorities. Duff J.,
as he then was, at p. 417 recalled the well-known passage of Lord Coke (2 Inst.
292) in which it is laid down that it is a ""rule and law of Parliament
that regularly nova constitutio futuris formam imponere debet non
praeteritis"". And Mr. Justice Duff continued:—

and the rule that statutory enactments generally are to be
regarded as intended only to regulate the future conduct of persons is, as
Parke B. said in Moon v. Durden, in 1848 13,
""deeply founded in good sense and strict justice"", because speaking
generally it would not only be widely inconvenient but ""a flagrant
violation of natural justice"" to deprive people of rights acquired by
transactions perfectly valid and regular according to the law of the time.

At p. 419 of the same judgment Mr. Justice Duff said:—

And even more numerous instances might be adduced of dicta
enunciating the doctrine that the intention must appear from the words of the
statute itself. ""The principle is one of such obvious convenience and
justice that it must always be adhered to in the construction of statutes
unless in cases where there is something on the face of the enactment putting
it beyond doubt that the legislature meant it to operate retrospectively.""

Mr. Justice Duff referred to the Midland Rly. Co. v. Pye,
in 1861 14, where there is a passage in the
judgment of Erle C.J. approved by the Privy Council in Young v. Adams
15, at p. 476, in these words:—

Those whose duty it is to administer the laws very properly
guard against giving to an Act of Parliament a retrospective operation unless
the intention of the legislature that it should be so construed is expressed in
plain and unambiguous language; because it manifestly shocks one's sense of
justice that an act legal at the time of doing it should be made unlawful by
some new enactment.

Speaking on the point that the change in the Upper Canada
College case was only one of procedure, Mr. Justice Duff, at p. 423, said:—

The last mentioned rule (about procedure) rests upon the
simple and intelligible reason stated by Mellish L.J. in Republic of Costa
Rica v. Erlanger in 1876 16 at p. 69, in these words:—

[Page 97]

""No suitor has any vested interest in the course of
procedure, nor any right to complain if during the litigation the procedure is
changed provided, of course, that no injustice is done.""

Mr. Justice Duff then referred to the passage in the
judgment of Lord Macnaghten in Colonial Sugar Refining Co. v. Irving
supra above quoted.

At p. 429 of the same judgment Mr. Justice Duff refers to Moon
v. Durden and states that in that case Helmore v. Shuter 17,
was accepted expressly by three of the judges, Platt, Rolfe and Parke BB., as
being unquestionably a sound decision; and Rolfe and Parke BB. explicitly
treated it as an example of the application of the rule that prima facie
statutes are to be construed as prospective, which indeed is the ratio upon
which the decision was in terms put by the Court that pronounced it.

In Singer v. The King 18, the
Court held that: ""Legislation conferring a new jurisdiction on an
appellate court to entertain an appeal cannot be construed retrospectively, so
as to cover cases arising prior to such legislation, unless there is something
making unmistakeable the legislative intention that it should be so construed.
The matter is one of substance and of right."" Doran v. Jewell 19
and Upper Canada College v. Smith 20 were
relied upon. In the Singer case it was held that 21–22 George V, c. 28,
s. 15 (amending s. 1025  of the Criminal Code ) did not give a right to
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the sustaining of the appellant's
conviction by a judgment of the Appellate Division of Ontario rendered prior to
such legislation.

Singer had been convicted on the 23rd of March, 1931, and
his conviction was sustained by the Appellate Division on the 26th of June,
1931. The statute, in virtue of which Singer sought to appeal to this Court,
became law on the 1st of September, 1931. Anglin C.J.C., delivering the
judgment of the Court, at p. 72 stated:—

It is common ground that, unless there is something making
unmistakeable the intention of the Legislature that a retrospective
construction should be put upon the legislation so that it may cover cases
arising prior thereto, no clause, conferring a new jurisdiction an an appellate
court to entertain an appeal, can be so construed. The matter is one of
substance and of right.

[Page 98]

The decision in Doran v. Jewell 21
is binding upon us and is conclusive to that effect. If further authority be
required on this point, it may be found in Upper Canada College v. Smith
22.

I wish to underline the following words in this decision of
the Court:—

Unless there is something making unmistakeable the intention
of the Legislature that a retrospective construction should be put upon the
legislation so that it may cover cases arising prior thereto, no clause,
conferring a new jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal, can
be so construed. The matter is one of substance and of right.

This decision assumes an added importance from the fact that
the amendment there considered was one enacted to modify the same section 1025 
as is invoked in the present case, and the Court there said that legislation
conferring a new jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal
cannot be construed retrospectively so as to cover ""cases arising prior to
such legislation""—words which might refer either to the institution of the
case, or at least to the actual beginning of the trial in the original Court,
but surely not to the mere incident of the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

Further, the decision in Doran v. Jewell (a
civil case) is there stated to be ""binding upon us and is conclusive to
that effect""; and the decision in Upper Canada College v. Smith (another
civil case) is also stated as being ""a further authority on this
point"".

The question is not whether the case is civil or criminal.
No distinction is made in that respect in the jurisprudence. The question is
solely: What is the character of the legislation? If, in terms or by necessary
intendment, it is retrospective, then, of course, it produces retroactive
effects; but otherwise, it is prospective only and becomes applicable only for
the future.

It would appear from the judgment in the Singer case
that not only is legislation conferring a new jurisdiction upon an Appellate
Court to entertain an appeal—which is the very case that we have in the present
petition—not to be construed retrospectively so as to cover cases arising prior
to such legislation, but also, although the Singer case was a criminal
case, it was put exactly on the same footing

[Page 99]

in that respect as Doran v. Jewell and Upper
Canada College v. Smith, both civil cases which were declared
binding upon this Court and conclusive to that effect.

I cannot see any distinction that can be made between the Singer
case and the present one. It covers exactly the situation that we have as a
result of the petition which I now have before me; and I would say that it is a
fortiori binding upon this Court and conclusive, because, although the two
cases cited by Anglin C.J.C. were civil cases, the Singer case was not
only a criminal case but it came before this Court precisely on the application
of a new amendment to section 1025  of the Criminal Code , which was practically
to the same effect as the new subsection one of section 1025  which is now
invoked by the petitioner.

Further reference might be made to the judgment of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in Rex v. Rivet 23,
where it is stated:—

Legislation creating or abolishing a right of appeal does
not relate merely to procedure and will not be given a retrospective effect in
the absence of an apparent intention to the contrary. Therefore, sub-para. (k)
of para. (7) of s. 2  of the Criminal Code  (am. 1943, c. 23, s. 1 ), designating
a Court of Appeal in criminal matters for the Northwest Territories, is
ineffective to confer jurisdiction upon the Alberta Court of Appeal in respect
of appeals from convictions, made prior to the enactment of such legislation.

I might add that I do not agree with the contention of
Counsel for the petitioner that the new subsection one of section 1025  does not
create a new right of appeal. Up to the coming into force of that new
subsection, there existed only two rights of appeal in favour of the person
convicted, whose conviction had been affirmed by the Court of Appeal. One was
under section 1023 : ""On any question of law on which there has been
dissent in the Court of Appeal""; the other was under the former subsection
one of section 1025 : ""If the judgment appealed from conflicts with the
judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case"".

Under the new subsection one of section 1025  ""any
person convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada from the judgment of any court

[Page 100]

of appeal setting aside or affirming a conviction or
dismissing an appeal against a judgment or verdict of acquittal in respect of
an indictable offence, on any question of law"". The only requirement is
that leave to appeal must be granted by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada.

It is quite clear and evident that a new right of appeal is
created where none existed before; that is, while section 1023  was left as it
was, the new subsection one of section 1025 , now substituted for the former
one, has done away with the need of showing a conflict between two courts of
appeal and a new right of appeal is created ""on any question of law"".
It does not even require that there should be a dissent in the Court of Appeal,
nor that any of the judges who took part in the judgment in that Court should
have entertained the question of law upon which the convicted person may ask
for leave to appeal. It is now sufficient that the person convicted may have
raised a question of law in the Court of Appeal and, although every one of the
judges in that Court refused to accept that proposition of law as being sound,
the mere fact that the said question of law was raised by the convicted person
in the Court appealed from is sufficient to give him a ground upon which he may
ask a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada to grant leave to appeal on that
question to this Court.

For these reasons I am of opinion that the petitioner herein
cannot invoke the new subsection one of section 1025  in his case; that, as a
consequence, since he does not allege either dissent or conflict and as, in
fact, no dissent exists and no conflict has been shown, I am without
jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal in the present instance.

Having come to that conclusion, I have nothing to say about
the other questions raised by the petitioner.

The petition is dismissed.

Leave to appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Trial—Evidence—Trial, with jury, of actions
for damages caused by collision of motor cars—Questions by cross-examining
counsel to party as to convictions on previous occasions under Highway Traffic
Act—New trial—Right to jury.

The actions, tried together, with a jury,
were for damages caused by a collision between a motor car owned and driven by
appellant and one owned and driven by respondent S. The jury found negligence
in each driver contributing to the accident, and apportioned the fault, against
said respondent 75 per cent. and against appellant 25 per cent.; and,
accordingly, judgments were given for damages, to appellant against said
respondent, and to a passenger in the latter’s car, now also a respondent,
against appellant. On appeal by said respondents, the Court of Appeal for
Ontario ordered a new trial ([1945] 4 D.L.R. 450). That order was now affirmed
by this Court on the ground that, at the trial, appellant’s counsel, in
cross-examining the respondent driver (and following some explanatory remark by
the latter that it was his “first occasion in court”, and counsel indicating
intention to attack credibility) elicited from him that on certain charges of
speeding in previous years he had paid fines; but it was not established that
he had himself committed the offences (he might, as owner of a car driven by
others, have “incurred penalties” under The Highway Traffic Act, Ont.,
without having himself “violated” the Act; he stated that on none of the
occasions had he appeared in court); and, assuming evidence as to the
convictions was admissible at all, such evidence could only have been adduced
if counsel were in a position to show that the witness had himself committed
the offences; respondents had met the onus under s. 27(1) of The Judicature
Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 100 (of showing a “substantial wrong or miscarriage”).
But this Court held that the direction by the Court of Appeal that the new
trial should be without a jury should be set aside; as a jury is an eminently
proper tribunal for trial of the matters in issue, sufficient ground had not
been shown to deprive appellant, by said direction, of that right. (The Court
found it unnecessary to decide whether, in view of s. 55 of The Judicature
Act, and the authority thereby and by the Rules conferred upon the trial
judge, the direction could be supported.)

[Page 278]

APPEALS from judgments of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], which
set aside judgments of Barlow J. on the findings of a jury, and ordered a new
trial, to be had before a judge without a jury.

There were two actions, tried together before
Barlow J. with a jury. They arose out of a collision on February 12, 1944, on
Highway No. 2, near Highland Creek, Ontario, between a motor car owned and
driven by the appellant and one owned and driven by the respondent Secord. The
appellant sued Secord for damages for personal injuries and damage to her car,
and the respondent Nasmith, a passenger in Secord’s car, sued the appellant for
damages for personal injuries. The jury found negligence on the part of both
drivers causing or contributing to the cause of the accident, found the degrees
of such negligence to be: respondent Secord 75 per cent., and appellant 25 per
cent., and assessed appellant’s total damages at $3,000 and respondent
Nasmith’s total damages at $5,000. In accordance with such findings, judgment
was given in favour of the appellant for $2,250 against the respondent Secord
and judgment was given in favour of the respondent Nasmith for $1,250 against
the appellant. The said Secord and Nasmith appealed to the Court of Appeal for
Ontario, which gave judgments as above stated (Laidlaw J.A. dissented, except
that he would direct a new trial as between Nasmith and the present appellant,
but confined to the ascertainment of the quantum of damages sustained by
Nasmith). Appellant appealed to this Court.

D.L. McCarthy K.C. (in one appeal) and
J.R. Cartwright K.C. (in the other appeal) for the appellant.

F.J. Hughes K.C. for the respondent
Secord.

J.J. Robinette K.C. for the respondent
Nasmith.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

KELLOCK J.—These appeals are taken from orders
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated 6th July, 1945, which allowed appeals
by the respondents from judgments of Barlow J., dated 24th February, 1945,
entered pursuant to the verdict of a jury. The two actions arose out of a

[Page 279]

collision on 12th February, 1944, between
automobiles owned and driven by the appellant and the respondent Secord,
respectively, the appellant Nasmith being a passenger in the Secord car. The
actions were tried together. By the order in appeal a new trial was directed,
Laidlaw J.A. dissenting. The view of the majority was that the trial was
unsatisfactory by reason of conduct on the part of counsel representing the
appellant at the trial and also on the ground that a jury acting judicially and
with a proper appreciation of its duties must necessarily have arrived at a
greater amount of damages than was awarded Nasmith. The majority were also of
the view that the damages, in the absence of other explanation, might also be
the result of the conduct of counsel already referred to. Laidlaw J.A.
dissented on the ground that no sufficient or any objection had been made at
trial and that the present respondents had failed to show any substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice. While a new trial was directed, that trial was
directed to take place without a jury.

In our opinion, the appeal should be dismissed
but the direction that the new trial shall take place without a jury must be
deleted. We do not consider it necessary to deal with all the matters of which
the respondents complain with regard to the conduct of the trial. We think it
is sufficient to refer to one matter only which, in our opinion, makes it
necessary that a new trial should be had.

Immediately before commencing his
cross-examination of the respondent Secord, counsel for the appellant, in the
absence of the jury, said, basing himself upon the provisions of
section 18(1) of The Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1937, Chap. 119, that he
proposed to cross‑examine the witness with respect to previous convictions
under The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1937, Chap. 288. He said: “I
submit I have that right on purely a question of credibility; I am not
submitting it on any other ground, it is on the ground of credibility.” And
again: “I am not trying to put the convictions in as evidence to show he is a
bad driver on previous occasions or because he was convicted of speeding on
previous occasions that he was speeding on this occasion, I am submitting it on
credibility, * * *”

[Page 280]

Objection was made by counsel for both
respondents and at the conclusion of argument with regard to the point the
learned trial judge ruled as follows:

His Lordship: Mr. Levinter put his
application for leave to introduce by way of cross‑examination questions
as to previous convictions of the defendant Dr. Secord, on the ground that he
is entitled to cross-examine as to those by way of attacking the credibility of
the witness; well, that might be so from a certain standpoint, yet in an action
of this kind before a jury it would have a very different effect entirely, and
for that reason alone, regardless of any other reasons that there may be, I
must rule that the questions cannot be asked. If I am wrong and this goes
farther, it will have to be corrected elsewhere. Bring the jury back.

The cross-examination proceeded and in the
course of it the witness, in excusing himself for the way in which he had given
some answers on discovery, made the statement: “This is my first occasion in
court. I am not familiar with the proceeding.” The following then occurred:

Mr. Levinter: It is your first
occasion in court?

A. Yes, with the exception of giving expert
evidence.

Q. Have you never been in court before?

A. No.

Q. Never in police court before?

A. No, sir.

Mr. Levinter: Am I entitled to now on
the question of credibility?

His Lordship: No, I don’t think so.

Mr. Walker: I object to these
innuendoes my friend is constantly making.

Mr. Hughes: Do you mind if I say that
after Your Lordship’s ruling my friend has directly gone through it; now, My
Lord, may I withdraw any objection and let the jury have whatever he has got in
his head so that there will be no questions said to the jury afterwards that we
endeavoured to keep anything back, let him put it in.

His Lordship: Very well.

Cross-examining counsel then elicited from the
witness that on certain charges of speeding in 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1943 he
paid fines, but the witness said that other persons drove his car as well as
himself and he was unable to say whether on any of the occasions he himself had
been driving. He also said that on none of the occasions had he appeared in
court.

Somewhat inadvisedly counsel for the respondent
Nasmith, who preceded counsel for the appellant, said in the course of his
address to the jury:

By innuendo he gets it across to you people
that this man is a speed fiend, a terrible fellow—just by innuendo—that he is
full of convictions, that he must have been in court many times; then my
learned friend fortunately brings out, “Well, let us hear all about

[Page 281]

this”, I had not heard about it, and we
find over a period of driving as many miles as he does in a year, we find over
the period of those years a certain number of fines for speeding; my friend
does not bring forward and indicate who is fined.

Appellant’s counsel followed in due course and
the following occurred:

My friend bitterly complains that I brought
out these convictions for speeding; gentlemen, I would have laughed, just as
you laughed yesterday, if I had brought out that in 1938 he was speeding
so much, we all laugh sometimes when these things happen, but you do not have
two in 1938, and one in 1939, and you don’t have another in 1940, you don’t
have another in 1943—

His Lordship: Mr. Levinter, just a
moment; you brought that evidence as to credibility and nothing else, now you
are using it for exactly the other purpose—

Mr. Levinter: My friend raised it in
his argument at great length, and surely I am entitled to respond to my learned
friend’s argument.

His Lordship: Proceed.

Mr. Levinter: Those are the only times
that he was convicted apparently, now was he putting on speed on this occasion?

By section 26 of The Highway Traffic Act
it is provided that no vehicle shall be driven upon any highway within a
city, town or village at a greater speed than thirty miles an hour except in
certain special localities, and at fifty miles per hour outside such
municipalities. By sub‑section (4), any person “who violates” any of
the provisions of the section is rendered liable to certain penalties,
including certain fines.

By section 46 it is provided that the owner
of a motor vehicle shall “incur the penalties” provided for any violation of
the Act unless at the time of such violation the motor vehicle was in the
possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, without the
owner’s consent, and the driver not being the owner is also made liable for
such penalties.

Accordingly, even assuming that a breach of the
speed limit laid down by the statute would constitute a “crime” within the
meaning of sub-section (1) of section 18 of The Evidence Act, which
we do not consider it necessary to decide, the appellant did not establish, as
to any of the convictions, that it was the witness who had “violated” the
statute.

We are of the opinion that, assuming evidence as
to these convictions was admissible at all, such evidence could only have been
adduced if counsel were in a position to

[Page 282]

show that the witness had himself committed the
offences. We think that the withdrawal of objection on the part of counsel for
the respondents must be deemed to have proceeded on the assumption that this
would be done. On this ground alone we think that the order for a new trial
must be affirmed. We do not think it open to the appellant to contend that the
course pursued did not have its intended effect. We therefore think that the
onus resting upon the respondents under section 27 of The Judicature
Act, R.S.O. 1937, Cap. 100, has been met.

With respect to the direction that the new trial
should be without a jury, we think that, as a jury is an eminently proper
tribunal for the trial of the matters that are in issue between the parties,
sufficient ground has not been shown to deprive the appellant of that right.
Whether, in view of the right to a jury given by section 55 of The Judicature
Act, and the authority thereby and by the Rules conferred upon the trial
judge, the order in appeal can be supported, need not be decided. There rests
with the trial judge sufficient power and authority to conduct the trial as it
should be conducted, and, should he see reason to try the action without a jury
or to dispense with the jury at any stage, his discretion is not subject to
review; Currie v. Motor Union Insurance Co.[2]; Wilson v. Kinnear[3]. We think that the course followed in Reiffenstein
v. Dey[4] should
be followed here and the direction complained of must therefore be set aside.

The appeal will therefore be allowed in part as
indicated. The right to a trial by jury is a substantial right, and, as success
is divided, we think there should be no costs of this appeal. The costs below
will not be interfered

ON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA

Negligence—Crown—Workmen’s
compensation—Damages—Death through accident caused by negligence of servant of
the Crown (Dom.)—Action on behalf of dependents of deceased under Families’
Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1986, c. 98, claiming damages against the
Crown—Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 8A (as amended), ss. 19(c),
50A—Claim and acceptance, prior to the action, of compensation from the
Workmen’s Compensation Board of British Columbia—Question as to effect thereof
on right of action or extent of recovery—Workmen’s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1986, c. 812, s. 11—Subrogation of the Board—Board a co-suppliant in the
action.

The husband of S, while working in the course
of his employment by one D, in the province of British Columbia, was the victim
of an accident through which he died, which accident was caused by the
negligence of a member of the Canadian military forces while acting within the
scope of his duties or employment. S was awarded compensation for herself and
her infant son by the Workmen’s Compensation Board of British
 Columbia under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, c. 312. She brought the present action (by petition of right) for the
benefit of herself and her son under the Families’ Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, c, 93, claiming damages against the Crown by virtue of ss. 19 (c) and 50A
of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34 (as amended in 1938, c.
28, and 1943, c. 25). S. 11 of said Workmen’s Compensation Act provide
for cases where an accident happens in such circumstances as entitle the
workman or his dependents “to an action against some person other than his
employer”, and subs. 3 thereof provides in effect that, if a workman or
dependent claims compensation from said Board, the Board shall be subrogated to
the rights of the workman or dependent as against such other person. In the
present action the Board was a co-suppliant, pleading its statutory right of
subrogation, and also an equitable assignment in writing from S to it.

Held: The
claiming and acceptance by S of compensation under said Workmen’s
Compensation Act did not bar her right to recover, nor affect the amount
recoverable, from the Crown in the present action. S. 11(3) of that Act only
affected rights as between the dependents and the Board. The direction by the
Exchequer Court that the amount it awarded as damages to S should be payable to
the Board and the amount it awarded as damages to her son should be paid into
court to abide the Court’s order, with liberty to the Board to apply for a
declaration as to its rights, was unobjectionable.

Judgment in the Exchequer
 Court, [1945] Ex. C.R. 250, affirmed. 

[Page 220]

APPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of the
Honourable Mr. Justice Sidney Smith, Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of
Canada [1], in
favour of the suppliants against the Crown (in right of the Dominion of Canada)
for damages.

The action was brought (by petition of right)
for damages by reason of the death through accident of Bertram, Snell who was,
at the time of the accident, working in the course of his employment as a
servant of one Dines, in the province of British Columbia. The accident was
caused by negligence of a member of the Canadian military forces while acting
within the scope of his duties or employment. The action was brought on behalf
of the widow of the deceased and her infant son, under the Families’
Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 93, and amendments thereto. Prior to
the action the widow had claimed and been awarded compensation for herself and
her son by the Workmen’s Compensation Board of British
 Columbia under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, c. 312. The said Board was a co-suppliant in the action, pleading that it
was subrogated, pursuant to provisions of s. 11 of the said Workmen’s
Compensation Act, to the claims of the dependents, and also pleading an
equitable assignment in writing from the widow to it.

On behalf of the Crown it was alleged that in
consequence of the election by the widow to claim compensation, and payment to
and acceptance by her of the monthly award of the Board for herself and her son
as compensation for the death of her husband, she had suffered no loss or
damage in law which would entitle her to maintain an action against the Crown
under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 24 (an
alternative submission in the present appeal was that she had no claim except
to the extent that the award to her under the Workmen’s Compensation Act had
not fully compensated her); that she had assigned her right of action and, as a
result, was not entitled to maintain an action; that the provisions of the said
Workmen’s Compensation Act were not applicable

[Page 221]

to the Crown and that the suppliant Board
could acquire no right of action against the Crown by subrogation under that
Act.

The contentions of the parties are further
stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.

By the formal judgment in the Exchequer Court
it was ordered that the suppliants were entitled to recover from the Crown, as
damages suffered by the widow the sum of $13,500 payable to the Board and by
them to be dealt with in due course, and as damages suffered by the son the sum
of $3,500 to be paid into court to the credit of the suppliants to abide the
order of the Court, and that the Board be at liberty to apply to the Court for
a declaration that the Board is by subrogation entitled to the said sum of
$3,500 and to payment out to them of said sum.

W. R. Jackett for
the appellant.

F. A. Sheppard, K.C. for the respondents.

Kerwin, J.—On September 29, 1943, Bertram Snell died in consequence of a
collision between two motor trucks on a highway in the Province
 of British Columbia. The collision was occasioned by
the negligence of Sapper Neufeld, a member of the military forces of His
Majesty in the right of Canada,
which negligence occurred while Neufeld was acting within the scope of his
duties or employment. At the time, Snell was engaged in the course of his
employment in driving a truck of his employer, one Dines, and the collision
occurred between that truck and one owned by the Dominion Crown and driven by
Neufeld. This Court has not had occasion to pass upon the judgment of the Exchequer Court in McArthur v. The
King [2],
where it was decided that a member of the Non-Permanent Active Militia of
Canada on active service was not an officer or servant of the Crown within
section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act , and it is not now necessary to
do so as section 50A of that Act, as enacted by chapter 25 of the Statutes of
1943, provides:

50A. For the purpose of determining
liability in any action or other proceeding by or against His Majesty, a person
who was at any time since the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand nine
hundred and

[Page 222]

thirty-eight, a member of the naval,
military or air forces of His Majesty in right of Canada shall be deemed to have been at such time a servant of the Crown.

For another reason the date, June 24, 1938, is
of importance, as it was then that chapter 28 of the statutes of that year was
assented to, by which section 19 (c) was repealed and re-enacted but with the
omission of the words “on any public work” at the end thereof.

It has been authoritatively determined that
section 19 (c) not only conferred jurisdiction upon the Exchequer Court to
adjudicate the classes of claims described but also that in such cases
liability is imposed upon the Crown to respond in damages for the negligence of
its officers or servants where, in like circumstances, such a liability would
rest upon a subject corporation or individual according to the law of the
province in which the claim arose as that law existed at the time when the Exchequer
Court Act  began to operate: Canadian National Railway Co. v. Saint
John Motor Line Limited [3].
Prior to June 24, 1938, even if Neufeld were an officer or servant of the
Crown, a petition of right for, such an occurrence as the one here in question
could not have succeeded, since the negligence was not committed during
Neufeld’s presence on a public work: The King v. Dubois [4]; The King v.
Moscovitz [5].
June 24, 1938, must, therefore, be taken as the date as of which the question
must be determined whether in like circumstances a liability would rest upon a
subject. At that time there was in force in British
 Columbia the Families’ Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, chapter 93, whereby an action for damages for the death of Snell might be
brought against the wrongdoer by and in the name of the widow for the benefit
of herself and infant son. There was also in force the Workmen’s
Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, chapter 312.

A petition of right was accordingly brought
against the Crown by the widow for damages for Snell’s death. The accident
having happened in such circumstances as entitled a workman’s dependent to an
action against some person other than the workman’s employer, and the widow
having claimed under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the

[Page 223]

Workmen’s Compensation Board of British Columbia established thereby is, by
virtue of subsection 3 of section 11, “subrogated to the rights of the workman
or dependent as against such other person for the whole or any outstanding part
of the claim of the workman or dependent against such other person.” The Board
also took an equitable assignment in writing from the widow. The Board was
joined as a co-suppliant, not as a necessary party,—since the claim is that of
the widow on behalf of herself and her infant son—but as a proper party.

The dispute of the claim is founded upon the
facts that the widow had a right to claim compensation under the provisions of
the Workmen’s Compensation Act although she might choose not to exercise
it; that she did make such a claim; that the Board ordered that certain monthly
sums be paid to her for herself and for the son; and that these sums have been
and are being paid. Although it is doubtful if the point is open on the
pleadings, it was also argued that even if these circumstances did not defeat
the present claim, the compensation awarded under the Workmen’s Compensation
Act should lessen pro tanto the sum awarded by the trial judge.

If the appellant’s arguments were sound, they
would apply as well between subjects as between the Crown and subject. It is
well settled that it is only pecuniary loss for which compensation is to be
paid under Lord Campbell’s Act and legislation similar thereto, such as the British Columbia Families’ Compensation
Act, and that any pecuniary advantage a dependent has received from the
death must be set off against her probable loss. In Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v.
Jennings (1), the Privy Council decided, in an action under the Ontario Fatal
Accidents Act as it then stood, that while the total amount of a life
insurance policy need not as a matter of law be deducted from what would
otherwise be payable as the pecuniary loss contemplated by the Act, the receipt
of the insurance money was a proper circumstance to be taken into
consideration. This has since been changed by statute in Ontario but not in British
 Columbia. In litigation between subjects, an action by
the dependent of a workman whose (1) (1888) 13 App. Cas. 800.

[Page 224]

death was caused by a third party would not be
defeated by reason merely of the dependent’s right to claim compensation under
the Workmen’s Compensation Act. If the dependent had claimed
compensation, the Board, by subsection 3 of section 11, would have been
“subrogated to the rights of the workman or dependent as against such other
person for the whole or any outstanding part of the claim of the workman or
dependent against such other person.” It is not necessary to determine
precisely to what the words “or any outstanding part” refer, but I am satisfied
that they would not apply so as to reduce the claim of the dependent against a
subject wrongdoer. The Board is subrogated to the dependent’s rights against
the third party and the Board’s rights would not be defeated or curtailed by
anything done by the dependent. That is, as between subjects, it seems clear
that the wrongdoer could not successfully contend that the legislature intended
that the receipt by a dependent of compensation under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act should be deducted from the sum otherwise payable under
the Families’ Compensation Act. If that were so, the subrogation of the
Board to the dependent’s rights would be illusory. Liability to the same extent
attaches to the Crown.

Mrs. Snell is therefore entitled on behalf of
herself and her infant son to damages. No question was raised as to the amounts
allowed by the trial judge and nothing is said, therefore, as to the manner of
their compilation. The petition of right being carried on at the instance of
the Board, even if it were not a party, the judgment would still be in favour
of the widow and infant. As between the Board and the widow and her son, the
former is entitled to the amounts awarded and I think there is ample power in
the Exchequer Court to direct, as has been done in this case, that the damages
suffered by the widow should be payable to the Board, and that the damages
suffered by the infant should be paid into Court for the benefit of all the
suppliants to abide the order of the Court, with liberty to the Board to apply
for a declaration that it is entitled by subrogation to the same sum and to
payment out to the Board thereof.

The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

[Page 225]

The judgment of Taschereau and Estey JJ., was
delivered by

Estey J.—The late husband of the respondent, Bessie May Snell, was killed
in a collision between a truck driven by himself, in the course of his
employment, and an army vehicle driven by a soldier. Mrs. Snell applied for and
received compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, c. 312.

This action is brought by the Workmen’s
Compensation Board of British Columbia and Mrs. Snell against the Crown in the right of the Dominion. The
Board pleads an equitable assignment from Mrs. Snell to it and its right to
subrogation under section 11(3) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.

The pleadings admit that the late Mr. Snell’s
death was caused by the negligence of the driver of the army vehicle and
therefore that Mrs. Snell had an action against the Crown in the right of the
Dominion by virtue of her position under the Families’ Compensation Act, R.S.B.C.
1936, c. 93, and her consequent rights tinder section 19 (c) and section 50A  of
the Exchequer Court Act , R.S.C. 1927, e. 34, as amended 1938 S.C., c.
28, and 1943 S.C., c. 25.

The Crown, however, contends that so far as Mrs.
Snell is concerned, having received compensation under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act, she has either suffered no pecuniary loss, or
alternatively has been fully compensated therefor and therefore has no cause of
action, or in the further alternative that she is entitled to only the
difference between what she has been awarded under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act and what may be found to be full compensation.

So far as the Workmen’s Compensation Board is
concerned, the Crown sets up a number of defences which may be summarized thus:
that the Board suffered no pecuniary damage; the assignment is ineffective as
against the Crown; and section 11(3) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act does
not give any remedy to the Board against the Crown in the right of the
Dominion.

An examination of Mrs. Snell’s position under
the provincial Workmen’s Compensation Act and under the sections of the Exchequer
Court Act  already referred to indicates

[Page 226]

that she had both a claim under the provincial
Act and under the Exchequer Court Act . The contention here is that,
having exercised her right and having accepted compensation under provincial
legislation, that election on her part has barred her right to recover from the
Crown in the right of the Dominion, if not completely, then to the extent that
she has recovered compensation under that Act.

The position of one who elects under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act of Ontario
was determined by this Court in Toronto Railway Company v. Button [6], where Mr. Justice Duff (later Chief Justice) stated at p. 421 :

If he elects to claim compensation, the
employer becomes subrogated to the claimant’s rights against the third person;
in other words, he becomes entitled to enjoy the benefit of them and may
enforce them in the name of the claimant. But all this is intended to be and is
a disposition as to the rights of the employer and the claimant inter se.

And at p. 422:

It follows, of course, that the
transactions between the Board and the plaintiff are transactions to which for
the purpose of this litigation the appellant company is a stranger and that
they do not afford any answer to the respondent’s claim in the action.

The material provisions of the Workmen’s
Compensation Act of British Columbia here under consideration are to the same effect as those of the
Ontario Act in Toronto Railway Company v. Hutton, supra. It
follows, therefore, that the position of the party whose negligence caused the
injury is unaffected by the provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.

The compensation under the statute is in no way
a settlement of Mrs. Snell’s claim for damages arising out of the negligence of
the appellant. The basis for the compensation under the statute, that of
“injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment”, is a much
wider and different basis from that of a claim founded in negligence. A
computation of the claim is also, as set out in the statute, quite different
from that which would be followed in a negligence action. Moreover, the Workmen’s
Compensation Act provides in effect that the claim of Mrs. Snell at common law
for damages continues and may be enforced. It therefore follows that the
contention of the

[Page 227]

Crown that whatever damages Mrs. Snell may have
suffered have been recovered and because thereof she has no further claim, is
not tenable.

The statute does provide that, in the event of
the party entitled to compensation accepting same, the Board is subrogated to
or stands in the position of the party receiving compensation as against the
party whose negligence caused the action. These are matters entirely between
the party entitled to compensation and the Board. In this case both of these
are parties to the action. It therefore becomes unnecessary to determine
certain of the issues raised had the action been brought in the name of the
Board only.

Both were parties to the action as framed and
tried in the Exchequer Court.
There the learned trial judge in his judgment directed how the funds received
should be dealt with as between the Board, Mrs. Snell and her infant son. If
the appeal otherwise failed, this disposition of the funds was not objected to.

The appeal should be dismissed and the judgment
of the Exchequer Court
affirmed.

Rand J.—In this case, the Dominion Crown, liable for the tort of its
servant, claims a deduction from damages recoverable by the widow and child
under the Families’ Compensation Act of British
 Columbia, of the sums payable to them under the Workmen’s
Compensation Act. The contention is that the death statute is intended
merely to maintain to the dependents the benefits they would have received if
death had not ensued the accident, and that there must be taken into account
all benefits that arise to them by reason of the death.

There is no doubt a distinction has been
established between the effect on damages of such benefits in the case of
injuries not causing death and those that result fatally. In Bradburn v.
Great Western Ry. Co. [7],
the court excluded evidence of moneys received under a policy of accident
insurance, on the ground concisely stated by Pigott, B. in these words:

He does not receive that sum of money
because of the accident, but because he has made a contract providing for the
contingency; an accident must occur to entitle him to it, but it is not the
accident, but his contract, which is the cause of his receiving it.

[Page 228]

A different rule in death cases was first
applied by Lord Campbell in Hicks v. Newport, etc., Ry. Co. [8], where he directed the jury to deduct from the aggregate sum found
the amount of accident insurance accruing to the persons claiming. In Grand
Trunk Ry. Co. v. Jennings [9], a further
distinction was recognized between life and accident insurance, and it was held
that the former should be regarded only to the extent that its payment may have
been accelerated. This seems to rest on the view that the benefit of the
accident insurance was a legal consequence of the act of the wrongdoer, that as
death might never happen from accident, the act brought about, in a legal
sense, not only the loss but the mitigation; but that in an insurance against
death alone, only time separates the beneficiary from the benefit. The ruling
as to accident insurance has been superseded, however, by an amendment to the
English Act passed in 1908.

The question, then, is whether the rule applies
to such a right as that to compensation under the Workmen’s Act, and in my
opinion it does not.

Section 11 of that Act is as follows:

11. (1) Where an accident happens to a
workman in the course of his employment in such circumstances as entitle him or
his dependents to an action against some person other than his employer, the
workman or his dependents, if entitled to compensation under this Part, may
claim such compensation or may bring such action.

(2) If the workman or his dependents bring
such action and less is recovered and collected than the amount of the
compensation to which the workman or dependents would be entitled under this
Part, the workman or dependents shall be entitled to compensation under this
Part to the extent of the amount of the difference.

(3) If any such workman or dependent makes
an application to the Board claiming compensation under this Part, the Board
shall be subrogated to the rights of the workman or dependent as against such
other person for the whole or any outstanding part of the claim of the workman
or dependent against such other person.

(4) In any case within the provisions of
subsection (1), neither the workman nor his dependents nor the employer of the
workman shall have any right of action in respect of the accident against an
employer in any industry within the scope of this Part; and in any such case
where it appears to the satisfaction of the Board that a workman of an employer
in any class is injured owing to the negligence of an employer or of the
workman of an employer in another class within the scope of this Part, the
Board may direct that the compensation awarded in such case shall be charged
against the last-mentioned class.

[Page 229]

It will be seen that the section deals
specifically with the right of dependents under the Families’ Act so as to
create in effect a quasi indemnity and to subrogate the Board to the
rights of the dependents when they have accepted compensation. But it is
obvious that if such moneys can be deducted from the amount recoverable on the
tort, the subrogation would be nullified. It would in fact reverse the plain
purpose of the section and place upon the compensation fund pro tanto a
primary liability. In the result, the Board at most would be entitled only to
the excess of the claim against the wrongdoer over the compensation, the
portion which equitably belongs to the dependents. The intention is clearly to
preserve in full the cause of action, including damages, against the wrongdoer
and to create a legal right in the Board to enforce it in the name of the dependents
for the benefit of the compensation fund. Now the insurances held deductible
were absolute in obligation; but the section, by importing that quality of
indemnity, invests the right to compensation with a character outside of the
category of benefits within the rule.

The Board is a co-petitioner and the judgment
provides for the payment to it of the moneys recovered for the benefit of the
widow. In the case of the child, the direction is to pay the sum recovered into
Court with liberty to the Board to apply for a declaration of interest.

The effect of the statutory subrogation, a
matter solely between the dependent and the Board, is to constitute the
dependent a trustee of the right of action for the Board. The petitioners are,
therefore, trustee and cestui que trust.

Whether or not that relationship raises in the
Board an equitable right against the Crown, I do not find necessary to decide.
The defence in this respect alleges simply that the Workman’s Act is not
applicable to the Crown, and that the Board “can acquire no right of action
against the respondent by subrogation under the said Act”, which I take to mean
can create no legal right and to deny the competency of provincial legislation
to affect a claim against the Crown given by a Dominion Act. But that leaves
untouched the question whether the Crown is bound to recognize the beneficial
ownership of such a claim. There

[Page 230]

is no doubt that many petitions of right have
been presented and determined in chancery without challenge to the jurisdiction
of the court to entertain them. The consideration that the remedies used by
equity to enforce its decrees could not, by their nature, operate against the
Crown is not present in a relation which permits the coercion of the court to
be exercised upon a private person. The question is examined in chapter 11 of
Clode on Petition of Right, where the instances in which petitions have been
actually dealt with are enumerated. In an analogous case, In re Rolt [10], the petitioners were
the assignees of a bankrupt contractor with the Crown, and I see no ground in
principle why an interest of this nature should not be admitted against the
Crown where it can be made effectual by a remedy operating upon the trustee: The
Queen v. Smith [11],
Strong J., at p. 66:

Had the proof borne out this case, and had
it appeared that the assignment was so limited, the suppliants would have been
undoubtedly entitled to recover in respect of work actually performed by the
original contractors, for such an equitable assignment would have been entirely
free from objection, either upon the general law, or upon any provision
contained in the contract, and the record would have been properly framed for
relief upon such a state of facts.

Its convenience is obvious; to the Crown, the
result is indifferent; it conforms to the equitable rule of concluding all
features of. a controversy in the one proceeding; and it secures the interest
of a semi-public body.

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with
costs.

Kellock J.—The contention of the Crown is that the dependents of the
deceased, being entitled to compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation
Act, have no right of action under section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court
Act , and alternatively, have no claim except to the extent that the amount
awarded under the Compensation Act has not fully compensated them in respect of
their claim under the Families’ Compensation Act. It is further
submitted in any event that the respondent Board has no claim at all under
section 19 (c) and that the Workmen’s Compensation Act is ineffective to
give it any.

[Page 231]

It is, of course, well settled that the damage
awarded under statutes of the nature of the Families’ Compensation Act are
limited to the pecuniary benefit which the dependents might reasonably have expected
from the continuance of the life of the deceased. By reason of the provisions
of section 19 (c), the Crown becomes liable to pay such damages when the death
has been caused in circumstances such as are here admittedly present.

Turning to the Workmen’s Compensation Act, section
11 is as follows:

(1) Where an accident happens to a workman
in the course of his employment in such circumstances as entitle him or his
dependents to an action against some person other than his employer, the
workman or his dependents, if entitled to compensation under this Part, may
claim such compensation or may bring such action.

(2) If the workman or his dependents bring
such action and less is recovered and collected than the amount of the
compensation to which the workman or dependents would be entitled under this
Part, the workman or dependents shall be entitled to compensation under this
Part to the extent of the amount of the difference.

(3) If any such workman or dependent makes
an application to the Board claiming compensation under this Part, the Board
shall be subrogated to the rights of the workman or dependent as against such
other person for the whole or any outstanding part of the claim of the workman
or dependent against such other person.

It is the submission of the Crown that the
compensation provided by the above section is full compensation equivalent by
the law of the province to the pecuniary value of the support the widow and her
son would have received from the deceased and that consequently no loss has been
sustained. The Crown further says that if the award is not by law full
compensation, the Crown is liable only for any deficiency. The contention in
effect is that the provision by way of Workmen’s Compensation operates in ease
of the tort-feasor. The Crown further says that section 11(3) cannot confer any
right upon the respondents as against the Crown.

It is said in answer by the respondents that
while it is true that provincial legislation may not bind the Crown in the
right of the Dominion ex proprio vigore, nonetheless the Crown may not
take the benefit of the provisions entitling the dependents to compensation
without reference

[Page 232]

to the terms upon which compensation is awarded,
namely, the statutory subrogation of the Board to the rights of the dependents
as against the wrong-doer.

It is said that where statutory rights are in
question, as distinct from common law rights, Crooke’s Case [12] is authority for the
view that if the Crown, in order to establish rights it claims, must invoke the
very statute which conditions those rights, the Crown is bound by the
derogation, and reference is made to Re Excelsior Electric Dairy Machinery
Ltd. [13]
and to Attorney General for British Columbia v. Royal Bank of Canada [14], per Macdonald, J. A.,
at 294 and 297.

I do not find it necessary to pass upon the
soundness of this contention, as I think the respondents are entitled to
succeed upon the basis of their further contention, namely, that the relevant
sections of the Workmen’s Compensation Act are to be construed as
affecting inter se the rights of the dependents and the Board only; Toronto
Railway Company v. Hutton [15];
and has no effect upon the liability of the Crown under section 19 (c) to the
person injured or his dependents.

In Workmen’s Compensation Board v. Canadian
Pacific Railway Co. [16],
it was held that the rights given by section 8 of the then Act, 6 Geo. V, Cap.
77, constituted a statutory contract made with the workman for his benefit and
for the benefit of members of his family dependent upon him. I think the
principle of this decision is not limited to a case within section 8 where the
accident happens outside the province, but applies equally to cases in which
the accident takes place within the province. The relevant provisions of the
statute here in question, R.S.B.C, cap. 312, are not materially different from
the Act of 1916.

Hutton’s case[17] was decided under the Ontario statute of which the corresponding
provisions are not in essence dissimilar from those of the British Columbia statute. It was held in
that case that an election to claim compensation under the Act did not bar the
claim of the injured workman against the tort-feasor. In the language of

[Page 233]

Mignault J., with whom the Chief Justice and
Brodeur J. agreed, at p. 426, the subrogation effected by the statute “gives
the * * * Board the control of the action”, but does not divest the right of
action from the workman or his dependents. The main contention of the
appellant, therefore, in my opinion, fails.

The formal judgment directs recovery by both the
Board and Bessie May Snell, payment to be made to the Board. It is objected
that:

(a) the provincial legislation is
incompetent to give the Board any right of action in its own name against
appellant, and that,

(b) the assignment by Bessie May Snell to
the Board is equally ineffective, as the right of action is ex delicto and
therefore not the subject of assignment.

Mignault J., in dealing with a similar
contention in Hutton’s case (1), said at pp. 427-428:

* * * the appellant appears to me to be
without interest to complain of this modification of the judgment. By paying
the damages according to the judgment it will be discharged from any possible
claim either by the respondent or by the Board.

In the present case, as in Hutton’s case [18], the essential ground of the appeal and of
the defence to the action was that the election of the respondent Snell to
claim compensation barred the action. In my opinion, what happens with respect
to the proceeds of the judgment as between the respondents in view of the
discharge involved in payment, is a matter which, at this stage of the action,
does not concern the appellant.

I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO

Criminal law—Indictment for attempted
rape—Verdict of assault causing
bodily harm—Appellate court substituting conviction of common assault—Appeal to this Court by the Crown—Conviction to be changed to that of indecent assault—Conviction for
“included” offences under section 951 Cr. C—Sections 72, 292(c), 800, 1016 Cr. C.

A jury, upon an indictment for attempted
rape, returned a verdict of assault upon a female, causing actual bodily harm.
Upon an appeal by the accused, the Court of Appeal held that an indictment for
attempted rape did not include the offence for which he was found guilty, and
the Court then substituted a conviction for common assault. The Crown appealed
to this Court, asking that the substituted conviction be changed to that of
indecent assault.

Held that the
appeal should be dismissed.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kerwin, Kellock and Estey JJ.:—The offence of indecent assault may
be included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 Cr. C; but, in this
case, it was not open to the appellate court, in view of the finding of the
jury, to substitute a conviction of indecent assault.

Per The Chief
Justice and Estey JJ.:—The jury, in finding the accused not guilty as charged
on the count of attempted rape, negatived the existence of the element of
indecency and in effect found the accused not guilty of indecent assault.
Therefore, the appellate court, so far as substituting one conviction for
another under section 1016 (2) Cr. C, had no other course open to it than to
substitute that of common assault.

Per Kerwin and
Kellock JJ.:—Section 1016 (2) Cr. C. requires it to appear to the Court of
Appeal on the actual finding that the jury “must” have been satisfied of facts
which proved the respondent guilty of indecent assault.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1947] O.R.
1) affirmed.

APPEAL by the Crown, upon leave to appeal
granted under section 1025 Cr. C, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, allowing in part an appeal by the respondent from a conviction of
having committed an assault upon a female causing bodily harm and substituting
a conviction of common assault.

W. B. Common K.C. for the appellant.

Vera L. Parsons K.C. for the respondent.

[Page 235]

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Estey
J. was delivered by

Estey J.:—The accused was indicted for attempted rape under section 300  of
the Criminal Code . The learned trial judge instructed the jury that included in
the count of attempted rape were the other offences of indecent assault,
assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm (sec. 292 (c)), and common
assault.

The jury returned a verdict of assault on a
female occasioning actual bodily harm.

Upon an appeal by the accused the appellate
court in Ontario held that an
indictment for attempted rape did not include the offence of assault on a
female occasioning actual bodily harm within the meaning of section 951. The
learned judges of that court then substituted under sec. 1016(2) a verdict of
common assault and imposed sentence of one year in reformatory.

The accused does not appeal but the Crown
appeals to this court and asks that the substituted verdict of common assault
be changed to that of indecent assault.

Leave to appeal was granted to the Crown on the
basis that Rex v. Stewart (1) in which the Appellate Division in
Alberta held that the offence of indecent assault is by virtue of the
provisions of section 951 included in a count of attempted rape and, therefore,
is in conflict with the decision of the appellate court of Ontario in this
case.

The commission of the offence of rape includes
an act of indecency, as stated by my Lord the Chief Justice in Wright v.
The King 2:

No doubt in a crime such as the one (rape)
under consideration, the initial step might be stated to be an indecent
assault, followed by the subsequent step which might be described as an attempt
to rape * * *

Section 72  of the Criminal Code  defines an
attempt:

Every one who, having an intent to commit
an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of accomplishing his object,
is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence intended whether under the
circumstances it was possible to commit such offence or not.

This section requires that one to be guilty of
an attempt must intend to commit the completed offence and to have done some
act toward the accomplishment of that

[Page 236]

objective. That act must be beyond preparation
and go so far toward the commission of the completed offence that but for some
intervention he is prevented or desists from the completion thereof.

Acts remotely leading towards the
commission of the offence are not to be considered as attempts to commit it but
acts immediately connected with it are. Parke B. in Reg. v. Eagleton3,
quoted by Lord Reading C.J. in Rex v. Robinson 4.

It is the existence of both the intent and the
act in such a relationship that the former may be regarded as the cause of the
latter. The intent unaccompanied by the act does not constitute a criminal
offence.

In the early case of Rex v. Scofield 5,
Lord Mansfield stated at p. 403:

So long as an act rests in bare intention,
it is not punishable by our laws: but immediately when an act is done, the law
judges, not only of the act done, but of the intent with which it is done; and,
if it is coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent, though the act itself
would otherwise have been innocent, the intent being criminal, the act becomes
criminal and punishable.

This case is commented upon in Broom’s Legal
Maxims, 6th Ed. p. 305:

It is a rule, laid down by Lord Mansfield,
and which has been said to comprise all the principles of previous decisions
upon this subject, that so long as an act rests in bare intention, it is not
punishable by our laws; but when an act is done, the law judges not only of the
act itself, but of the intent with which it was done; and if the act be coupled
with an unlawful and malicious intent, though in itself the act would otherwise
have been innocent, yet, the intent being criminal, the act likewise becomes
criminal and punishable.

It appears from the foregoing that the intent
may determine the criminal quality of the act. There is present in the offence
of rape the intent to commit an indecent act. The same intent is required in
the offence of attempted rape. In the latter that intent may be found from the
nature of the act or from the conduct of the accused immediately associated
with the commission of that act or indeed both. If such an intent be not
present the offence of attempted rape is not committed. The act cannot be dissociated
from the intent as evidence which caused the accused to do such act.

[Page 237]

In Rex v. Louie Chong6,
the magistrate found the accused guilty of indecent assault and stated a case
for the opinion of the appellate division in Ontario as to whether he was justified in finding the accused guilty of
indecent assault, where the accused in taking hold of the girl did so in a
manner that did not import indecency. At the same time, however, he offered her
money to go with him for an immoral purpose. The judgment of the court written
by Middleton J. affirmed the magistrate’s conviction. His Lordship in
delivering the judgment stated:

It appears to me that an act in itself
ambiguous may be interpreted by the surrounding circumstances and by words
spoken at the time the act is committed * * *. It is in each case a question of
fact whether the thing which was done, in the circumstances in which it was
done, was done indecently. If it was, an indecent assault has been committed.

His spoken words which were part of his conduct
evidenced the intention of the accused and determined the criminal quality of
his act.

It would, therefore, appear that a count
charging an attempt to commit rape would include the offence of indecent
assault under section 951.

Though the offence of indecent assault is
included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 it was not in this
case, because of the finding of the jury, open to the appellate court to
substitute a verdict of indecent assault. Section 951 provides that the

accused may be convicted of any offence so
included which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved * *
*

The learned trial judge explained to the jury
the ingredients essential to find the accused guilty upon one or other of the
four counts. Those of attempted rape and indecent assault require a finding of
indecency, while that of actual bodily harm to a female does not. The jury in
finding the accused not guilty as charged on the count of attempted rape
negatived the existence of the element of indecency and, therefore, in effect
found the accused not guilty of indecent assault.

Where an indictment contained three counts: (1)
that the accused did unlawfully kill, under section 268; (2) grievous bodily
harm, sec. 284; and (3) wanton or furious

[Page 238]

driving, sec. 285, the jury found the accused
guilty of wanton or furious driving. Chief Justice Anglin stated at p. 47:

In a case such as that at bar, that the
jury had found that neither the whole offence charged in count No. 1 nor the
whole offence charged in count No. 2 had been proved, is an intendment which we
must make in support of the verdict.

And at p. 48:

It was within the province of the jury to
find that the offence charged in the third count was satisfactorily proven, but
that, for reasons which we can only surmise and as to the validity or the
adequacy of which we are not at liberty to inquire some essential element of
each of the offences charged in the first and second counts respectively was,
in their view, not established beyond reasonable doubt. Barton v. The
King7.

The jury in finding the accused guilty of
assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a female negatived the existence of
the element of indecency essential to the finding of a verdict of indecent
assault. Therefore, the appellate court could not conclude “that the jury * * *
must have been satisfied of the facts which proved him guilty of” indecent
assault as required by section 1016(2) before it can substitute a verdict of
guilty of that other offence. Rex v. Hayes and Pallante8;
Rex v. Collins9.

In a case where the accused was found guilty of
murder this court so satisfied was in a position to and did reduce the verdict
to one of manslaughter. At p. 350 Chief Justice Duff:

The finding makes it clear that the jury
must have been satisfied of the facts necessary to constitute manslaughter, and
we are, consequently, of opinion that the Court of Appeal would have authority
under s. 1016 to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict of the
jury and to pronounce sentence upon the prisoner. Rex v. Hopper10;
Manchuk v. The King11.

The learned judges in the appellate court,
because of the verdict of the jury, so far as substituting one verdict for
another under section 1016(2), had no other course open to them than to substitute
that of common assault.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 239]

The judgment of Kerwin and Kellock J.J. was delivered by

Kellock J.:—This is an appeal by the Attorney General of Ontario, pursuant to
leave granted under section 1025 (1)  of
the Criminal Code , from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated December 13, 1946.

The present respondent was charged with
attempted rape and on his trial before Schroeder J. and a jury was convicted of “assault upon a female
occasioning actual bodily harm”. The learned trial judge had charged the jury
that they might convict as charged, or of indecent assault, or assault upon a
female occasioning actual bodily harm or common assault or not guilty.

The respondent appealed in writing to the Court
of Appeal and on the hearing of the appeal the court raised the question
whether it was competent for the jury to return the verdict they had returned.
It was held that such a verdict was not open to the jury and the court
substituted a conviction of common assault, being of opinion that the jury by
their verdict, in view of the learned judge’s charge, had negatived indecent
assault. Roach J.A., who
delivered the judgment of the court, expressed disagreement with the decision
of the appellate division of Alberta in Rex v. Stewart12, by which it was held that, on a
charge of attempting to have carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of
fourteen, the accused might be convicted of indecent assault, under section 951 (1).

The Attorney General now appeals on the ground
that the Court of Appeal was in error in holding that indecent assault is not
an included offence in a charge of attempted rape. He asks that a conviction
for indecent assault be substituted. We are not called upon otherwise to
consider the judgment in appeal. Counsel for the respondent agrees with the
submission of the appellant that the Court of Appeal was in error in the view
taken with respect to indecent assault being included in the charge of the
indictment here in question.

If common assault be an included offence in a
charge of attempted rape as held by the Court of Appeal, and there can be no
question but that such an assault would

[Page 240]

be an act within section 72 , then such an act,
though in itself ambiguous, may, interpreted by the surrounding circumstances,
including words spoken at the time, amount to indecent assault; Rex v. Louie
Chong13. It is not necessary that the act
constituting the assault be in itself indecent in its nature. If the assault,
coupled with the intention required by section 72, is of such a nature as to
constitute an attempt within the rule as laid down in Rex v. Robinson14,
such assault must necessarily be indecent; Rex v. Louie Chong13.
In other words, the crime of attempted rape progresses from assault through indecent
assault to the complete crime. If the facts of the suppositious case referred
to by Roach J.A. amount to the offence of attempted rape, the assault itself
necessarily becomes indecent. This would appear to have been the view of the
majority in Wright v. The King15.

However, I agree with the Court of Appeal in the
view that it was not open to that court, in view of the learned trial judge’s
charge and the verdict of the jury, to substitute a conviction for indecent
assault. Section 1016 (2) requires it to appear to the Court of Appeal on the
actual finding that the jury “must” have been satisfied of facts which proved
the respondent guilty of indecent asault. The highest that Mr. Common puts his
argument, and properly so, is that:

It is quite possible that the jury might be
under the erroneous impression that a conviction for assault occasioning actual
bodily harm on a female was more serious than that of indecent assault.

That is not sufficient. I do not think that the
Court of Appeal were required, in the circumstances here present, to come to
the conclusion the statute requires.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

Taschereau J.:—I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Accused convicted of murder—New
trial ordered by appellate court—Misdirection—Wrongful admission of statements
by accused—Alleged conflict of decisions on latter ground—Accused still
entitled to new trial on ground of misdirection—Section 1025, Cr. C.

The respondent, convicted of murder, appealed
to the Court of Appeal, which, by an unanimous judgment, granted a new trial on
two grounds: misdirection by the trial judge and statements by the respondent,
while in custody, wrongly admitted in evidence. On a petition by the Crown for
leave to appeal to this Court under section 1925 Cr. C.

Held that the
application should be refused.—Even if the Crown had shown that the judgment to
be appealed from, on the question of admissibility of the alleged confessions,
conflicted with the judgment of any other court of appeal, and this Court came
to the conclusion that the Court of Appeal were wrong, the respondent would
still be entitled to a new trial on the ground of misdirection by the trial
judge, on which point no conflict had been shown. Ouvrard v. Quebec
Paper Box Co. Ltd. ([1945] S.C.R. 1) approved.

[Page 212]

MOTION by the Crown, before the Honourable
Mr. Justice Taschereau in Chambers, for leave to appeal to this Court under
section 1025 Cr. C. from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
granting a new trial to the respondent[1].

W.B. Common K.C. and C.R. Magone K.C. for
the motion.

J.J. Robinette K.C. contra.

TASCHEREAU J.:—The respondent was convicted of
murder and sentenced to hang, at the Assizes at Hamilton on the 16th of
October, 1946.

She appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario,
and a new trial was granted on two grounds, (1) that the learned trial judge
made errors of non-direction and misdirection in his charge to the jury and (2)
that certain statements alleged to have been made by the respondent to police
officers, while in custody, had been wrongly admitted in evidence against her.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario
having been unanimous[2], the
Crown now asks for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada under
section 1025  of the Criminal Code . It is of course necessary, before I
grant leave, that I should be satisfied that the judgment of the Court of
Appeal conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case.
If such a conflict cannot be found, it is not within my jurisdiction to grant
such a leave.

Counsel for the appellant have cited many
judgments and endeavoured to show that the ruling of the Court of Appeal on the
admissibility of the confessions, conflicts with the views adopted by other
courts of appeal. No judgments of other courts of appeal have been cited that
would conflict with the Court of Appeal of Ontario, on the point that there was
non‑direction and misdirection by the trial judge, in his charge to the
jury.

I am of opinion that this application must be
refused.

By the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal
the respondent has obtained a new trial on two grounds. Even

[Page 213]

if a conflict could be found on the question of
the admissibility of confessions, and this Court came to the conclusion that
the Court of Appeal were wrong, the respondent would still be entitled to a new
trial on the ground of misdirection. In any event, the appeal of the Crown is
bound to be dismissed, and it is not the function of this Court to give
advisory opinions on matters which cannot affect the final outcome of the
appeal.

Even if I had any doubts on the matter, they
would be cleared by the recent decision of this Court in the case of Ouvrard
v. Quebec Paper Box Co. Ltd.[3] where,
speaking for the Court, my Lord the Chief Justice said:

The appellant, in view of the fact that
there has been no dissent and that no conflict is alleged, is unable to ask
this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on this fundamental
question, and it means, therefore, that, even assuming there is a conflict on
the other points raised in the appeal and even if he should succeed in getting
this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on these other
points, the respondent would, nevertheless, remain acquitted. The appeal would
be devoid of any possible practical result and the Court would be asked only to
pass upon an academic question.

The application is dismissed.

Leave to appeal refused.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Indictment for attempted rape—Verdict
of assault causing bodily harm—Appellate court substituting conviction of
common assault—Appeal to this Court by the Crown—Conviction to be changed to
that of indecent assault—Conviction for “included” offences under section 951
Cr. C.—Sections 72, 292(c), 300, 1016 Cr. C.

A jury, upon an indictment for attempted
rape, returned a verdict of assault upon a female, causing actual bodily harm.
Upon an appeal by the accused, the Court of Appeal held that an indictment for
attempted rape did not include the offence for which he was found guilty, and
the Court then substituted a conviction for common assault. The Crown appealed
to this Court, asking that the substituted conviction be changed to that of
indecent assault.

Held that the
appeal should be dismissed.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kerwin, Kellock and Estey JJ.:—The offence of indecent assault may
be included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 Cr. C.; but, in this
case, it was not open to the appellate court, in view of the finding of the
jury, to substitute a conviction of indecent assault.

Per The Chief
Justice and Estey JJ.:—The jury, in finding the accused not guilty as charged
on the count of attempted rape, negatived the existence of the element of
indecency and in effect found the accused not guilty of indecent assault.
Therefore, the appellate court, so far as substituting one conviction for
another under section 1016 (2) Cr. C., had no other course open to it than to
substitute that of common assault.

Per Kerwin and
Kellock JJ.:—Section 1016 (2) Cr. C. requires it to appear to the Court of
Appeal on the actual finding that the jury “must” have been satisfied of facts
which proved the respondent guilty of indecent assault.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1947] O.R.
1) affirmed.

APPEAL by the Crown, upon leave to appeal
granted under section 1025 Cr. C., from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario[1],
allowing in part an appeal by the respondent from a conviction of having
committed an assault upon a female causing bodily harm and substituting a
conviction of common assault.

W.B. Common K.C. for the appellant.

Vera L. Parsons K.C. for the respondent.

[Page 235]

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Estey
J. was delivered by

ESTEY J.:—The accused was indicted for attempted
rape under section 300  of the Criminal Code . The learned trial judge instructed
the jury that included in the count of attempted rape were the other offences
of indecent assault, assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm (sec.
292 (c)), and common assault.

The jury returned a verdict of assault on a
female occasioning actual bodily harm.

Upon an appeal by the accused the appellate
court in Ontario held that an indictment for attempted rape did not include the
offence of assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm within the
meaning of section 951. The learned judges of that court then substituted under
sec. 1016(2) a verdict of common assault and imposed sentence of one year in
reformatory.

The accused does not appeal but the Crown
appeals to this court and asks that the substituted verdict of common assault
be changed to that of indecent assault.

Leave to appeal was granted to the Crown on the basis
that Rex v. Stewart[2] in
which the Appellate Division in Alberta held that the offence of indecent
assault is by virtue of the provisions of section 951 included in a count of
attempted rape and, therefore, is in conflict with the decision of the appellate
court of Ontario in this case.

The commission of the offence of rape includes
an act of indecency, as stated by my Lord the Chief Justice in Wright v. The
King[3]:

No doubt in a crime such as the one (rape)
under consideration, the initial step might be stated to be an indecent
assault, followed by the subsequent step which might be described as an attempt
to rape * * * 

Section 72  of the Criminal Code  defines an
attempt:

Every one who, having an intent to commit
an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of accomplishing his object,
is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence intended whether under the
circumstances it was possible to commit such offence or not.

This section requires that one to be guilty of
an attempt must intend to commit the completed offence and to have done some
act toward the accomplishment of that

[Page 236]

objective. That act must be beyond preparation
and go so far toward the commission of the completed offence that but for some
intervention he is prevented or desists from the completion thereof.

Acts remotely leading towards the
commission of the offence are not to be considered as attempts to commit it but
acts immediately connected with it are. Parke B. in Reg. v. Eagleton[4], quoted by Lord Reading C.J. in Rex v. Robinson[5].

It is the existence of both the intent and the
act in such a relationship that the former may be regarded as the cause of the
latter. The intent unaccompanied by the act does not constitute a criminal
offence.

In the early case of Rex v. Scofield[6], Lord Mansfield stated at p. 403:

So long as an act rests in bare intention,
it is not punishable by our laws: but immediately when an act is done, the law
judges, not only of the act done, but of the intent with which it is done; and,
if it is coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent, though the act itself
would otherwise have been innocent, the intent being criminal, the act becomes
criminal and punishable.

This case is commented upon in Broom’s Legal
Maxims, 6th Ed. p. 305:

It is a rule, laid down by Lord Mansfield,
and which has been said to comprise all the principles of previous decisions
upon this subject, that so long as an act rests in bare intention, it is not
punishable by our laws; but when an act is done, the law judges not only of the
act itself, but of the intent with which it was done; and if the act be coupled
with an unlawful and malicious intent, though in itself the act would otherwise
have been innocent, yet, the intent being criminal, the act likewise becomes
criminal and punishable.

It appears from the foregoing that the intent
may determine the criminal quality of the act. There is present in the offence
of rape the intent to commit an indecent act. The same intent is required in
the offence of attempted rape. In the latter that intent may be found from the
nature of the act or from the conduct of the accused immediately associated
with the commission of that act or indeed both. If such an intent be not
present the offence of attempted rape is not committed. The act cannot be
dissociated from the intent as evidence which caused the accused to do such
act.

[Page 237]

In Rex v. Louie Chong[7], the magistrate found the accused guilty of
indecent assault and stated a case for the opinion of the appellate division in
Ontario as to whether he was justified in finding the accused guilty of
indecent assault, where the accused in taking hold of the girl did so in a
manner that did not import indecency. At the same time, however, he offered her
money to go with him for an immoral purpose. The judgment of the court written
by Middleton J. affirmed the magistrate’s conviction. His Lordship in
delivering the judgment stated:

It appears to me that an act in itself
ambiguous may be interpreted by the surrounding circumstances and by words
spoken at the time the act is committed * * *. It is in each
case a question of fact whether the thing which was done, in the circumstances
in which it was done, was done indecently. If it was, an indecent assault has
been committed.

His spoken words which were part of his conduct
evidenced the intention of the accused and determined the criminal quality of
his act.

It would, therefore, appear that a count
charging an attempt to commit rape would include the offence of indecent
assault under section 951.

Though the offence of indecent assault is
included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 it was not in this
case, because of the finding of the jury, open to the appellate court to
substitute a verdict of indecent assault. Section 951 provides that the

accused may be convicted of any offence so
included which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not
proved * * * 

The learned trial judge explained to the jury
the ingredients essential to find the accused guilty upon one or other of the
four counts. Those of attempted rape and indecent assault require a finding of
indecency, while that of actual bodily harm to a female does not. The jury in
finding the accused not guilty as charged on the count of attempted rape
negatived the existence of the element of indecency and, therefore, in effect
found the accused not guilty of indecent assault.

Where an indictment contained three counts:1
that the accused did unlawfully kill, under section 268; (2) grievous bodily
harm, sec. 284; and (3) wanton or furious

[Page 238]

driving, sec. 285, the jury found the accused
guilty of wanton or furious driving. Chief Justice Anglin stated at p. 47:

In a case such as that at bar, that the
jury had found that neither the whole offence charged in count No. 1 nor the
whole offence charged in count No. 2 had been proved, is an intendment which we
must make in support of the verdict.

And at p. 48:

It was within the province of the jury to
find that the offence charged in the third count was satisfactorily proven, but
that, for reasons which we can only surmise and as to the validity or the
adequacy of which we are not at liberty to inquire some essential element of
each of the offences charged in the first and second counts respectively was,
in their view, not established beyond reasonable doubt. Barton v. The King[8].

The jury in finding the accused guilty of
assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a female negatived the existence of
the element of indecency essential to the finding of a verdict of indecent
assault. Therefore, the appellate court could not conclude “that the
jury * * * must have been satisfied of the facts which
proved him guilty of” indecent assault as required by section 1016(2) before it
can substitute a verdict of guilty of that other offence. Rex v. Hayes and
Pallante[9]; Rex
v. Collins[10].

In a case where the accused was found guilty of
murder this court so satisfied was in a position to and did reduce the verdict
to one of manslaughter. At p. 350 Chief Justice Duff:

The finding makes it clear that the jury
must have been satisfied of the facts necessary to constitute manslaughter, and
we are, consequently, of opinion that the Court of Appeal would have authority
under s. 1016 to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict of the
jury and to pronounce sentence upon the prisoner. Rex v. Hopper[11]; Manchuk v. The King[12].

The learned judges in the appellate court,
because of the verdict of the jury, so far as substituting one verdict for
another under section 1016(2), had no other course open to them than to
substitute that of common assault.

The appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 239]

The judgment of Kerwin and Kellock J.J. was
delivered by

KELLOCK J.:—This is an appeal by the Attorney
General of Ontario, pursuant to leave granted under section 1025 (1)  of the
Criminal Code , from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated
December 13, 1946.

The present respondent was charged with
attempted rape and on his trial before Schroeder J. and a jury was convicted of
“assault upon a female occasioning actual bodily harm”. The learned trial judge
had charged the jury that they might convict as charged, or of indecent
assault, or assault upon a female occasioning actual bodily harm or common
assault or not guilty.

The respondent appealed in writing to the Court
of Appeal and on the hearing of the appeal the court raised the question
whether it was competent for the jury to return the verdict they had returned.
It was held that such a verdict was not open to the jury and the court
substituted a conviction of common assault, being of opinion that the jury by
their verdict, in view of the learned judge’s charge, had negatived indecent
assault. Roach J.A., who delivered the judgment of the court, expressed
disagreement with the decision of the appellate division of Alberta in Rex v.
Stewart[13], by
which it was held that, on a charge of attempting to have carnal knowledge of a
girl under the age of fourteen, the accused might be convicted of indecent
assault, under section 95113.

The Attorney General now appeals on the ground
that the Court of Appeal was in error in holding that indecent assault is not
an included offence in a charge of attempted rape. He asks that a conviction
for indecent assault be substituted. We are not called upon otherwise to
consider the judgment in appeal. Counsel for the respondent agrees with the
submission of the appellant that the Court of Appeal was in error in the view
taken with respect to indecent assault being included in the charge of the
indictment here in question.

If common assault be an included offence in a
charge of attempted rape as held by the Court of Appeal, and there can be no
question but that such an assault would

[Page 240]

be an act within section 72 , then such an act,
though in itself ambiguous, may, interpreted by the surrounding circumstances,
including words spoken at the time, amount to indecent assault; Rex v. Louie
Chong[14]. It is
not necessary that the act constituting the assault be in itself indecent in
its nature. If the assault, coupled with the intention required by section 72,
is of such a nature as to constitute an attempt within the rule as laid down in
Rex v. Robinson[15], such
assault must necessarily be indecent; Rex v. Louie Chong14.
In other words, the crime of attempted rape progresses from assault through
indecent assault to the complete crime. If the facts of the suppositious case
referred to by Roach J.A. amount to the offence of attempted rape, the assault
itself necessarily becomes indecent. This would appear to have been the view of
the majority in Wright v. The King[16].

However, I agree with the Court of Appeal in the
view that it was not open to that court, in view of the learned trial judge’s
charge and the verdict of the jury, to substitute a conviction for indecent
assault. Section 101615 requires it to appear to the Court of Appeal
on the actual finding that the jury “must” have been satisfied of facts which
proved the respondent guilty of indecent asault. The highest that Mr. Common
puts his argument, and properly so, is that:

It is quite possible that the jury might be
under the erroneous impression that a conviction for assault occasioning actual
bodily harm on a female was more serious than that of indecent assault.

That is not sufficient. I do not think that the
Court of Appeal were required, in the circumstances here present, to come to
the conclusion the statute requires.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

TASCHEREAU J.:—I am of opinion that this appeal
should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Offence of indecent
assault—Judge sitting without a jury—Self-misdirection—Judge’s report—No
finding as to statements by complainant or accused—Acquittal based on evidence
of a witness—Reversal of acquittal by court of appeal—New
trial—Evidence—Witnesses—Credibility of—Application by court of appeal of
section 1014(2) Cr. C.—“No substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice”—Reasonable doubt as to guilt of accused—Whether verdict be the same if
proper self-direction by trial judge—Sections 1013(4), 1013(5) and 1014(2)
Cr. C.

The appellant was charged with the offence of
indecent assault upon C, alleged to have taken place at a dental clinic while C
was under examination. Complete discrepancy is disclosed between the testimony
of the complainant and that of the accused. A witness, B, working in the
clinic, gave evidence that he passed the open door of the room upon two
occasions, without stating the time and the intervals of time between them, and
that he had noticed that the accused was then writing at a table. The
magistrate acquitted the accused, and, in his judgment, said that the case was
one to be decided entirely on the credibility of the witnesses, that there
should be a conviction or a dismissal of the charge whether the evidence of the
complainant or that of the accused was accepted; and he added that, if the

[Page 269]

evidence of B was accepted, “there must be a
dismissal of the charge,” stating later that he was “bound in law to accept his
evidence”. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the Crown and directed
that the accused be retried upon the same charge. Upon an appeal by the accused
to this Court,

Held that the
judgment appealed from should be affirmed.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kellock and Estey JJ.:—The evidence of B does not go so far as to
contradict the evidence of the complainant nor corroborate the evidence of the
accused upon the points that are material to the determination of the issue;
and, even if B’s evidence was believed, it was still necessary for the
magistrate to consider all the evidence and the credibility and the weight to
be given to the statements made by the respective witnesses. The magistrate has
not considered the evidence upon any such basis, but rather has founded his
decision upon a misdirection that if B’s evidence was believed “there must be a
dismissal.” Comments as to the issue of credibility of witnesses.

Per Kerwin
J.:—The proposition upon which the magistrate proceeded cannot be supported: he
does not state whether he believed the evidence of the complainant or of the
accused, and, in proceeding to discuss the evidence of B apart from that of the
complainant and accused, he failed to perform the responsibility resting upon
him.

The appellant also contended that, under s.
1014(2) Cr. C, the Court of Appeal should have dismissed the appeal by the
Crown, as “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually
occurred”.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kellock and Estey JJ.:—The appellate court, when there has been no
decision arrived at upon a consideration of the evidence, particularly in a
case where the evidence is so restricted to a few facts and where any
adjudication must depend so largely upon the credibility and the weight to be
given to the evidence of the respective parties, is unable to conclude that,
under s. 1014(2) Cr. C., “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
actually occurred.”

Per Kerwin
J.:—The appellant’s claim should be dismissed. Effect must be given to the will
of Parliament in permitting appeals by the Crown from acquittals (s. 1013(4)
Cr. C.) and to the provisions of s. 1014(2) Cr. C. by which, according to s.
1013(5) Cr. C., the powers of a court of appeal are, mutatis mutandis, to
be similar to the powers given by the former. Applying those provisions to this
case, the proper rule to be followed by the Court of Appeal was that the onus
was on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily
have been the same if the magistrate had properly directed himself. But,
without in any way weakening the salutary rule that an accused is entitled to
the benefit of a doubt as to his guilt, when a court of appeal has to apply the
provisions of s. 1014(2) Cr. C., it must be concluded in the present case that
the magistrate would not necessarily have acquitted the appellant if he had
given himself the proper direction.

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing an appeal by the Attorney General for
Ontario against the acquittal by Magistrate James B. Garvin on a charge of
indecent assault and directing that the accused be retried upon the same
charge.

G. Arthur Martin K.C. for the appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kellock
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

ESTEY J.—The magistrate found the accused not
guilty of the offence of indecent assault. The facts material to the offence
were deposed to by the complainant and contradicted by the accused. The
complainant stated that the offence took place at a dental clinic while she was
under an examination by the accused, a qualified dentist in the Dental Corps. A
witness Black gave evidence that he was at the time working in the same clinic
and that upon two occasions he passed the room where he saw the complainant and
the accused. The door of the room was open and upon each occasion he noticed
that the accused was writing at a table. Just when or at what intervals of time
he passed the room is not disclosed, nor does the evidence disclose either the
plan or size of the clinic.

At the conclusion of the hearing the magistrate
reserved judgment and later acquitted the accused, his judgment reading in part
as follows:

The case is one that must be decided
entirely on the credibility of the witnesses. If the evidence of the
complainant is accepted, there must be a conviction. On the other hand, if the
evidence of the accused is accepted, there must be a dismissal of the charge.
Also, in my judgment, if the evidence of the witness Black is accepted, there
must be a dismissal.

An examination of the evidence of the witness
Black, while relevant in determining the credibility of both the complainant
and the accused, is upon the main issue restricted to his observations upon two
occasions as he passed the door. It does not go so far as to contradict the
evidence of the complainant nor corroborate the evidence of the accused upon
the points that are material

[Page 271]

to the determination of the issue. If therefore
Black’s evidence was believed, it was still necessary for the magistrate to
consider all of the evidence, the credibility and the weight to be given to the
statements made by the respective witnesses and to determine whether the
accused was guilty or not guilty.

It is clear that the magistrate has not
considered the evidence upon any such basis but rather has founded his decision
upon a misdirection that if Black’s evidence was believed “there must be a
dismissal.”

The appellate court, when there has been no
decision arrived at upon a consideration of the evidence, particularly in a
case where the evidence is so restricted to a few facts and where any
adjudication must depend so largely upon the credibility and the weight to be
given to the evidence of the respective parties, is unable to conclude that
under section 1014(2) Cr. C. “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has actually occurred.”

It would appear also that the magistrate
misdirected himself relative to the determination of Black’s credibility. He
stated:

In my judgment the evidence of Black
substantially meets all the above tests and I feel that I am bound in law to
accept his evidence.

He based his statement upon Rex v. Covert[1]. In that case the accused was charged that
he did unlawfully keep intoxicating liquor in a place other than a dwelling
house. The prosecution adduced evidence that the accused had upon his premises
a bar or a counter and was in possession of intoxicating liquor and then relied
upon the statutory provision that placed upon the accused the burden of proving
that he had not committed the offence. The accused in giving his evidence gave
an explanation which, if believed, discharged the statutory burden placed upon
him and entitled him to an acquittal. Notwithstanding this and apparently
without indicating a reason there for the magistrate found the accused guilty.
Mr. Justice Beck, with whom the majority of the court concurred, condemned
the decision which he described as made “arbitrarily and in disregard of the
evidence.” When the learned judge stated: “It cannot be said without limitation
that a judge

[Page 272]

can refuse to accept evidence,” he no doubt had
in mind the failure on the part of the magistrate to act judicially rather than
arbitrarily. Certainly the tests he suggests do not deprive the magistrate of
any of his powers but would rather seem to emphasize that he discharge his duty
and not only determine the question of credibility but indicate that he has
done so.

The issue of credibility is one of fact and
cannot be determined by following a set of rules that it is suggested have the
force of law and, in so far as the language of Mr. Justice Beck may be so
construed, it cannot be supported upon the authorities. Anglin J. (later Chief
Justice) in speaking of credibility stated:

by that I understand not merely the
appreciation of the witnesses’ desire to be truthful but also of their
opportunities of knowledge and powers of observation, judgment and memory—in a
word, the trustworthiness of their testimony, which may have depended very
largely on their demeanour in the witness box and their manner in giving
evidence. Reymond v. Township of Bosanquet[2].

The foregoing is a general statement and does
not purport to be exhaustive. Eminent judges have from time to time indicated
certain guides that have been of the greatest assistance, but so far as I have
been able to find there has never been an effort made to indicate all the
possible factors that might enter into the determination. It is a matter in
which so many human characteristics, both the strong and the weak, must be
taken into consideration. The general integrity and intelligence of the witness,
his powers to observe, his capacity to remember and his accuracy in statement
are important. It is also important to determine whether he is honestly
endeavouring to tell the truth, whether he is sincere and frank or whether he
is biassed, reticent and evasive. All these questions and others may be
answered from the observation of the witness’ general conduct and demeanour in
determining the question of credibility.

The judgment of the appellate court directing a
new trial should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed.

KERWIN J.—The appellant was acquitted by a
magistrate of a charge that he did unlawfully indecently assault one Emily
Cumming, a female, contrary to section 292

[Page 273]

of the Criminal Code . The Attorney General of
Ontario appealed to the Court of Appeal for that province against the acquittal
on the grounds that the magistrate misdirected himself in stating that he was
bound in law to accept the evidence of one Black, a witness at the trial, and
that the magistrate was wrong in coming to the conclusion that he could
exercise no discretion in weighing the credibility of that evidence. The Court
of Appeal allowed the appeal and directed that the accused be retried upon the
same charge.

In giving judgment, the magistrate said:

The case is one that must be decided
entirely on the credibility of the witnesses. If the evidence of the
complainant is accepted, there must be a conviction. On the other hand, if the
evidence of the accused is accepted, there must be a dismissal of the charge.
Also, in my judgment, if the evidence of the witness Black is accepted, there
must be a dismissal.

After stating that Black was to some extent an
independent witness and that if his evidence was to be accepted, he, the
magistrate, did not see how there could be a conviction, he continued:

I think the evidence of Black should be
examined having regard to the principle of law laid down in Rex v. Covert[3].

This was a judgment of Beck J. on behalf of the
majority in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and the
magistrate quoted therefrom the following paragraphs:

We are bound to presume the accused was
innocent, until proved guilty; he gave all the available evidence and that
evidence, if true, explained away the inference or presumption against him.

It will be objected, of course, that the
magistrate may have disbelieved entirely the evidence on behalf of the accused,
and that it was open to him to do so; but in my opinion it cannot be said
without limitation that a judge can refuse to accept evidence. I think he
cannot, if the following conditions are fulfilled:

(1) That the statements of the witness are
not in themselves improbable or unreasonable;

(2) That there is no contradiction of them;

(3) That the credibility of the witness has
not been attacked by evidence against his character;

(4) That nothing appears in the course of
his evidence or of the evidence of any other witness tending to throw discredit
upon him; and

(5) That there is nothing in his demeanour
while in Court during the trial to suggest untruthfulness.

[Page 274]

To permit a trial judge to refuse to accept
evidence given under all these conditions would be to permit him to determine
the dispute arbitrarily and in disregard of the evidence, which is surely not
the spirit of our system of jurisprudence.

The Covert case[4] arose in connection with an application by
way of certiorari to quash a summary conviction under the Liquor Act of
Alberta and was decided before the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Rex
v. Nat Bell Liquors Limited[5]. There
a number of judgments in various courts were overruled and it was decided that
a conviction by a magistrate for a non‑indictable offence could not be
quashed on certiorari on the ground that the depositions show that there
was no evidence to support the conviction. The Covert case4
is mentioned at page 141 of the report.

What the Court of Appeal had before it in the
present case was an appeal and the proposition upon which the magistrate
proceeded cannot be supported. Nowhere does he say whether he believed the
evidence of the complainant or of the accused, and to proceed to discuss the
evidence of Black apart from that of the complainant and accused is really to
shirk the responsibility resting upon him. Unless, therefore, there is some
other valid ground of attack, the order of the Court of Appeal ordering a new
trial cannot be impugned.

It was contended, however, that, under
subsection 2  of section 1014  of the Criminal Code , the Court of
Appeal should have dismissed the appeal. This subsection reads:

2. The court may also dismiss the appeal
if, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that on any of the grounds above
mentioned the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is also of
opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually
occurred.

We do not know if the point was argued nor,
since no written reasons were delivered, whether it was considered, in the
Court of Appeal. The test in applying subsection 2 in the case of an
appeal by an accused from a conviction is well known and was reiterated in this
Court in Schmidt v. The King[6].
But it is said that on an appeal by an Attorney General from an acquittal a
different rule is to be followed and reliance is placed upon two decisions in

[Page 275]

the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, Rex v. Bourgeois[7], and Rex v. Probe[8]. The effect of these decisions is that upon
an appeal by an Attorney General from an acquittal, even if substantial error
has been shown, the Court should not grant a new trial where doubt could be
entertained by the tribunal of fact as to the guilt of the accused. This
conclusion was based upon a consideration of the rule that the accused is
entitled to the benefit of a doubt as to his guilt. While not referred to on
the argument of this appeal, it was decided in Rex v. O’Leary[9], by the British Columbia Court of Appeal,
that when the appellate court was satisfied from the report of the magistrate
that he would have convicted in the particular case without corroboration of an
accomplice, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had actually
occurred because, even if the trial judge had not misdirected himself, he must
have reached the same conclusion as he actually did.

The first two cases, of course, go much further
than the last, and the reasoning upon which they proceeded cannot be justified.
The dissenting opinion of Martin J., now Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, in the
first case is to be preferred. As he points out, Chief Justice Anglin, speaking
for this Court in Belyea v. The King[10], refers to subsection 5  of
section 1013  of the Criminal Code  as enacted in 1930 by which the
procedure upon an appeal by an Attorney General and the powers of the Court of
Appeal shall mutatis mutandis, and so far as the same are applicable to
appeals upon a question of law alone, be similar to the procedure prescribed
and the powers given by sections 1012  to 1021  Cr. C. inclusive. Chief
Justice Anglin stated

that the effect of the words “mutatis
mutandis” is that clause (a) (of subsection 3 of
section 1014  Cr. C.) must be made to read, on an appeal (by an Attorney
General) being allowed, to

(a) quash the acquittal and
direct a judgment and verdict of conviction to be entered.

That in fact was what was done in the Belyea case10.

The point with which we are concerned under
subsection 2  of section 1014  Cr. C. was apparently not argued in

[Page 276]

Pitre v. The
King[11], so
that the remarks at the end of the judgment of Smith J. may properly be
considered as obiter dicta but to give to this subsection the
meaning ascribed in the judgments in Saskatchewan where a court of appeal has
before it an appeal by the Attorney General from a conviction would be to
permit an appellate court to encroach upon the field of the tribunal of fact.
Without in any way weakening the salutary rule that an accused is entitled to
the benefit of a doubt as to his guilt, effect must be given to the will of
Parliament in permitting appeals from acquittals and to the provisions of
subsection 2  of section 1014  Cr. C. by which, according to the terms
of subsection 5  of section 1013  Cr. C., the powers of a court of
appeal are mutatis mutandis and so far as the same are applicable to
appeals upon a question of law alone, to be similar to the powers given by the
former. Applying those provisions to the present case, the proper rule to be
followed by the Court of Appeal was that the onus was on the Crown to satisfy
the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the
magistrate had properly directed himself. No doubt there will be circumstances
such as arose in Rex v. O’Leary[12]
where not only that cannot be shown but the opposite is true, but that
situation does not arise here. In the present case it must be concluded that
the magistrate would not necessarily have acquitted the appellant if he had given
himself the proper direction.

The appeal should be dismissed.

TASCHEREAU J.:—I am of opinion that this appeal
should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal Law—Murder—Evidence—Crown witness
declared adverse—Effect of cross-examination by Crown counsel on previous
statement made police—Effect of cross-examination by Defence counsel on sketch
attached to said statement—Whether admissible to test credibility, or evidence
of content—Canada Evidence Act—Where witness declared adverse ss. 9 and 10 to be read together to make
applicable proviso to s. 10—But proviso does not make that evidence which would
not otherwise be evidence—S. 1014 of
the Criminal Code—Charge to jury—Misdirection—New Trial.

The appeal was from the judgment of the Court
of Appeal for Manitoba (1947) 55 Man. R. 1, dismissing (Adamson J. and Donovan
J. dissenting) appellant’s appeal from his conviction on a charge of murder. At
the trial Helen Elizabeth Berard, a witness for the Crown, gave evidence
contradictory to statements made previously by her to the police and at the
inquest of the deceased. On motion of Crown counsel the trial judge declared
her an adverse witness and Crown counsel thereupon cross-examined her on a
previous statement, without making it an exhibit, which consisted of five pages
written by the witness and an extra page on which appeared a sketch drawn by
her showing the back of the head of a taxi driver to have a bald spot. (The
taxi driver, with whose murder the accused was charged, did not have a bald
spot.) The five pages and the sketch were not fastened together at the time of
their inception. Counsel for the accused in cross-examining the witness showed
her the sketch, which at the preliminary inquiry had been attached to the
sheets containing the writing, but which he at the trial removed and handed to
the witness. The trial judge ruled that the entire statement including the
sketch should go in as an exhibit (14) filed
by the defence. In charging the jury the trial judge said it was their duty
keeping in mind his charge as to reasonable doubt, to establish if possible in
which of the conflicting statements of the witness lay the germ of truth. The
accused did not testify nor were any witnesses called on his behalf.

Held: The
judgment appealed from and the conviction should be set aside and a new trial
directed.

Per the Chief
Justice and Kerwin, Taschereau and Estey JJ.: The prior self-contradictory
statements of Crown witness Helen Elizabeth Berard, both sworn and unsworn, had
no probative or evidential value as against the accused, and were not evidence
of their content and could be used only to impeach the credit of the witness
Berard, even though defence counsel cross-examined on them. The learned trial
judge erred in going on the assumption that such prior self-contradictory
statements were evidence of their content and inviting the jury to find “what
germ of truth” there was in them.

[Page 532]

The said prior self-contradictory statements
were not evidence of their content and the jury should have been so instructed,
and not having been so instructed, it was not possible to say with confidence
that without them the jury would have found a verdict of guilty.

There was an error at the trial for the
reasons specified above in connection with exhibit 14, and it could not be said that there was no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice, within section 1014
of the Criminal Code. The sketch and the written document being
one document from the commencement, the effect of what Crown counsel had done
was to make available the whole of it so that counsel for the accused became
entitled to refer to the sketch, not mentioned by Counsel for the Crown; while
the action of counsel for the accused had the effect of making the writing, as
well as the sketch, an exhibit; but neither one could serve as evidence against
the accused except, in so far as the witness adopted them as part of her
testimony, and did not take the exhibit out of the category of something merely
going to the credibility of the witness and raise it to the status of something
that as against the accused was to be taken as evidence of the truth contained
in the writing.

Assuming that where a witness is declared
adverse by the trial judge, sections 9 and
10 of the Canada Evidence Act should
be read together so as to make applicable the last part of the proviso in
subsection 1 of section 10:—

“and that the judge, at any time during the
trial may require the production of the writing for his inspection, and
thereupon make such use of it for the purposes of the trial as he thinks fit,”
this does not mean that the trial judge may make that evidence which would not
otherwise be evidence. Target Tillson Birch (1924)
18 Cr. A.R. 26 at 28, 29 and the trial judge erred in
directing the jury that they could treat the written part of exhibit 14 as evidence of the truth of what is
therein stated Rex. v. Dibble (1908)
1 Cr. A.R. 155, A. White (1922) 17 Cr. A. R. 59, Rex v. Francis & Barber [1929] 3 D.L.R. 593. The decision in John Williams (1913) 8 Cr. A. R. 133
distinguished. There was nothing in the evidence given by the witness
Berard at the preliminary inquiry as read into the record of the trial to show
that she was a self-confessed perjurer. Douglas Walter Atkinson (1934) 24 Cr. A.R. 144 distinguished. Rex v. Kadeshevitz
[1934] O.R. 213; 61 C.C.C. 193 and Rex v. Ferguson 83 C.C.C. 23 at
25 referred to.

Per Rand J.:
The effect of counsel for the accused offering in evidence the sketch made by
the witness Berard and cross-examining her thereon, was to introduce in
evidence the written statement which accompanied the sketch and simply
completed the evidence of the statement. It did not extend the statement’s
relevancy beyond credibility. The trial judge erred in holding that counsel for
the accused, by putting the sketch in evidence, must be taken to have
introduced the statement itself as substantive evidence on behalf of the
accused, and in charging the jury that the incriminating facts contained in the
statement were to be treated as having general testimonial character from
which, and the rest of the evidence, the jury was to extract the truth. An
error in such a vital matter cannot be held to have been unquestionably
overborne by the rest of the case presented.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba (1) dismissing (Adamson J. and Donovan J. dissenting) the
appellant’s ‘appeal from his conviction, at trial before Major J., and a jury,
on a charge of murder.

H. Walsh for the appellant.

A. A. Moffat K.C. and J. H. Stitt for the respondent.

The judgment of The Chief Justice and of Kerwin,
Taschereau and Estey JJ. was delivered by

Kerwin J.:—This appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba [1] affirming the appellant’s
conviction on a charge of murder is based upon dissents by Adamson J. and
Donovan J. The former would have set aside the conviction and ordered a new
trial on the following grounds:—

1. That the prior self-contradictory statements of Crown witness Helen
Elizabeth Berard, both sworn and unsworn (viz. exhibits 12, 13 and 14 and
the inquest evidence), had no probative or evidential value as against the
accused, and were not evidence of their content and could be used only to
impeach the credit of the witness Helen Elizabeth Berard, even though defence
counsel cross-examined on them.

2. The learned Trial Judge erred in going on the assumption that such
prior self-contradictory statements were evidence of their content and inviting
the jury to find “what germ of truth” there was in them.

3. That the said prior self-contradictory
statements were not evidence of their content and the jury should have been so
instructed, and not having been so instructed it was not possible to say with
confidence that without them the jury would have found a verdict of guilty;

Donovan J. dissented on these grounds in
substance, and also on other grounds but, furthermore, came to the conclusion
that the accused should be acquitted. I cannot agree that there should be an
acquittal but since, in my view, there was error at the trial for the reasons
specified above in connection with exhibit 14, and I am unable to say there was
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice within section 1014 of the
Criminal Code, it follows that there should be a new trial, and I therefore
refrain from discussing the evidence at length or the other grounds of dissent
mentioned by Donovan J., with one exception.

Exhibit 14 consists of five pages of a statement
written by the witness Berard and an extra sheet on which appears a sketch
drawn by her showing the back of the head of

[Page 534]

a taxi driver to have a bald spot. The taxi
driver, with whose murder the accused was charged, did not have a bald spot. I
take it from the evidence, as did also the Chief Justice of Manitoba, that the
five pages containing the written statement of Berard, and the sketch, really
formed one document from their very inception, although the various sheets were
not fastened together at that time.

At the trial Berard, called as a witness by the
Crown, was declared adverse by the trial judge under section 9 of the Canada
Evidence Act and by leave of the judge, Crown counsel cross-examined her as
to her previous written statement in exhibit 14 without making it an exhibit.
Berard admitted having made this statement but said it had been written under
fear of the police and denied the important part of it in which she placed the
accused with her in the taxi at the time of the slaying. Counsel for the
accused later showed her the sketch, which at the preliminary inquiry had been
attached to the sheets containing the writing but which counsel for the accused
at the trial removed and handed to the witness separately. This sketch and the
written statement being one document from the commencement, the effect of what
Crown counsel had done was to make available the whole of it so that counsel
for the accused became entitled to refer to the sketch, not mentioned by
counsel for the Crown, as possibly affecting the written part. Counsel for the
accused put in the sketch as an exhibit and it is contended for the Crown that
this made the writing an exhibit and that what was narrated therein was
evidence of the truth thereof. While the action of counsel for the accused had
the effect of making the writing as well as the sketch an exihibit, neither one
could serve as evidence against the accused except, of course, in so far as the
witness adopted them as part of her testimony at the trial.

The fact that the sketch was put in as an
exhibit, and therefore the writing, does not take the exhibit out of the
category of something merely going to the credibility of the witness and raise
it to the status of something that as against the accused is to be taken as
evidence of the truth of the statements contained in the writing. A contrary
proposition would be entirely foreign to our criminal law.

[Page 535]

Assuming that where a witness for the Crown is
declared adverse by the trial judge, sections 9 and 10 of the Canada
Evidence Act should be read together so as to make applicable the last part
of the proviso in subsection 1 of section 10:—

and that the judge, at any time during the
trial may require the production of the writing for his inspection, and thereupon
make such use of it for the purposes of the trial as he thinks fit,

this does not mean that the trial judge in
making “such use of it for the purposes of the trial as he thinks fit” may make
that evidence which would otherwise not be evidence. This would appear to be so
in principle and was the view of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Target
Tillson Birch, [2].

The trial judge directed the jury that they
could treat the written part of Exhibit 14 as evidence of the truth of what is
therein stated. That this was wrong is made plain by all the text-books and
such cases as Rex v. Dibble, [3],
A. White [4],
Rex v. Francis & Barber, [5].
The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England in John Williams [6], must be
read with care. Apparently a witness gave the same testimony at the trial as on
a previous occasion except that she gave a different date for certain important
occurrences and it was held that the jury might consider that part of the
previous testimony to which she agreed at the trial. There is nothing in this
case that conflicts with the general proposition.

It was argued that on the authority of Leonard
Harris [7],
and Douglas Walter Atkinson [8],
the jury should have been warned that the evidence of Berard was of no value.
In the Atkinson case 8, a witness was stated by the Lord Chief
Justice, at page 125, to be not only an accomplice in connection with charges
against the accused of perjury and subornation of perjury but also herself a
perjurer. That precise point does not arise here because there is nothing in
the evidence given by Berard at the preliminary inquiry as read into the record
of the trial to show that she was a self-confessed perjurer. So far as her
testimony at the trial was shown to be contradictory to

[Page 536]

the written statement in Exhibit 14, certain
expressions in the Leonard Harris case do afford a basis for the argument of
counsel for the present appellant. While it must be borne in mind that the
appeal in that case was dismissed the Lord Chief Justice is reported to have
said at page 149:—

The learned judge directed the jury in the
proper way, namely, that the effect of the previous statement taken together
with the sworn statement was to render the girl a negligible witness and that
the jury must consider whether the case was otherwise and by others made out.

As to this, I agree with Riddell J., in Rex v.
Kadeshevitz 9, that that cannot be taken to
correctly set forth the Jaw. That is not to say that there may not be cases
where it is advisable for a trial judge to point out a weakness in the Crown’s
case, particularly if it arises from the bad record of the principal Crown
witness. It was so put, and not as a principle of law, by Chief Justice
Robertson, speaking for the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in Rex v. Ferguson
10.

Because the trial judge in this case instructed
the jury that Berard’s statement in exhibit 14 might be taken as evidence of
the truth of what was therein stated, the judgment appealed from and the
conviction should be set aside and a new trial directed.

Rand J.:—This is an appeal from a conviction for murder. In the Court of
Appeal there were dissents on a number of questions of law, but I do not find
it necessary to deal with more than one.

The leading witness for the prosecution was, in
the course of her testimony, declared to be hostile, and the Crown was
permitted to cross-examine her in relation to a previous statement in writing
she had of her own volition prepared and handed to the police. In that she
purported to give an account of the murder of the driver of a taxi in which she
and the accused had been riding, but out of which she had got or was getting
when the fatal act was committed, an account which directly connected the
accused with that act. Her evidence in court, bringing their movements generally
to the scene of the death 

[Page 537]

consistently with the statement, diverged from
it in representing the taxi carrying the accused to have left the scene and in
introducing a new taxi in which the killing took place, of which she was,
virtually, a witness. The statement signed by her was produced in court and the
examination on it proceeded by reading it passage by passage to her, the whole
of which the witness admitted having made. The document itself was not further
offered in evidence or otherwise read to the jury. On cross-examination,
counsel offered in evidence a sketch made by her representing the scene of her
movements in the vicinity of the crime. This sketch, showing the roads with
streetcar tracks along which the taxi had passed and she had afterwards fled,
contained also a drawing of the back of a man’s head with a bald spot on it
which the witness stated to represent the head of the driver of the taxi in
which she and the accused had been passengers. There was evidence that the
slain man had no such baldness. It later appeared that the sketch had
accompanied the statement which it was intended by the witness to illustrate
when given by her to the police. The Crown thereupon took the position that by
putting the sketch in evidence, counsel must be taken also to have introduced
the statement itself as substantive evidence on behalf of the accused. The
trial judge so held, and in the charge (and as well in the address of Crown
counsel) the incriminating facts contained in the statement were treated as
having general testimonial character, from which and the rest of the evidence
the jury was to extract the truth.

That such statements generally are limited to
credibility and cannot be used as evidence of the truth of the facts to which
they relate, is well established: Rex v. Dibble 11, Rex
v. Harris 12, Rex v. Francis &
Barber 13. It is quite true that it may be
difficult to dissociate the matters of such statements from the facts brought
before the jury by the witness and to nullify the influence they may have on
the minds of the jurors in dealing with the evidence as a whole; but anything
short of this would expose a

[Page 538]

person to a fabricated account of events, too
dangerous to risk. But the whole field of cross-examination, in the discretion
of the court, is opened and the matters of the statement can thus be brought
within the test of the testimonial response of the witness. This might be taken
as a reason for leaving all the facts, including the statement, to the
consideration of the jury, but the long experience of the courts is against it.

It is argued that the case of Rex v. Harris
14,
in which a similar question arose has been disregarded in Rex v. Kadeshevitz
15;
but what was there dissented from was the apparent language of Hewart, L.C.J.
that in the presence of such a contradiction the sworn testimony in court of
the witness must be treated as wholly nullified. The Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the testimony might be considered by the jury notwithstanding the
contradiction; but it accepted the view that the contradictory statements
themselves could not be treated as substantive evidence, available for all
purposes.

The question here, then, is whether, in the
circumstances, the effect of the course taken by counsel for the accused has
been to enlarge the relevancy of the statement. As the whole of it was read in
court in the hearing of the jury and as the sketch was an explanatory part of
it, the introduction of the latter by the defence simply completed the evidence
of the statement that had been brought out. It was counsel’s right to have the
entire statement so presented without extending its relevancy beyond
credibility. The addition to the record of the statement itself brought nothing
new to the proceedings, and must be considered in any view to be limited
likewise to its original purpose.

It is urged by Mr. Moffatt that notwithstanding
this impropriety, the remaining evidence as a whole was of such weight as to
enable us to say that the jury must, under proper directions and acting
judicially, have found the accused guilty. From that view, on this particular
point, Adamson, J. A. (ad hoc) dissented,
and with him I

[Page 539]

agree that the error in such a vital matter
cannot be held to have been unquestionably overborne by the rest of the case
presented.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct
a new trial.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed and
new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Trial—Evidence—Charge of
murder—Alleged misdirection in trial judge’s charge to jury—Provocation (Cr.
Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 86, s. 261; reduction of murder to
manslaughter)—“Insult”—Drunkenness of accused as matter for consideration with
regard to his acting on the “wrongful act or insult”—Onus of proof as to
defences of drunkenness, provocation.

Conviction of appellant of the murder of his
wife was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1947] O.R. 332,
Roach J.A. dissenting (holding there should be a new trial) on grounds, (1)
that there was misdirection and non-direction in the trial judge’s charge to
the jury with reference to the defence of provocation, as a result of which the
full theory of the defence with respect to provocation was not stated by him to
the jury; (2) that he erred in his charge by telling the jury several times
that the burden of proof lay upon the accused to satisfy them with respect to
his defences of drunkenness and of provocation by a preponderance of evidence,
and, though at other times in the charge he gave a correct statement of the law
as to the onus of proof, yet it could not be concluded with certainty that the
jury must have had a proper understanding of it. Appellant brought tan appeal
to this Court, based on those dissents, and also, by leave granted under s.
1025, Cr. Code, on the ground that the decision appealed from conflicted
with that of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Harms, 66
Can. Crim. Cas. 134 on the following point: assuming the facts permitted the
jury to find that they were “sufficient to deprive an ordinary -person of the
power of self-control” under s. 261 (2), Cr. Code, may the jury, in
deciding whether or not the provocation did in fact produce a passion that led
to the fatal act, take into account the actual condition of the accused in
respect to drunkenness.

At the trial appellant gave evidence, which
included evidence of words spoken between himself and his wife and, after a
certain answer by his wife, a slap by her on his head, and that he did not
remember what happened after that until he was trying to pick her up from the
floor.

Held: The
conviction should be set aside and a new trial held.

Per The Chief
Justice and Kerwin J.: Both grounds of said dissent were rightly taken.

As to the first ground: Under s. 261 (3), Cr.
Code, it was for the jury to say “whether or not any particular wrongful
act or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked
was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he
received”. The jury were entitled to believe the whole, or part, or

[Page 463]

none, of appellant’s testimony; if they
accepted the whole, they were at least entitled to consider the wife’s answer
in connection with the slap; if they accepted only the evidence as to the
conversation between appellant and his wife, they were entitled, in view of the
word “insult” in s. 261, to consider whether that was sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control; and these matters were not put to
the jury.

As to the second ground: Reading in its
entirety what the trial judge said to the jury, it is impossible to say that
there was no error; the jury did not have such a clear and correct direction as
the accused was entitled to; and under all the circumstances it could not be
said that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. The third
ground of appeal should not have effect. Should a jury find that what was complained
of was sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control,
then, in deciding whether the accused was actually so deprived, they are not
entitled to take into consideration any alleged drunkenness on the part of the
accused. Rex. v. Harms (supra) disapproved on this
point.

Per Taschereau
and Kellock JJ.: Appellant should succeed on the first ground of said dissent
and also on the third ground of appeal. If the jury believed appellant’s
evidence, his wife’s act of slapping him, which was wrongful in itself, was
also, against its verbal background (in a meaning which it was open to the jury
to give to the words spoken), an “insult”, within the meaning of that word in
s. 261 (2). It was (under s. 261 (3)) for the jury to find (1) as to the
sufficiency of the particular wrongful act or insult to cause an ordinary
person to be deprived of self-control, and (2) whether appellant was thereby
actually deprived of his self-control. In finding on the latter question the
jury should consider the effect on appellant’s mind of the intoxication to
which he was subject at the time, if they should find he was intoxicated to any
degree. Rex v. Harms (supra) approved.

As to the erroneous direction several times
to the jury as to onus with respect to drunkenness and provocation, and the
effect of this upon the jury in view of correct statements of the matter to the
jury at other times: As there is to be a new trial, it is sufficient to refer
to Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 462,
at 481 and 482, where the trial judge’s duty on such matter is clearly defined.

Per Estey J.:
As to the first ground of said dissent: The conversation and the slap (of
appellant’s evidence thereon was believed by the jury) would, under all the
circumstances, constitute evidence of a “wrongful act or insult” within the
meaning of s. 261. An insult may be effected by either words or acts or a
combination of both. Appellant’s wife’s words and her act were so closely
associated that their meaning and effect could only be determined by
considering them together and in relation to all the surrounding circumstances.
It was a misdirection to charge the jury in such a way that their consideration
was directed to the slap alone.

As to the third ground of appeal: If the jury
found the “insult” of such a nature as to be “sufficient to deprive an ordinary
person of the power of self-control”, then, in considering whether the accused
“acted upon it on the sudden and before there had been time for his

[Page 464]

passion to cool”, the jury might consider any
facts in evidence that might have influenced the accused to act or not to act
upon it, including his consumption of liquor and its effect upon him. (The view
taken on this point in Rex v. Harms, supra, approved).

Whether the effect of the trial judge’s
repeated misdirection to the jury as to onus of proof was corrected in their
minds by his correct statements of the law at other times in his charge, it was
not necessary to determine, as a new trial must be had on other grounds above.
(The law as to burden of proof in criminal trials stated, with explanatory
discussion thereon, and reference to the Woolmington case, supra, at
p. 481).

APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]
dismissing (Roach J.A. dissenting) his appeal from his conviction, at trial
before Chevrier J. and a jury, on a charge of murder. The appeal was on grounds
of the dissent taken by Roach J.A. (who held there should be a new trial), and
also on a ground raised by leave granted under s. 1025  of the Criminal Code  (R.S.C.
1927, c. 36). The said grounds are stated in the reasons for judgment in this
Court now reported and are indicated in the above headnote.

G.A. Martin K.C. and W.A. Donohue for the
appellant.

W.B. Common K.C. and W.M. Martin K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.
was delivered by

KERWIN J.—The appellant was convicted of the
murder of his wife and that conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for
Ontario with Mr. Justice Roach dissenting on the ground that there was
misdirection and non-direction in the charge of the trial judge with reference
to the defence of provocation as a result of which the full theory of the
defence with respect to provocation was not put by him to the jury. This is the
only ground of dissent stated in the formal judgment, but in his reasons,
Mr. Justice Roach also dissented on the ground that the trial judge erred
in his charge by telling the jury several times that the burden of proof lay
upon the accused to satisfy them with respect to his defence of drunkenness and
of provocation by a preponderance of evidence. Although this second ground does

[Page 465]

not appear in the formal judgment, this Court is
entitled to look at the reasons of the dissenting judge: Reinblatt v. The
King[2].

The appellant appeals from the Order of the
Court of Appeal based on these two dissents. By leave of Mr. Justice Rand,
granted under section 1025  of the Criminal Code , the appellant also
appeals on the ground that the decision a quo conflicts with the
decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Harms[3] on the point whether, assuming the facts
permitted the jury to find that they were sufficient to deprive an ordinary
person of the power of self-control under section 261 (2)  of the Criminal
Code , the jury, in deciding whether or not the provocation did in fact
produce a passion that led to the fatal act, might take into account the actual
condition of the accused in drunkenness. Mr. Justice Rand treated what was
said in this respect by the Chief Justice of Ontario for the majority of the
Court of Appeal, not as a mere dictum but as laying down a proposition by which
that Court would be subsequently bound. It is open to the Court to come to a
contrary conclusion but, upon consideration of the reasons of the Chief
Justice, it would appear that he meant his remarks upon the subject to be
treated as laying down a binding rule.

As there should be a new trial, I mention only
such circumstances as are necessary for a determination of the three questions
thus raised. At the trial, the appellant testified that, some days before the
night his wife received the injuries from which she died, he warned her never
to be alone with one Holmes because of something the appellant had witnessed
between Holmes and Mrs. Morgan. There was evidence that throughout that
night and evening the appellant had been drinking at several places before
returning with his wife and Holmes to his own home. At some stage, the
appellant’s wife went out of the house. The appellant testified: that, being
alone in his house, he heard the sound of a motor car which he stated he
recognized as being Holmes’ motor car; that his wife shortly thereafter came in
the house and when he asked her “Where have you been?”, she did not answer;
that he said, “You have been out with Harry Holmes”, to

[Page 466]

which she replied “So what? Harry Holmes is all
right”,—which, he testified, meant to him that she thought Holmes a better man
than he, and when asked in what respect, he answered, “Well, that would depend
on how a woman judged a man”; he further testified that when he said to her
“You have been out with Harry Holmes”, he meant that as an accusation of
misconduct; upon being asked at the trial what happened after his wife answered
“So what? Harry Holmes is all right”, he replied, “She walked over to me and
slapped me a good one on the side of the head”, he said that he did not
remember what happened after that until he was trying to pick his wife up from
the floor.

As to both drunkenness and provocation, the
trial judge several times charged the jury correctly as to the onus remaining
throughout upon the Crown to prove a charge of murder beyond a reasonable
doubt, but on several occasions he put it as if there were an onus on the
accused to make out such a case of drunkenness or provocation as would reduce
the crime charged from murder to manslaughter. This was misdirection: Woolmington
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[4],
and the first general proposition stated by Viscount Simon in Mancini v.
Director of Public Prosecutions[5].

Woolmington’s
case4 is concerned with explaining and reinforcing the
rule that the prosecution must prove the charge it makes beyond reasonable
doubt, and, consequently, that if, on the material before the jury, there is a
reasonable doubt, the prisoner should have the benefit of it.

Finally, after the jury had been out for three
hours, they came in and the foreman addressed the judge:—

In your address to the jury, you spoke in
regards to provocation as regards to the sobriety item, and you spoke of
drunkenness as a second item, and it is the end of your remarks. In other
words, summarizing your address, you pointed out that we should take all the
facts into consideration. Well, we need some guidance in regard to combined
provocation and drunkenness.

The trial judge replied in part as follows:—

Well, gentlemen, if you are satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt the accused is the one who killed Rita Taylor, then
you have provocation and drunkenness to look after. If he was provoked to the
point that I have indicated, and you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that there was then provocation, that provocation would reduce that to
manslaughter.

[Page 467]

It is true that he proceeded to state the matter
in terms that could not be objected to, but in view of the conflicting
directions in his charge before the jury retired and of the error in the first
part of his answer upon their return,

If he was provoked to the point that I have
indicated, and you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was then
provocation, that provocation would reduce that to manslaughter.

I am forced to the conclusion that the jury did
not have such a clear and correct direction as the accused was entitled to.
Reading the charge in its entirety and particularly the whole of the trial
judge’s answer to the foreman’s question, I find it impossible to say that
there was no error. Mr. Justice Roach was, therefore, right in his second
ground of dissent, and under all the circumstances I cannot say that there was
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

I now turn to Mr. Justice Roach’s first
ground of dissent. The criminal law for Canada on the subject of provocation is
set out in section 261  of the Criminal Code .

261. Culpable homicide, which would
otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes
death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.

2. Any wrongful act or insult, of such a
nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control, may be provocation if the offender acts upon it on the sudden,
and before there has been time for his passion to cool.

3. Whether or not any particular wrongful
act or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked
was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he
received, shall be questions of fact: Provided that no one shall be held to
give provocation to another by doing that which he had a legal right to do, or
by doing anything which the offender incited him to do in order to provide the
offender with an excuse for killing or doing bodily harm to any person.

4. The illegality of an arrest shall not
necessarily reduce an offence of culpable homicide from murder to manslaughter,
but if the illegality was known to the offender it may be evidence of
provocation.

Except for a few immaterial variations, this is
the same as section 176 of the Draft Code prepared by the Criminal Code 
Commission of 1878-79 in England, which section is set out in the third
volume of Stephen’s History of the Criminal Law in England at page 81. A Bill
was prepared for enactment to carry out the provisions of the Draft Code and
that part of the Commission’s report relating to

[Page 468]

the provisions of the Draft Code and of the Bill
dealing with provocation is set out in Taschereau’s Criminal Code  at page 156:—

There is no substantial difference between
the provisions of the Draft Code and the Bill dealing with provocation, though
the language and arrangement differ. Each introduces an alteration of
considerable importance into the common law. By the existing law, the
infliction of a blow, or the sight by the husband of adultery committed with
his wife, may amount to provocation which would reduce murder to manslaughter.
It is possible that some other insufferable outrages might be held to have the
same effect. There is no definite authoritative rule on the subject, but the
authorities for saying that words can never amount to a provocation are
weighty. We are of opinion that cases may be imagined where language would give
a provocation greater than any ordinary blow. The question whether any
particular act falls or not within this line appears to us to be pre‑eminently
a matter of degree for the consideration of the jury.

The Bill was never enacted into law and in
England, therefore, the matter is still dealt with at common law. It is in the
light of these circumstances that the decisions of the House of Lords in Mancini’s
case[6] and in Holmes
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[7]
must be read.

In the enunciation of the second general
proposition in the Mancini case6 it is said:—

If the evidence before the jury at the end
of the case does not contain material on which a reasonable man could find a
verdict of manslaughter instead of murder, it is no defect in the summing-up
that manslaughter is not dealt with.

That may be taken as generally true in Canada in
the sense that in order to raise a question of manslaughter there must be some
foundation for it at the trial. That is true also in so far as provocation is
concerned, subject to the express terms of section 261 of the Code. Earlier
in the Mancini case6 (at p. 10), Viscount Simon had stated:—

In that view [i.e., that Mancini’s story
was rejected] the only knife used in the struggle was the appellant’s dagger,
and this followed Distleman’s coming at him and aiming a blow with his hand or
fist. Such action by Distleman would not constitute provocation of a kind which
could extenuate the sudden introduction and use of a lethal weapon like this
dagger, and there was, therefore, on the assumption that the appellant’s
evidence was rejected, no adequate material to raise the issue of provocation.

The position at common law is again set forth in
Holmes’ case7, at page 597:—

If there is no sufficient material, even on
a view of the evidence most favourable to the accused, for a jury (which means
a reasonable

[Page 469]

jury) to form the view that a reasonable
person so provoked could be driven, through transport of passion and loss of
self-control, to the degree and method and continuance of violence which
produces the death it is the duty of the judge as matter of law to direct the
jury that the evidence does not support a verdict of manslaughter.

Thus at common law the House of Lords has
declared that it is the province of the judge to decide whether there is any
evidence of provocation proper to be dealt with by the jury, but for Canada
subsection 3 of section 261 of our Code provides:—

Whether or not any particular wrongful act
or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked was
actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he
received, shall be questions of fact.

This is not to say that in a proper case the
trial judge should not draw the jury’s attention to the nature of the
provocation and the mode of resentment and ask them to consider whether the
latter bears a reasonable relation to the provocation, but the
subsection clearly enacts that it is not the province of the judge to
decide such matters.

The Chief Justice of Ontario considered that the
wife of the appellant repudiated the latter’s implied accusation, and
continues:—

In the circumstances I am strongly of the
opinion that her words and conduct in so doing did not constitute provocation
within section 261 . They were the answer to be expected from a woman of
any spirit to an unfounded charge of infidelity made by a husband who himself
had been so occupied with his drink that he did not know even where she was. In
my opinion there was no evidence to go to the jury in this case that would
support the plea of provocation set up by the appellant.

The issue, however, was raised, so that it
cannot be said that there was no foundation for it, and the meaning to be
ascribed to the wife’s equivocal answer to the appellant’s query, taken in
conjunction with the slap, was for the jury. As is pointed out in the extract
from the report of the English Criminal Code Commission set out above:—

The question whether any particular act
falls or not within this line appears to us to be pre-eminently a matter of
degree for the consideration of the jury.

And the matter is thus put by Sir Lyman Duff,
speaking for this Court in The King v. Manchuk[8]:—

We think it was a question for the jury
whether (a) the acts relied upon as constituting provocation were
calculated to deprive an ordinary

[Page 470]

man of self-control to such an extent as to
cause an attack upon Mrs. Seabright of such a character as that delivered
by the accused.

Viscount Simon stated in the Holmes’ case[9] at page 600 that it was not necessary to
decide whether there were any conceivable circumstances accompanying the use of
words without actual violence, which would justify the leaving to a jury of the
issue of manslaughter as against murder, but continued:—

It is enough to say that the duty of the
judge at the trial, in relevant cases, is to tell the jury that a confession of
adultery without more is never sufficient to reduce an offence which would otherwise
be murder to manslaughter, and that in no case could words alone, save in
circumstances of a most extreme and exceptional character, so reduce the crime.
When words alone are relied upon in extenuation, the duty rests on the judge to
consider whether they are of this violently provocative character, and if he is
satisfied that they cannot reasonably be so regarded, to direct the jury
accordingly.

The wording of our Code, however, is “any
wrongful act or insult”, and the word “insult”, as generally understood and as
defined in standard dictionaries, includes language as distinct from acts: Rex
v. Krawchuk[10]. The
reason for the recommendation of the English Criminal Code Commission is
expressed as follows:—

We are of opinion that cases may be
imagined where language would give a provocation greater than any ordinary
blow.

and our Code follows the Draft Code and Bill.

The jury were entitled to believe the whole, or
part, or none, of the accused’s testimony. If they accepted it in its entirety,
they were at least entitled to consider the wife’s answer in connection with
the slap, and, if they accepted only the evidence relating to the conversation
between the appellant and his wife, they were entitled, in view of the word
“insult”, to consider whether that was sufficient to deprive an ordinary person
of the power of self-control. These matters were not put to the jury, and the
first ground of dissent by Roach J.A., is, therefore, well taken.

I pass to the conflict between the decision of
the Court of Appeal in this case and that of the Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan in the Harms case[11]. The
argument, that the jury should have been directed that if they came to the

[Page 471]

conclusion that what was complained of was
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, they
then, in deciding whether the appellant was actually so deprived, must consider
the alleged drunkenness of the appellant, cannot, in my view, prevail. It is
important to refer again to subsection 2 of section 261 of the Code:—

2. Any wrongful act or insult, of such a
nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control, may be provocation if the offender acts upon it on the sudden,
and before there has been time for his passion to cool.

The criterion is the effect on an ordinary
person. It is true that a trial judge must at some stage ask the jury whether
the accused was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the
provocation which he received, because there may be cases where, because of
evidence of ill-will before the provocation or other circumstances, it would be
open to the jury to find that the accused did not so act. However, in coming to
a conclusion on that point, the jury is not entitled to take into consideration
any alleged drunkenness on the part of the accused. In my opinion, the matter
is tersely and correctly put by Roach J.A., when he says that the argument on
behalf of the appellant is tantamount to saying

the act or insult on which I rely would
have caused an ordinary man to lose his self‑control but not me. The only
reason I lost my self-control was because I was drunk.

The decision on this point in the Harms case11
cannot be supported.

The appeal should be allowed, the order of the
Court of Appeal and the conviction set aside, and a new trial directed.

The judgment of Taschereau and Kellock, JJ., was
delivered by

KELLOCK J.—The appellant was convicted on a
charge of murdering his wife. His appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was
dismissed, Roach J.A. dissenting. This appeal comes to this Court on two
questions of law pursuant to section 1023  of the Criminal Code , namely,
alleged misdirection in regard to provocation and alleged misdirection and
non-direction with respect to the burden of proof. There is a further question
raised pursuant to

[Page 472]

leave granted under section 1025 , as to
alleged conflict between the judgment in appeal and the decision of the Court
of Appeal of Saskatchewan in Rex v. Harms11. Mr.
Common submits that, notwithstanding the leave, this last point is not open as
there is in fact no conflict. It will be convenient to consider this point
first.

The way the matter is put is that the basis of
the judgment in appeal is that there was no evidence of provocation and
therefore anything said in relation to the decision in the Harms case11
was obiter. While in the judgment of the majority it is stated, not once
but twice, that there is no evidence of provocation, the point arising in the Harms
case11 is dealt with as a distinct ground of appeal and is
decided adversely to the appellant. I think, therefore, that the point was a
ground of decision and that conflict has been shown accordingly.

Provocation is governed by section 261 of
the Code. By subs. 1, the provocation with which the section deals is
sudden provocation, and the offender also must himself have acted “upon the
sudden”. By subs. 2 “any” wrongful act or insult may be provocation if
of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of
the power of self-control but only if the offender acts thereon. The
question, however, as to whether or not there is any evidence is for the court,
but, subject to that, it is provided by subs. 3 that the above two matters are
both questions of fact for the jury, namely:

(1) the sufficiency of the particular wrongful
act or insult to cause an ordinary person to be deprived of self-control, and

(2) whether the accused was actually deprived of
his self-control by such act or insult.

To appreciate the matters in controversy, it is
necessary to state shortly the relevant facts. I quote from the reasons for
judgment of Roach J.A. in the Court of Appeal:

Rita Taylor was the wife of the accused.
Together they resided in a residence which was originally intended as a summer
cabin, but which, due to a housing shortage, was occupied the year round, at a
place called Baxter’s Beach on the Canadian shore of the St. Clair River a
few miles outside the city of Sarnia. The accused was employed as a labourer at
a foundry in or near the city of Sarnia.

[Page 473]

On Friday, November 29th, he quit work at
noon and went to his home. In the afternoon he and his wife went into the city
of Sarnia where he, at least, did some shopping and later they went together to
the beverage room of a local hotel. There an orgy of drinking commenced which
was not concluded until somewhere around midnight out at Baxter’s Beach.

In the hotel the accused met a man called
Holmes, and he joined the accused and his wife at the latter’s table in the
beverage room. The accused did not have a motor car; Holmes did. Towards the
end of the afternoon Holmes suggested that he would drive the accused and his
wife to their home at Baxter’s Beach. Before leaving the city, however, and
shortly before 6 o’clock, Holmes and the accused went to a local wine shop and
purchased between them four bottles of cheap wine. Then Holmes drove the
accused and his wife to their home at the beach where all three proceeded to
drink the wine. Early in the evening a neighbour called Goodwin from a nearby
cabin joined them. While he was present, and about 9 o’clock, the appellant and
his wife got into an argument and they went into an adjoining bedroom. There is
some evidence of scuffling in the bedroom. The appellant emerged from that room
and said that he had given his wife a few “rabbit punches”. The accused states
that the argument developed as a result of the wife’s intoxicated condition,
and his insistence that she should go to bed. Whatever were the nature of the
“rabbit punches” the wife was not perceptibly hurt. She remained in the bedroom
and the three men went to Goodwin’s cabin, where the fourth and last bottle of
wine was consumed. Some little time later and while the men were still there,
the appellant’s wife came over to Goodwin’s cabin and joined them. The wine
having been exhausted, Holmes and the appellant and his wife drove in Holmes’
car to a bootlegger’s place where they drank beer. Leaving the bootlegger’s
place they returned to the appellant’s cabin, apparently, about 11 o’clock or a
little later, bringing with them three bottles of beer. Holmes and the
appellant went into the cabin but the wife apparently remained outside in the
car. Holmes and the appellant finished the beer and Holmes left about midnight.

The appellant stated in evidence that the
next he recalls was when he awoke and found himself on his bed dressed only in
a new suit of underwear which he had purchased that afternoon. He had no
recollection of having put on that underwear. He states that he was awakened by
the cold; he got up and realized that his wife was not there.

When Holmes arrived at his car he found the
wife half asleep—in a doze in the back seat. There was some conversation
between them which was not admissible in evidence, but as a result of which
Holmes and the wife drove around the country-side over a circuitous route and
returned to the neighbourhood of the accused’s cabin about one o’clock. They
stopped on the highway about a quarter of a mile from the Taylor cabin. There
the wife got out and walked home.

I should here interject that the appellant
swore in evidence that some days earlier he and this wife had some conversation
about Holmes, during which conversation he told her never to be alone with
Holmes because of an “incident” he had seen take place between Holmes and a
Mrs. Morgan who lived in a nearby cabin. Mrs. Morgan was a Crown
witness and on cross-examination she said that sometime earlier she had told
both Taylor and his wife that Holmes had tried to get “fresh” with her and to
have sexual intercourse with her.

As to what happened when the wife arrived
at the cabin in the early hour of the morning in question, we have only the
appellant’s word.

[Page 474]

In the evidence he stated that he heard the
noise from Holmes’ car. He identified that noise as coming from Holmes’ oar
because of the fact that apparently the car was lacking a muffler and made a
terrific noise. Realizing that his wife was not in the cabin, he concluded that
she was with Holmes. His evidence of what happened on her return is most
important, and is as follows: “Q. What, then, was your reaction on hearing this
car, realizing that your wife was away from the cabin? A. I was getting a
little mad, sir. Q. Now, what happened after that? A. My wife came in the
back door. I went out in the kitchen. I said, ‘Where have you been?’ I got no
answer. I said, ‘You have been out with Harry Holmes.’ Her answer to that was,
‘So what? Harry Holmes is all right.’ Q. Now, what did that convey to you,
Mr. Taylor? A. She thought him a better man than me. Q. In what respect?
A. Well, that would depend on how a woman judged a man. Q. What did you mean by
saying to her, ‘You have been out with Harry Holmes?’ Was it an accusation you
were making against her? A. It was. Q. Was it an accusation of misconduct with
Holmes? A. It was. Q. And her answer was, ‘So what? Harry Holmes is all right.’
Is that right? A. That is right, sir. Q. What happened after that? A. She
walked over to me and slapped me a good one on the side of the head. Q. Now,
Mr. Taylor, do you know what happened from there on? A. I do not, sir. Q.
What was the next thing chat you remember? A. I was trying to pick my wife up,
and I didn’t have the strength. Q. Have you any consciousness of the
passage of time between that last incident of the slap and the time you tried
to pick your wife up? A. I had not, sir.”

In the interval during which he swore he
had no recollection of what was happening, there can be no doubt that he caused
his wife most serious and grievous bodily injuries. He broke a chair over her
head or body, and probably struck her head with his fists. The attack can best
be described as maniacal.

Sometime about one-thirty o’clock that
morning the accused came to one of the nearby cabins and aroused the occupants.
They got up and went with the accused to his cabin where they found the wife on
the floor with frightful injuries to her head and bleeding profusely. A doctor
was called and later an ambulance and the wife was rushed to the hospital. She
died the following afternoon as a result of her injuries.

In these circumstances, the first question which
arises is, what is the matter in evidence upon which, if believed, the accused
was entitled to rely as constituting provocation within the meaning of the
statute. The learned trial judge in his charge, upheld by the majority below,
directed the jury that they could consider only the slap in the face and not
what was said by the deceased wife, taking the view that, as to the words
spoken, the point was covered by the decision of the House of Lords in Holmes
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[12].
Roach J.A. was of opinion that the Holmes case12 had no
application and that:

In my opinion it was grave error to
instruct the jury in that fashion and the result was that the whole theory of
the defence was not put to

[Page 475]

the jury. The theory of the defence was not
that the accused was provoked within the meaning of s. 261  by the mere slap;
the theory was that he was thus provoked by the slapping coupled with the words
spoken almost contemporaneously therewith and all the surrounding
circumstances.

As to the Holmes case12, it is
first to be observed that it is not a decision under a statute but upon the
common law. The actual decision that the words spoken in that case, namely, the
confession of the wife that she had been unfaithful, standing by themselves did
not amount to provocation, does not apply, in my opinion, to the case at bar.
The words spoken by the deceased were not the same as the words in question in
the Holmes case12, and, moreover, they do not stand by
themselves. Further, the statement of Viscount Simon that

in no case could words alone, save in
circumstances of a most extreme and exceptional character, so reduce the crime,

i.e. from murder to manslaughter, requires to be
placed against the language of the statute “any insult”, and, so viewed, cannot
in my opinion, be a correct statement under the Code. They were not intended to
be.

In the present case, the husband said to the
wife “You have been out with Harry Holmes”. At the least that amounted to a
statement that she had disregarded his injunction given previously, but it was
also open to the jury to interpret it as an accusation of misconduct with
Holmes. On the answer of the wife “So what? Harry Holmes is all right”, in my
opinion, it was open to the jury to believe that “So what?” meant either “Even
if that be so” or “It is so, what are you going to do about it?” or “There’s
nothing you can do about it”. “Insult” is defined in “The Oxford English
Dictionary” inter alia, as

an act, or the action, of attacking or
assailing; an open and sudden attack or assault without formal preparations;
injuriously contemptuous speech or behaviour; scornful utterance or action
intended to wound self-respect; an affront; indignity.

In my opinion the act of slapping, which was
wrongful in itself, was also, against its verbal background, an insult. I
therefore agree with Roach J.A. on this branch of the case.

Coming to the second question, the learned trial
judge refused to direct the jury that the fact that the accused

[Page 476]

was intoxicated to such degree, if any, as they
might find, was a matter which they might consider in determining whether or
not the accused

was actually deprived of the power of
self-control by the provocation which he received.

All the members of the Court of Appeal
considered that there was no error in this respect, the view of the majority
being that any such direction would be in conflict with the decision of the
House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[13]. This view was not accepted by the Court
of Appeal for Saskatchewan in the Harms case[14]. That Court regarded the Beard case13
as approving the direction of Baron Parke in Rex v. Thomas[15], which was applied in the Harms case14.
That direction was as follows:

But drunkenness may be taken into
consideration in cases where what the law deems sufficient provocation has been
given, because the question is, in such cases whether the fatal act is to be
attributed to the passion of anger excited by the previous provocation, and that
passion is more easily excitable in a person when in a state of intoxication
than when he is sober.

In support of the judgment in appeal
Mr. Common submits that the third proposition laid down by Lord Birkenhead
in Beard’s case[16] is in
conflict with the direction of Parke B. That proposition, to be found at p.
502, is as follows:

3. That evidence of drunkenness falling
short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to
constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by
drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut
the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.

For my part I am unable to see anything in the
language which is in conflict with the law as laid down in Rex v. Thomas[17]. The third proposition in Beard’s case16
draws the line between drunkenness of such a nature that capacity to form the
necessary intent is absent, and drunkenness of a lesser degree. A person doing
an act resulting in death while drunk to the greater extent, is guilty of
manslaughter only, whether provoked or not. If drunk to the lesser degree, the
same act may be reduced from murder to manslaughter if committed under
provocation as defined in section 261 . Intent in the last mentioned

[Page 477]

case is present at the time, because there is no
lack of capacity, and it cannot be said that a person free from alcohol who
acts in passion due to provocation lacked intent at the time although
then deprived of his self-control due to the passion which has been provoked.
In Woolmington’s case[18],
Viscount Sankey, L.C., said at 482:

When evidence of death and malice has been
given (this is a question for the jury) the accused is entitled to show, by
evidence or by examination of the circumstances adduced by the Crown that the
act on his part which caused death was either unintentional or provoked.

Lack of intention, then, is not an element in
the application of section 261 , and therefore the third proposition in Beard’s
case16 does not apply to it. In truth the proposition deals and
deals only with drunkenness as a defence and not with the aspect under
consideration in Rex v. Thomas17. I am unable to find
anything in Lord Birkenhead’s reference to Rex v. Thomas21
which throws doubt upon the soundness of that decision, and I find it still
cited as an authority in the Hailsham Edition of Halsbury, Vol. 9, p. 439, as
well as in Russell on Crime, the 9th Edition, p. 39. In Stephen’s Digest of the
Criminal Law, p. 231, Art. 317, the following is stated:

Provocation does not extenuate the guilt of
homicide unless the person provoked is at the time when he does the act
deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he has received;
and in deciding the question whether this was or was not the case, regard must
be had to the nature of the act by which the offender causes death, to the time
which elapsed between the provocation and the act which caused death, to the
offender’s conduct during that interval, and to all other circumstances tending
to show the state of his mind.

If intoxication to any degree is a circumstance
which may tend to affect the mind of a person, and it is generally agreed it
is, then, if Stephen J. be right, the jury must consider the effect on the mind
of the offender of the intoxication to which he was subject at the time if they
find he was intoxicated to any degree. That the proposition as stated by
Stephen J. correctly states the common law is established by the fact that it
was cited with approval by the House of Lords in Mancini v. Director
of Public Prosecutions[19]. The
statement in the judgment of Viscount

[Page 478]

Simon on the same page as to the relationship
between the mode of resentment and the provocation reserved is not, under the
Code, a matter of law, but a matter to be considered by the jury when
determining whether or not the accused acted as he did by reason of the
provocation. As put by Stephen J. in the passage already quoted,

regard must be had to the nature of the act
by which the offender causes death.

In my opinion, therefore, the Harms case[20] was rightly decided. It is admitted, this
being so, that the charge cannot be supported on this branch of the case.

If the jury be directed to disregard any degree
of intoxication to which they may believe the accused was subject at the time,
the result will be that the question which they will be considering is whether
the accused, if he had not been intoxicated, would have acted on the
provocation, instead of the question directed by the statute, namely, whether
the accused in his then actual state of mind so acted.

There remains the question as to the admittedly
erroneous direction of the learned trial judge to the jury, repeated on several
occasions, as to the matter of onus with respect to both drunkenness and
provocation. There was considerable argument as to the effect of this upon the
jury in view of the fact that upon other occasions the learned trial judge
stated the matter correctly. In view of the fact that there is to be a new
trial, it will perhaps be sufficient to say that the duty of a judge presiding
at a criminal trial with respect to this matter is clearly defined in Woolmington’s
case[21] at
pages 481 and 482. If the law as there laid down is followed at the new trial,
as no doubt it will be, there should be no further difficulty on this point.I
would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

ESTEY J.—The accused, convicted for the murder
of his wife, appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. At his trial, apart
from contending that he had not committed the offence, he pleaded drunkenness
and provocation as separate grounds for reducing the offence to manslaughter.
The majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the con-

[Page 479]

viction, but Mr. Justice Roach dissented on
the basis that the learned trial judge had misdirected the jury as to what
constituted evidence of provocation and as to the burden of proof both with
respect to drunkenness and provocation.

This appeal is taken under section 1023  of
the Criminal Code  upon those points raised in the dissenting judgment
and on a further point as a consequence of leave granted under
section 1025  of the Criminal Code  on the basis of possible conflict
between the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal in this case and
that of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Rex v. Harms20.

The evidence disclosed that the accused, his
wife and Harry Holmes had been drinking downtown in the afternoon of November
29, 1946, that in the late afternoon they had all gone to the home of the
accused in Harry Holmes’ car. Harry Holmes remained there and all three
continued drinking. During the evening they visited two homes and returned to
the home of the accused around 11 o’clock. Sometime thereafter the accused fell
asleep on his bed. When he later awoke, he was alone in the house.

In a few minutes he heard a car upon the road
and from its noise concluded it was the car of Harry Holmes. As he had warned
his wife not to be alone with Harry Holmes, this made him a “little mad”. In a
few minutes his wife came in the back door, and to his inquiry as to where she
had been she made no reply. He then, as he deposed, accused her of improper
conduct in these words: “You have been out with Harry Holmes”. Her reply was:
“So what? Harry Holmes is all right” and with that he says “she walked over to
me and slapped me a good one on the side of the head.” He deposed that as to
what followed he had no recollection. Harry Holmes deposed that after the
accused went to sleep, he went out to his car and found Mrs. Taylor there,
that she refused to get out of the car and that as a result they drove around
for some time and then she went home and he continued to his home.

At about 1.30 a.m. the accused called at his
neighbour, Morgan’s, for assistance. Mr. and Mrs. Morgan went at once
to his home where they found Mrs. Taylor unconscious and bleeding as a
result of a brutal attack, as a consequences of which she died later the same
day.

[Page 480]

With deference to the learned judges who hold a
contrary opinion, it would appear that the conversation and the slap here
deposed to, if believed, would under all the circumstances constitute evidence
of a “wrongful act or insult” from which the jury might find provocation within
the meaning of section 261  of the Criminal Code .

His Lordship charged the jury that the slap in
the face alone could be considered as evidence of provocation and that the
foregoing words and their implication of immorality did not constitute evidence
of provocation and must be disregarded in the consideration of that issue. This
direction is based on statements similar in effect in the decisions at common
law, more recently discussed in Holmes v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[22], where
it would appear that even at common law there is some qualification to the
general statement that mere words cannot constitute evidence of provocation.

We need not here, however, discuss the precise
statement of the common law. Parliament, in enacting section 261  of the
Criminal Code , has declared the law with respect to provocation in Canada:

261. (Provocation) Culpable homicide, which
would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who
causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.

2. (What is provocation) Any wrongful act
or insult, of such a nature as to; be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person
of the power of self-control, may be provocation if the offender acts upon it
on the sudden, and before there has been time for his passion to cool.

3. (Question of fact) Whether or not any
particular wrongful act or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not
the person provoked was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the
provocation which he received, shall be questions of fact: Provided that no one
shall be held to give provocation to another by doing that which he had a legal
right to do, or by doing anything which the offender incited him to do in order
to provide the offender with an excuse for killing or doing bodily harm to any
person.

4. (Illegal arrest) The illegality of an
arrest shall not necessarily reduce an offence of culpable homicide from murder
to manslaughter, but if the illegality was known to the offender it may be
evidence of provocation.

Under this section, when there is evidence of
“any wrongful act or insult” it is for the jury to determine whether it is

of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control.

[Page 481]

If, therefore, there is any evidence of any
wrongful act or insult, this must be submitted to the jury in such a fair and
complete manner that the jury will appreciate the law, and the evidence in
relation to that issue.

Under this section 261  an insult may
constitute provocation, and an insult may be effected by either words or acts
or a combination of both. In the case at bar, the words of Mrs. Taylor and
her act were so closely associated that their meaning and effect can only be
determined by considering them together and in relation to all the surrounding
circumstances. This evidence adduced by the accused himself may or may not be
true, but that is entirely a question for the jury. The only concern of the
appellate court is the right of the accused to have his defence, so far as it
is supported in the evidence, fairly and fully placed before the jury. It was,
with respect, a misdirection to segregate the slap from the words and direct
the jury that the slap alone should be considered in determining whether there
was sufficient provocation within the meaning of section 261 .

If the jury found that this insult was

of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control,

then that insult was in this case provocation.
If and when the jury found such provocation, it was then their duty under
section 261  to consider whether the accused acted “upon it on the sudden”
and before there had been time for his passion to cool, or, as stated by Chief
Justice Duff in The King v. Manchuk[23]:

We think it was a question for the
jury * * * whether in fact the accused was by reason of
what occurred deprived of his self-control to such a degree; and in his
attack * * * was acting upon such provocation on a sudden
and before his passion had time to cool * * *

In determining this question whether the accused
acted on the sudden upon this provocation, the jury must consider the conduct
of the accused himself as distinguished from the conduct of the ordinary man.
Upon this question or issue the jury may consider any facts in evidence that
may have influenced the accused to act or not to act upon that provocation
already found by them. His consumption of liquor and its effect upon him may be
taken into con-

[Page 482]

sideration upon the second question where his
own conduct is under consideration, but not upon the first question where the
standard is that the wrongful act or insult must be such as to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control in order to constitute
provocation.

That was the view expressed in Rex v. Harms[24]. It was submitted at the hearing that Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[25]
was contrary to Rex v. Harms24. In the Beard case25,
the House of Lords was considering the defence of drunkenness as evidence of
inability to form the intent essential in the crime of murder. Drunkenness in
relation to its effect upon the action of one who had suffered provocation
within the meaning of the law was not an issue nor was it discussed further
than a mere reference thereto. Rex v. Thomas[26], cited in support of the reasons in Rex
v. Harms24, is mentioned along with certain other
authorities in the Beard case25 where the Lord Chancellor, in
referring particularly to these cases, states at p. 497:

The judgments however in these cases
diverged into topics not specifically helpful in the matter now under debate.

With geat respect, I do not find the suggested
conflict between the Beard[27] and
the Harms[28] cases.

The charge of the learned trial judge relative
to drunkenness sufficient to render the accused unable to form the intent
essential in the crime of murder was not questioned before this Court further
than with respect to the burden of proof both as to the defence of drunkenness
and provocation. It was contended, as Mr. Justice Roach held, the learned
trial judge had instructed the jury that the burden of proof rested upon the
accused to prove either of these defences by a preponderance of evidence. The
learned judge pointed out that this burden upon the accused was not so great as
to require that he prove his drunken condition beyond a reasonable doubt, but
he repeated at different times in the course of his charge that the accused
must prove either of these defences by preponderance of evidence. With respect,
this constituted a misdirection.

[Page 483]

However, about as often as this direction was
given, it was offset by a correct statement that throughout the entire trial
the burden rested upon the Crown to prove the accused guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt. Whether, therefore, the effect of the misdirection upon this
point was corrected in the minds of the jury we need not here determine, as a
new trial must be had upon the basis already discussed with respect to
provocation. It is sufficient to emphasize that, apart from the defence of
insanity and a statutory provision with respect to the burden of proof, the
burden of proof rests always and throughout the entire case upon the Crown to
prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence
favourable to the accused, either as found in the evidence adduced by the Crown
or adduced on his own behalf, may be sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in
the minds of the jury. The position is that if after all the evidence, both for
the Crown and the defence, has been seriously considered, the jury is unable to
conclude that the evidence establishes the guilt of the accused beyond a
reasonable doubt, then he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty.

In Woolmington v. The Director of Public
Prosecutions[29], Lord
Sankey at p. 481 states:

* * * it is not till the end of
the evidence that a verdict can properly be found and that at the end of
the evidence it is not for the prisoner to establish his innocence, but for the
prosecution to establish his guilt. Just as there is evidence on behalf of the
prosecution so there may be evidence on behalf of the prisoner which may cause
a doubt as to his guilt. In either case, he is entitled to the benefit of the
doubt. But while the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner, there is
no such burden laid on the prisoner to prove his innocence and it is sufficient
for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt; he is not bound to satisfy the jury
of his innocence.

See also Mancini v. Director of
Public Prosecutions[30].

In the result, a new trial must be held. The
appeal is allowed.

Appeal allowed; conviction set aside,
and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Speedy Trials of Indictable
Offences by County Court Judge—Several Charges—Mixing Trials—Refusal to hear
argument and deliver judgment at conclusion of each charge—Criminal Code , ss.
838 , 839  and 857 (2) .

The accused, appellants, were charged on a
number of counts on which, following a preliminary hearing, they elected speedy
trial under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36. The Crimes charged
fell into four groups. Those in the first group arose out of the breaking and
entering of premises in the township of York on the 23rd August 1945; in the
second, out of an armed robbery in the city of Hamilton on the 26th August
1945; in the third, out of an armed robbery in the city of Toronto on the 16th
September 1945; and in the fourth, out of an armed robbery in the city of
Stratford on the 12th October 1945.

As to the first group, both the appellants
and one Dobbie were jointly charged on counts 1, 2 and 3. As to the second, the
appellant Green alone was charged on count 7 and 8. As to the third, the
appellant Constantine and one Hiscox were jointly charged on counts 4 and 5,
and as to the fourth, both appellants were charged on count 6.

The accused Dobbie did not appear for trial.

[Page 540]

Counsel for the accused at the opening of the
trial, requested that each charge be tried separately, but acceded to the
suggestion of the Court, that those offences which arose out of the same set of
circumstances should be tried together. The trial of the appellants on counts
1, 2 and 3 was then proceeded with, and when all the evidence had been heard,
counsel for the accused, asked the Court to hear argument and deliver judgment
before proceeding to hear the evidence on any of the other counts. The trial
judge refused and stated that he would hear the evidence on all the charges and
then give counsel an opportunity to present argument on all of them before he
would deliver judgment. All the evidence was then heard on count 6, then on
counts 7 and 8 and finally on counts 4 and 5.

At the conclusion of all the evidence on all
the charges, the trial judge heard argument on all the charges and then
reserved judgment. Four days later he delivered judgment and found the
appellants guilty on counts 1, 3 and 6 and not guilty on count 2; the appellant
Green guilty on counts 7 and 8; the appellant Constantine and the accused
Hiscox not guilty on counts 4 and 5, and sentenced the appellants to 14 years
imprisonment on each charge, sentences to be concurrent.

On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario,
the convictions on counts 1 and 3 were quashed and a new trial directed, but
the appeal against the conviction of the appellants on count 6, and that of the
appellant Green on counts 7 and 8 were dismissed.

It was contended on appeal to the Appeal
Court of Ontario, that the trial judge erred in mixing the trials by refusing
to hear argument and deliver judgment at the conclusion of the evidence on each
charge or group of charges, where two or more were tried together; and by
reserving judgment until he had heard all the evidence on all the charges.

This submission was not accepted by the
appellate court, who followed its own previous decision in Rex v. Bullock[1]; that decision being in conflict with the
decision of the Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia in The Queen v. McBerney[2], application to appeal to this Court was
granted under section 1025  of the Criminal Code .

Held, affirming
the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1947] O.R. 264; [1947] O.W.N.
325; [1947] 3 D.L.R. 32, the appeal should be dismissed. Nothing should detract
from the salutary rule that everything should be done to avoid even the
appearance of prejudice in the mind of the convicting judge against the
prisoner arising out of facts developed in a later prosecution, and, therefore
the ordinary practice should be followed that one case should be disposed of,
so far as the verdict is concerned, before entering upon the consideration of
another. Irrespective of s. 838  of the Criminal Code , by which the judge
may adjourn the hearing, it should not be laid down (as a rule of law) that a
judge must acquit or convict in all cases before proceeding with another charge
against the same accused; or must announce his decision on one count against
two accused before proceeding with the trial of one of them on other counts.
There may be cases where it is necessary to do so because an accused might, on
the

[Page 541]

subsequent trial, plead autre fois acquit or
autre fois convict, and in no case may a judge convict a person on one charge by
reason of evidence heard on the trial of another charge but, if it appears
that these rules have not been infringed, then the convictions should not be
set aside.

The joinder in a single charge sheet of
several counts on which an accused has been committed for trial on a single
information is permitted, The King v. Deur [1944] S.C.R. 435 and by
section 857 (2)  of the Criminal Code , which appears in Part XIX but
which, by section 839 , is made applicable to the formal statement and
trial under Part XVIII, the Court, if it thinks it conducive to the ends of
justice to do so, may direct that the accused shall be tried upon any one or
more of such counts separately, subject to the proviso therein expressed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario[3] insofar
as that judgment affirmed convictions of the appellants on charges of armed
robbery by his Honour Judge Parker sitting in the County Judges’ Criminal Court
of the County of York at the City of Toronto.

Gordon W. Ford and Charles L. Dubbin for
the appellants.

W.B. Common, K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

KERWIN J.—Leave to appeal from a decision of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario was granted on the ground that it conflicted with
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banco in The Queen v.
McBerny[4]. That
case decided that where a judge tries a charge without a jury under the Speedy
Trials clauses of the Criminal Code , it is not competent for him to
postpone his decision on a first charge against an accused until he has heard
the evidence on several other charges against the same party and to then decide
the question of guilt in all. In the judgment appealed from, the matter is treated
as one for consideration in each particular case and not as a rule of law of
general application.

[Page 542]

Of the other decision referred to, Hamilton
v. Walker[5] was
distinguished in the subsequent case of Regina v. Fry[6] where it appeared from an affidavit filed
on behalf of the justices that in adjudicating in each of several cases tried
before them they applied to that case the evidence given in reference to it and
no other, and that the evidence given in the second case in no way influenced
their decision on the first. The decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in
Rex v. Bullock[7]
followed the Fry case. The British Columbia Court of Appeal in The
King v. Iman Din[8],
divided equally on the question.

Nothing should detract from the salutary rule that
everything should be done to avoid even the appearance of prejudice in the mind
of the convicting judge against the prisoner arising out of facts developed in
a later prosecution, and, therefore, the ordinary practice should be followed
that one case should be disposed of, so far as the verdict is concerned, before
entering upon the consideration of another. I do not attach any importance to
section 838 of the Code by which the judge may adjourn the hearing.
Irrespective of that section, it should not be laid down that a judge must
acquit or convict in all cases before proceeding with the trial of another
charge against the same accused, or as in the case before us, announce his
decision on one count against two accused before proceeding with the trial of
one of them on other counts. There may be cases where it is necessary to do so
because an accused might, on the subsequent trial, plead autrefois acquit or
autrefois convict, and in no case may a judge convict a person on one charge by
reason of evidence heard on the trial of another charge but, if it appears that
these rules have not been infringed, then the convictions should not be set
aside. It is not without importance in disposing of the matter to bear in mind
that the joinder in a single charge sheet of several counts on which an accused
has been committed for trial on a single information is permitted: The King v.
Deur[9] and
that by section 857 (2) , which appears in Part XIX

[Page 543]

but which, by section 839 , is made
applicable to the formal statement and trial under Part XVIII, the Court,
if it thinks it conducive to the ends of justice to do so, maydirect that the
accused shall be tried upon any one or more of such counts separately,—subject,
of course to the proviso therein expressed.

In view of the evidence given in connection with
counts 6, 7 and 8 and the reasons of the trial judge, the rules set out above
have not been violated and the appeals should, therefore, be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Evidence—Admissibility
of—Admissions made by accused as witness on preliminary hearing of charge
against another—No objection made to questions as incriminating—No claim for
protection under section 5  of the Canada Evidence Act —Right of Crown to use
admissions on trial of accused—Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 69.

The appellant was convicted on charges of
having used a noxious fluid and instruments to procure an abortion. The facts
of the case are the following: One Ford was charged with manslaughter in
connection with the death of the woman in question. The appellant appeared as a
witness for the Crown at the preliminary inquiry. In the course of his
evidence, given without raising any objection nor claim for protection under
section 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , the appellant made certain
admissions which the Crown later put in evidence against him at his own trial.
The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground of improper
admission in evidence of these admissions; but the conviction was affirmed by a
majority of that Count.

Held: That the
deposition of the appellant was properly admitted and the appeal should be
dismissed—If a person testifying does not claim the protection provided for by
section 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , the evidence so given may be used
against him at his own subsequent trial.

Judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1946] 2
W.W.R. 97) affirmed.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming a
conviction, on a trial before Donovan J. and a jury, on charges of offences
relating to procuring an abortion.

Harry Walsh for
the appellant.

C. W. Tupper for
the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was
delivered by

Kerwin J.—The accused, Dr. David Tass, appeals from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Manitoba dismissing his appeal from a conviction on charges
that he

[Page 104]

did on or about October 22, 1944, unlawfully
administer to Agnès Ladéroute, a woman, with intent to procure a miscarriage of
the said Agnès Ladéroute, a noxious thing, to wit, a mixture of water, soap and
lysol, and that he, on the same day, unlawfully used instruments on Agnès
Ladéroute, a woman, with intent to procure a miscarriage of the said Agnès
Ladéroute. The appeal is based upon two grounds of dissent in law of Mr.
Justice Dysart although other matters of dissent are mentioned in the latter’s
judgment. As I have come to the conclusion that the appeal fails on the first
ground, I do not say anything as to the second because Mr. Walsh quite properly
agreed that, in that event, it would be unnecessary to do so.

Agnès Ladéroute died October 23, 1944. An
inquest was held and subsequently one Edward J. Ford was charged with
manslaughter in connection with the woman’s death and the preliminary inquiry
in connection with that charge was held before a police magistrate on November 23, 1944. Tass was subpoenaed to appear
as a witness at that inquiry. He attended and was sworn and gave evidence
without raising any objection to answering any question upon the ground that
his answer might tend to criminate him, as he was entitled to do by subsection
2  of section 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , After testifying that he had
been called to Ford’s house to attend the woman and that he found her dead, he
was asked as to what he found in the room and as to any previous knowledge he
had of the woman or of her condition. He admitted that he knew she was
pregnant, that he drove her in his automobile to a point about one and one-half
city blocks from Ford’s house and that he knew Ford would conduct an abortion
as he “felt he had done them before.” From these admissions and others in his
testimony at the preliminary inquiry, it is plain that, if the examination was
admissible, the jury was entitled to find him guilty.

I disagree with the view of the dissenting judge
below that this evidence of Tass was not relevant to the charge against Ford.
It was suggested that an arrangement had been made between certain members of
the police force and Crown counsel to put Tass in the witness box at Ford’s
preliminary inquiry in order to secure from Tass an admission

[Page 105]

of his guilt. It was even suggested that the
magistrate had been a party to this arrangement. I find no evidence that any of
the named parties had entered into such an arrangement or that it had been
decided to arrest and prosecute Tass before the preliminary inquiry into the
charge against Ford, and the matter is therefore left with Tass as a witness in
a proceeding under oath admitting his guilt of the crimes now charged against
him and that he did not claim the protection provided for by the Canada
Evidence Act . Under these circumstances the decision in Regina v.
Coote[2] is
conclusive.

It is true that at the time of that decision
there was no such provision as subsection 2  of section 5  of the Canada Evidence Act . That Act removes a safeguard a person had at common law to refuse to
answer any questions that might criminate him. He is now obliged to do so but
such evidence may not be used against him if he claims the protection of the
Act. It has been pointed out in several cases such as Rex v. Clark[3], Re Ginsberg[4]), and Rex v. Barnes[5] that the protection now afforded may not be
as wide as that under the common law and objections have been raised from time
to time as to the possibility of the evidence acquired under the Act being used
to build up a case against a person who may be subsequently charged with an
offence. However that may be, the matter seems quite clear that if the person
testifying does not claim the exemption, the evidence so given may be later
used against him, and this notwithstanding the fact that he may not known of
his rights; Regina case2.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ. was
delivered by

Kellock j.—This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of
Manitoba affirming (Dysart J. ad hoc dissenting) the conviction of the
appellant before Donovan J. and a jury on the 11th day of May, 1945, in respect
of two counts in an indictment, namely, attempt to procure a miscarriage and
use of instruments to procure a miscarriage.

[Page 106]

In view of the opinion which I have formed with
respect to the appeal it is necessary to mention only one ground of dissent.
The appellant had given evidence upon a preliminary inquiry with respect to
charges then pending against one Ford, arising out of the same facts out of
which the appellant was himself later charged and part of this evidence was
admitted against the appellant at his trial. Dysart J. was of opinion that this
evidence was inadmissible. His view may be summarized as follows: that the
evidence was irrelevant to the matter with which the preliminary inquiry was
concerned, namely, the pending
charges against Ford; that counsel for the prosecution had conducted the part
of the examination objected to from an improper motive, viz: merely to obtain
the admissions for use against the witness himself and that the magistrate was
a party to this scheme; that the appellant had ceased properly to be a witness
at all and his failure to avail himself of the provisions of section 5 of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C., c. 59 was immaterial and did not render his answers
subsequently admissible against him.

In the course of his reasons the learned judge
stated that the evidence in question had been

extracted from a man who was so strongly
suspected of complicity in Ford’s crime that the authorities had decided to
arrest and prosecute him.

However, counsel for the appellant before us
quite frankly admitted that this view of the learned judge was not supported by
the evidence.

When the evidence objected to is examined its
relevancy is not, in my opinion, open to objection. It is shown that there was
a common design between the appellant and Ford with respect to the matter in
question and the principle referred to in Koufis v. The King,[6] is applicable. The examination of the
appellant was therefore proper and accordingly there is no foundation for the
allegation as to any ulterior motive on the part of either the Crown Attorney
or the magistrate. Being properly before the magistrate it was for the
appellant to invoke the provisions of section 5  of the Canada Evidence Act . Not having done so his evidence is properly admissible against him.
It is not therefore necessary to consider whether the examination objected to
would have been other than

[Page 107]

admissible against Tass if it could have been established that it
was irrelevant to the pending charge against Ford. Rex v. Sloggett, (1);
Rex v. Graham, (2); The King v. Van Meter, (3) may
be referred to.

As to the other ground of dissent which was
argued before us, counsel for the appellant took the position that if he could
not support the first ground of dissent it was unnecessary for us to deal with
the second.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Charge to jury—General
principles—Misdirection—Accomplice—Corroboration—Reading of extract of opinion
given by a member of appellate court in a previous appeal—Substantive wrong or
miscarriage of justice.

The presence of the accused in his apartment
with the perpetrators of a crime shortly after its commission, and the
improbability of his evidence as to what occurred at that meeting, is capable
of affording corroboration of the evidence of accomplices implicating him when
considered in the light of all the evidence.

While the reading of an extract from the
reasons of one of the Judges of the Court of Appeal on an appeal by the accused
from his conviction at a previous trial is to be deprecated, this did not,
under the circumstances, result in a miscarriage of justice.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario dismissing (Laidlaw J. dissenting) the appellant’s appeal
from his conviction, on a trial before the General Sessions of the Peace at
Toronto, Shea J., on a charge of armed robbery and kidnapping.

appellant.

The judgment of Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau
J.J. was delivered by

TASCHEREAU, J.:—On the 31st of October, 1944,
the appellant was convicted for armed robbery, robbery, forcible restraining
and imprisonment of one George Butcher, and, on the 7th of May, 1945, the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] quashed this
conviction and ordered a new trial.

The new trial took place before His Honour Judge
Shea and a jury on the 19th of October, 1945, and on the 25th of October of the
same year, after having been found guilty, he was sentenced to a term of
fifteen years imprisonment in the Penitentiary at Kingston.

At the first trial, the appellant had been
charged with and tried together with Benedetto Zanelli, Samuel Mancuso, Edwin
MacDonald and William M. Baskett. Zanelli was also charged with the offence of
receiving stolen goods. The appellant, Mancuso, Edwin MacDonald and Baskett
were found guilty of armed robbery and imprisoning Butcher, but Zanelli was
found guilty only of receiving stolen goods. The appellant and Mancuso appealed
their convictions and sentences, and, while Mancuso’s appeal was dismissed, the
appellant’s conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered. Having been
convicted again at the second trial, MacDonald appealed, but the conviction was
confirmed, the Honourable Mr. Justice Laidlaw dissenting on questions
of law.

The facts are that on the 13th of December, 1943, a truck, containing
liquor valued at many thousands of dollars, was seized in the city of Toronto by several men, one of whom was
armed with an automatic pistol. The driver of the truck, named Butcher, was
forcibly confined in an automobile, and the truck and its contents were taken
to a barn on the premises of one Shorting, who operated a riding school known
as The Lazy L. Ranch.

The evidence reveals that, on the 10th day of
December, 1943, Mancuso (subsequently convicted of the armed robbery and
unlawfully imprisoning the said Butcher), in company with one Zanelli
(subsequently convicted of receiving the liquor), appeared at the riding school
and

[Page 92]

arranged with Shorting to rent his barn for
storage of “a few cases of Christmas liquor”. Wilkinson, who was an employee of
Shorting and working at the school with him, was given $5.00 by Mancuso for
“shaking some hay” over the liquor. Shorting himself received $20.00 for the
use of his barn.

In the evening of the 12th of December, Zanelli
telephoned Shorting to be at the barn at five o’clock the next morning.
Following these instructions, Shorting and Wilkinson went to the barn and were
met there by Zanelli. Shortly thereafter, an automobile containing four or five
men arrived and also the truck containing six hundred cases of liquor which
were unloaded. Later the same day, Shorting, through one Moberly, notified the Toronto police that the truck and liquor
were at his barn. After having taken possession of the truck and liquor, the
police visited the appellant’s apartment in Toronto at one p.m. the
same day, and there found Mancuso, Edwin MacDonald, Baskett (all subsequently
convicted of the armed robbery and unlawful imprisoning). The appellant, Kay
Donavan, a man by the name of Applebaum, a whiskey salesman, and another man by
the name of Taylor, who is a
known bootlegger, were also present. At the appellant’s trial, Shorting and
Wilkinson identified the appellant as being one of the men assisting in the
unloading. Shorting also stated that one other man, while doing the unloading,
referred to the appellant as “Mickey”, which was his nickname.

The appellant’s defence was an alibi, and in
giving evidence in his own defence, he swore that the stolen liquor was never
mentioned in his apartment, where all the men who had committed the crime a few
hours before gathered at one p.m. on the 13th of December.

In his dissenting judgment in the Court of
Appeal, Mr. Justice Laidlaw adopted the view that the learned trial judge erred
in law in instructing the jury, that, if they found Shorting or Wilkinson to be
accomplices, they might find corroboration of their testimony, as to
appellant’s presence at the barn, in the fact and circumstances of the meeting
at the appellant’s apartment, and from the fact also that the appellant’s
denial that the stolen liquor was

[Page 93]

discussed was implausible. The second ground of
dissent of Mr. Justice Laidlaw, is that counsel for the Crown improperly read
to the jury, observations made by the Honourable Mr. Justice McRuer (now
C. J. H. C.) in his, judgment on the previous appeal, on the credibility of the
witness Shorting.

The crimes for which the appellant was charged
are not crimes for which, under section 1002  of the Criminal Code ,
corroboration is essential. However, if Shorting and Wilkinson were found to be
accomplices in the perpetration of the crimes with which the appellant is
charged, it was imperative to give the jury the usual warning that it was
possible to convict without the evidence of Shorting and Wilkinson being
corroborated but that it was dangerous to do so.

In his address to the jury, His Honour Judge
Shea who presided at the trial said:

It is important for you to decide that,
because I have to instruct you as a matter of law that it is always dangerous
to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, though it is your
legal province to do so. Please note the word “uncorroborated”; it means
unstrengthened or unconfirmed. If you have the evidence of an accomplice, and
in addition you have something independent of that evidence, which strengthens
or confirms it, you have corroboration. But I must tell you here, also, that
the evidence of one accomplice cannot be taken in corroboration of the evidence
of another. It has to be additional evidence to that given by either one of
them. It need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime. The
evidence in corroboration must be independent evidence which affects the
accused, and connecting or tending to connect him in some material
circumstances.

The learned trial judge also explained to the
jury what was an accomplice, its legal meaning, and gave various definitions.
He said:

I will read you one or two of these
definitions: “An accomplice is one who knowingly * * * and
in a common intent with the principal offender, unites in the completion of a
crime.” Or, to determine if a witness is an accomplice, ask this question:
“Could the witness have been indicted under the wide provisions of the Code for
the offence for which the person has been convicted or is being tried?” And
other definition: “An accomplice is a party to the crime himself, who assists
in or is a partner of the crime.” One more: “Every person who knowingly,
deliberately co‑operates with or assists or even encourages another in
the completion of a crime is an accomplice.”

The questions were, therefore: Could it be said
that Shorting and Wilkinson were accomplices in the robbery

[Page 94]

of the liquor and of the imprisoning of Butcher?
And if so was the proper direction given to the jury, by the trial judge, as to
corroboration?

The definition of an accomplice is a question of
law, and the determination of all the elements that are necessary to constitute
corroboration is similarly a question for the trial judge. The trial judge must
direct the jury as to what are the essential requirements to make a person an
accomplice, and as to what is necessary to give a probative value to
corroborative evidence, and it is also his duty to instruct them as to the
legal evidence that must be adduced to establish complicity and corroboration.
But the weighing of the facts revealed by the evidence, as to whether a person
is an accomplice or not, and the question as to whether “corroborative inferences
should be drawn from the evidence”, are both within the exclusive province of
the jury. The King v. Christie,[2];
Hubin v. The King,[3]; Vigeant
v. The King,[4].

Corroboration must be found in some other legal
evidence which tends to implicate the accused. This other evidence may of
course be direct or circumstantial, oral or by writing or otherwise, as long as
it leads to the reasonable belief that the statement of the accomplice is true,
and does not let it stand alone. This additional evidence must be independent,
that is to say, it must be free from any acts or words attributable to the
witness for whom corroboration is sought, otherwise this witness would be a
party to his own corroboration. (The King v. Christie,[5]; Hubin v. The King,[6]. Likewise, an accomplice cannot be
corroborated by another accomplice, and it is further an essential ingredient
of corroboration that it should tend to show not only that a crime has been
committed, but that it has been committed by the accused.

Of course, corroboration must not be so meagre
that it should create a mere possibility that the accused has committed the
crime for which he is charged; it should be strong enough to sufficiently
impress the mind of the jury not with the probability of a conjecture, but with
the probability of the truth of a fact put in evidence. It need not be
conclusive, but it will be sufficient if it is pre-

[Page 95]

sumptive, provided that the facts independently
proven, and from which inferences are drawn, are consistent in tending to show
the guilt of the accused, and are inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion that the accused is the guilty person.

With deference, I am of opinion that the trial
judge has properly instructed the jury as to the law and as to their duties,
and that his charge is not impeachable.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario, in hearing the
first appeal in Rex. v. MacDonald and Rex. v. Mancuso, came to the
conclusion that a new trial in the case of MacDonald should be granted, because
the learned trial judge had warned the jury that Shorting might be considered
as an accomplice, but did not give the same warning as to Wilkinson. The Court
properly said that the warning should have been given as to both witnesses,
because the question as to whether they were accomplices or not was a question
to be decided by the jury after the proper instructions had been given to them.

But in the present case, the situation is
entirely different. The learned trial judge, after having given the proper
legal definition of an accomplice, left it to the jury to determine if in fact
Shorting and Wilkinson were accomplices. He then went on to explain that, if
they were found to be accomplices, it was dangerous to convict the appellant on
the uncorroborated evidence of Shorting and Wilkinson. He explained the legal
meaning of corroboration; told all that was essential to give a legal probative
value to corroborative evidence which must be of independent nature; he pointed
out that something outside the evidence of the witness must be found which
strengthens or confirms it; he said that the evidence of one accomplice cannot
be accepted as corroboration of the evidence of another, that it need not be
direct evidence, but that it may be circumstantial, as long as it connects or
tends to connect the accused with the charge against him in some material
circumstance. He also explained that if the jury found that they might decide
that Shorting was an accomplice and Wilkinson was not, in that event, the
evidence of the witness whom the jury found not to be an accomplice, could be
taken as corroboration of the evidence of the other.

[Page 96]

These directions given by the trial judge are in
harmony, I think, with what has been said in numerous well known cases, which
have definitely established the rules that are to be followed in this country.

As early as in 1855 and even before, it was
decided in Regina v. Stubbs[7],
that the rule that a jury should not convict on the unsupported evidence of an
accomplice is a rule of practice only, and not a rule of law, and that a judge
should advise the jury to acquit unless the testimony of the accomplice be
corroborated, not only as to the circumstances of the offence, but also as to
the participation in it by the accused, and that where there are several
prisoners, and the accomplice is not confirmed as to all, the jury should be
directed to acquit the prisoners as to whom he is not confirmed; but it was
held that this rule being a rule of practice only, if a jury choose to act on
the unconfirmed testimony of the accomplice, the conviction cannot be quashed
as bad in law.

Later, in re Baskerville,[8] the Court of Criminal Appeal in England
decided at page 87:

There is no doubt that the uncorroborated
evidence of an accomplice is admissible in law. See Rex v. Atwood[9]. But it has long been a rule of practice at
common law for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting a
prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice or accomplices, and,
in the discretion of the judge, to advise them not to convict upon such
evidence; but the judge should point out to the jury that it is within their
legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence: Reg. v. Stubbs6;
In re Meunier,[10].

At page 91 in the same case, it is said:

We hold that evidence in corroboration must
be independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to
connect him with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which
implicates him, that is, which confirms in some material particular not only
the evidence that the crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner
committed it. The test applicable to determine the nature and extent of the
corroboration is thus the same whether the case falls within the rule of
practice at common law or within that class of offence for which corroboration
is required by statute. The language of the statute, “implicating the accused,”
compendiously incorporates the test applicable at common law in the rule of
practice. The nature of the corroboration will necessarily vary according to
the particular circumstances of the offence charged. It would be in a high
degree dangerous to attempt to formulate the kind of evidence which would be
regarded as corrobora-

[Page 97]

tion, except to say that corroborative
evidence is evidence which shews or tends to shew that the story of the
accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true, not merely that the
crime has been committed, but that it was committed by the accused.

The corroboration need not be direct
evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely
circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime. A good instance of
this indirect evidence is to be found in Reg. v. Birkett[11].

Reference may also be made to the Beebe case[12]; Gouin v. The King[13]; Hubin v. The King[14]; Vigeant v. The King[15].

The jury had, therefore, several alternatives.
They could reach the conclusion that Shorting and Wilkinson were not
accomplices, and convict on their uncorroborated evidence. It was open to them
to believe that Wilkinson and Shorting were in no way connected with the
robbery and with the imprisoning of Butcher, and that although they both might
have violated the provincial liquor laws of Ontario, or might be a party to the
receiving of the stolen goods, they were not implicated in the armed robbery
and kidnapping. The offence of receiving stolen goods is a different offence
from the one for which the appellant was charged. It has been said that under
common law, the receipt of stolen goods did not constitute the receiver an
accessory to the theft, but was a distinct misdemeanour punishable by fine and
imprisonment. (Archibald’s Criminal Pleadings Evidence and Practice, 28th
edition, p. 1463).

In Rex v. Dumont[16], Mr. Justice Hodgins said:

I cannot regard the widow as an accomplice.
The test is: could she have been indicted under the wide provisions of our Code
for the offence for which the prisoner has been convicted? If she could, then
any spectator of a crime might find himself described as an accomplice, for
here she only saw the first blow struck and later witnessed the carrying out of
her husband.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v.
Zocanno and Burleigh[17] said:

On a charge of breaking and entering, a
witness who was found in possession of some of the stolen property, and who
subsequently became an accomplice of the accused in other crimes in connection
with the disposition of some of the stolen property, is not an accomplice in
respect of the crime charged.

[Page 98]

It is quite unnecessary to examine the soundness
of these decisions. But the only ground, upon which they could possibly be
challenged, is that the possession of recently stolen goods is evidence upon
which a jury may convict of theft, but this possession creates a mere
presumption, and here, there is ample evidence to justify a jury to say that
the presumption has been rebutted. Rex v. Watson[18]; Baker v. The King[19].

The jury could also take the view that Shorting
or Wilkinson was an accomplice, and that the other was not. Then, they could
properly find the corroboration of one witness in the testimony of the other.

Another course the jury could follow was that,
even if both were accomplices, they could convict without corroboration, having
been on that point properly instructed by the trial judge. They knew that this
was a dangerous practice to follow, but it was within their province to do so
and to believe Shorting and Wilkinson.

Lastly, if they did rely on corroboration in
view of the warning given by the judge, because they believed Shorting and
Wilkinson to be accomplices, they had independent circumstantial evidence which
was of an incriminating nature. The presence of the appellant with the
perpetrators of the crime in his own apartment, and his association with them,
a few hours after the robbery, was a circumstance from which the jury could
reasonably draw the inference, that Shorting and Wilkinson were speaking the
truth when they swore that MacDonald was in the barn helping to unload the
stolen liquor. It was also for them to believe that MacDonald would not have
been present at that meeting if he was not linked in some material way with the
others who have been found guilty.

Another most extraordinary circumstance is that,
when heard as a witness in his own defence, MacDonald swore that all these
people gathered in his apartment after the robbery, the unloading of the stolen
liquor and the imprisonment of Butcher, did not mention among themselves the
stolen liquor. This statement could be regarded as implausible by the jury, and
as not being an expression of the truth. The jury saw and heard MacDonald, and

[Page 99]

from his demeanour, and from what they had the
right to believe as being an absence of reasonableness, they could draw their
own conclusions.

The behaviour of a witness as well as his
contradictory, or untrue statements are questions of fact from which a jury may
properly infer corroboration.

In The King v. Christie,[20] Lord Moulton said:

The evidential value of the occurrence
depends entirely on the behaviour of the prisoner, for the fact that some one
makes a statement to him subsequently to the commission of the crime cannot in
itself have any value as evidence for or against him. The only evidence for or
against him is his behaviour in response to the charge, but I can see no
justification for laying down as a rule of law that any particular form of
response, whether of a positive or negative character, is such that it cannot
in some circumstances have an evidential value. I am, therefore, of opinion
that there is no rule of law that evidence cannot be given of the accused being
charged with the offence and of his behaviour on hearing such charge where that
behaviour amounts to a denial of his guilt.

In Mash v. Barley,[21] Kennedy L.J. said:

I also agree that there may be cases in
which language, whether used in a Court of justice or outside a Court of
justice, may be considered as having the effect of corroboration, although
there is nothing like an express admission. There may be such cases.

Under the circumstances of this case, I think
that the jury could properly conclude that the meeting in MacDonald’s apartment
after the robbery, with the others who were since convicted, and his denial of
any reference to the stolen liquor, were facts from which the jury, if they
chose, could find elements of corroboration of Shorting’s and Wilkinson’s
evidence. In view of the evidence adduced, these circumstances could be found
consistent with appellant’s guilt and inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion.

The second ground raised by the appellant is that
counsel for the Crown, in his address to the jury, read a part of the reasons
for judgment of Mr. Justice McRuer, in the first appeal. Mr. Justice
McRuer had said:

The evidence of Shorting, it was argued,
ought not to have been received while the charge of receiving was pending
against him. I cannot agree with this contention. Nor do I think there was any
impropriety in presenting the evidence of Shorting under the circumstances.
Crown Counsel has a duty to offer to the Court such evidence as is available
bearing on the charge in question. In many cases it is not only necessary but
the duty of the Crown Counsel to call witnesses of low repute

[Page 100]

and against whom a charge may be pending.
In the case of appeal it would have been quite impractical to have proceeded
against Shorting on the charge of receiving until the accused had been tried on
the principal charge.

It is argued that the reading of this extract
was improper and amounted to a mistrial, because it dealt with the credibility
of Shorting as a witness, which was a vital issue of the trial. It is submitted
that anything Mr. Justice McRuer said was not the opinion of the Court, and
that if such extracts were read, the different opinions of other judges on the
same point should also have been communicated to the jury.

The question would be different, if in fact
Mr. Justice McRuer had said anything that would tend to create a
favourable impression as to Shorting’s credibility; but I find nothing of that
kind in that part of the judgment that was read to the jury. Obviously, Miss
Parsons, counsel for the appellant, had attacked the propriety of calling
Shorting as a witness and it was owing only to the position in which the Crown
had found itself at the time of the first trial that Mr. Justice McRuer
referred. I am unable to find anything in these remarks that can be interpreted
as praising Shorting’s credibility. The indirect reference to Shorting, who was
the Crown’s main incriminating witness against the appellant, as a man of “low
repute and against whom a charge may be pending” is surely not a vindication of
his credibility as a witness. I am far from agreeing with the proposition that
the Crown should call in all circumstances a person as a witness while a
criminal charge is outstanding against him, or with the propriety of Crown
counsel reading the judgment of a judge who had taken part in the hearing of
the previous appeal, but the reading of what Mr. Justice McRuer had said
involves no miscarriage of justice.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was
delivered by

RAND J.—The first ground of challenge to the
conviction was the direction of the trial judge that the meeting in the
apartment of the accused within four or five hours of the unloading of the
liquor in the barn could be taken

[Page 101]

as corroboration of the evidence given by
Shorting. There were present at that time Mancuso, Baskett and Edwin MacDonald,
who were afterwards convicted of the robbery, two admitted bootleggers and the
accused, himself a gambler and a bootlegger. Edwin MacDonald is a brother of
the accused and Baskett is married to a step-sister of a woman who lives with
the accused. The car in which the truck‑driver was kidnapped was owned by
the father-in-law of Baskett. It is not clear just how long they had been
together before the detective arrived, shortly after one o’clock. When he
entered, Baskett, Edwin MacDonald and a bootlegger, Taylor, were in the bedroom
just off the living room, with MacDonald lying on the bed; in the living room
were Mancuso, the bootlegger Applebaum, and the accused, talking to Applebaum.
He was described as being under the influence of liquor, with an appearance of
having been up all night. On the stand, he gave reasons for the presence of the
different persons in his home and denied that the liquor had been mentioned.
These explanations and this denial, in the setting in which they were offered,
could have been accepted only by very credulous persons.

It is argued that the presence of these men,
characterized by the circumstances indicated, was as consistent with innocence
as with guilt; that either the gathering was mere coincidence or that the
thieves might have made use of the apartment to arrange for disposing of the
liquor without any previous knowledge on the part of the accused. Considering
all of the evidence bearing upon it, including an adverse inference from
disbelief in the improbable testimony of the accused, I am unable to treat the
incident as being neutral in its probative effect; that the jury could find a
balance of probability tending to connect him with the robbery seems to me to
be perfectly clear; and no more is necessary, Thomas v. Jones[22]. The direction was, therefore, well
founded, and on this ground the appeal must fail.

Then in his address, the Crown Prosecutor
introduced a quotation from the judgment of McRuer J.A. in the appeal from the
first conviction, which dealt with the pro-

[Page 102]

priety of offering Shorting as a witness when
there was a charge pending against him which had been the subject of twelve
adjournments, in these words:

Now, fortunately, in this very case one of
the Justices of Appeal made some comments on the propriety of the crown acting
as they did with regard to Shorting. The evidence of Shorting, it was argued, “ought
not to have been received while the charge of receiving was pending against
him. I cannot agree with this contention.” This is what the Justice said: I was
there. “nor do I think there was any impropriety in presenting the evidence of
Shorting under the circumstances. Crown Counsel has a duty to offer to the
Court such evidence as is available bearing on the charge in question. In many
cases it is not only necessary but the duty of the Crown is to call witnesses
of low repute and against whom a charge may be pending. In the case in appeal
it would have been quite impractical to have proceeded against Shorting on the
charge of receiving until the accused had been tried on the principal charge.”

Evidence of these and subsequent adjournments
was introduced at the second trial and we are told, and it is not questioned,
that, in her address, Miss Parsons stressed rigorously the importance of
Shorting’s evidence and the possible effect upon him of those circumstances
followed by the withdrawal of the preliminary proceeding against him in 1945, a
few weeks before the second trial.

There is no doubt the quotation ought not to
have been made; it was wholly irrelevant to the matters before the jury; and if
I could bring myself to the view that it might have influenced them in making
up their minds on the credibility of Shorting, I would not hesitate to hold
with Laidlaw J.A. that it was an impropriety to be cured only by a new trial.
But when the language is carefully examined in the background of the
suggestions of counsel, its application to Shorting is really derogatory; it is
simply a statement by a judge of what should be obvious to an ordinary juryman;
and I do not think its effect can be taken to have been more than to bring
forcibly to their minds the fact that in criminal prosecutions of the order in
question the Crown more often than not is compelled by the necessities of the
case to offer witnesses with character or reputation possessing little to
commend them to belief. This ground fails then likewise.

The appeal should therefore be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA
SCOTIA EN BANC

Criminal law—Trial on charge of rape—Question
whether trial judge should have charged jury as to possible alternative
findings of lesser offence—Question whether failure of accused to testify was
made subject of comment, contrary to Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 59,
s. 4 (5).

The appeal was from the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc dismissing appeal from appellant's
conviction on a charge of rape. The appeal to this Court was on two questions
of law on which there was dissent in said Court en banc, in connection
with the trial Judge's charge to the jury, it being contended: (1) He erred in
failing to instruct them as to possible alternative findings of a lesser
offence, there being evidence to warrant such a finding. (The trial Judge
withdrew from the jury a count of indecent assault contained in the indictment
and stated, according to an affidavit offered to the Court en banc, that
they ""must find a verdict of rape or nothing""; and he directed his
charge only to the count of rape). (2) The failure of the accused to testify
was made the subject of comment, contrary to s. 4 (5) of the Canada Evidence
Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 59. (The trial Judge stated: ""* * * You heard the
story of this woman * * * and her evidence is not denied * * * I can see
nothing in the conduct of this woman that day, according to her evidence—and
that is the only evidence we have as to her conduct excepting the other
witnesses that came in here to tell the `story of what she told them * * * It
was his doing, according to the evidence and the only evidence we have * *
*"").

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed (Taschereau J. dissented).

Per the Chief
Justice, Kerwin and Hudson, JJ.: As to the first contention: On the evidence (discussed),
the only evidence of the actual commission of the crime, on which the jury
could reasonably have returned a verdict of guilty, pointed only to rape, if
the jury believed the victim's story, or not guilty, if they did not believe
her; and the trial Judge's charge in this respect was justified. As to the
second contention: The trial Judge's remarks complained of could not be taken
to have had any effect on the jury as being a comment obnoxious to s. 4 (5)  of
the Canada Evidence Act . (It was remarked that said words ""her
evidence is not denied"" were no doubt referring to statements made by the
victim, after the occurrence, to other persons, who gave evidence) (Rex v.
Gallagher, 37 Can. Cr.
C. 83, and Bigaouette v. The King, [1927] S.C.R. 112, discussed and
distinguished. Opinion expressed that the latter case went as far on the
subject in question as this Court would care to go).

[Page 320]

Per Taschereau
J., dissenting: As to the first contention (the second one is not dealt with):
It was open to the jury upon the evidence to find, if they saw fit, that the
accused was guilty only of an attempt to commit rape (a lesser offence included
in the major charge of rape), and the failure of the trial Judge to instruct
them that such a verdict was open to them and that it was within their power to
find the accused guilty of a reduced offence was fatal to the legality of the
verdict, and therefore the conviction should be quashed and a new trial
directed. (The facts were not sufficiently clear to allow an appellate court to
substitute, for the verdict found by the jury, a verdict of guilty of a lesser
offence, as may be done in certain cases under s. 1016  of the Criminal Code ).

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia en banc dismissing appeal from the conviction of
appellant, at trial before Carroll J. and a jury, on a charge of rape. There
was dissent in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc on certain
questions of law in connection with the trial Judge's charge to the jury, which
questions are set out and discussed in the reasons for judgment in this Court
now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed, Taschereau J. dissenting.

R. A. Ritchie for the appellant.

R. M. Fielding K.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin and
Hudson JJ. was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—The appellant was, by a jury, found guilty of
rape and, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sitting, en banc, affirmed
his conviction.

In the order dismissing the appeal, Smiley J. is
stated to have dissented on questions of law, to wit:—

(1) That the learned trial Judge erred in
failing to instruct the jury as to possible alternative verdicts.

(2) That the failure of the person charged to
testify was made the subject of comment by the learned trial Judge contrary to
Section 4, sub-section. 5, of the Canada Evidence Act .

On the first point. Although Doull J., who sat
in the Court of Appeal, is not stated in the formal judgment to have actually
dissented, if we look at the learned Judge's reasons we find that, as he
expressed it:—

Giving the accused the benefit of every
argument, I proceed to give effect to the doubtful opinion which I have that
the verdict of an attempt

[Page 321]

was open to the jury. No reasonable jury
could in my opinion have found a verdict of anything less than attempted rape
and it seems to me that a new trial is a most undesirable outcome of this
prosecution.

On the actual findings, it appears that the
jury must have been satisfied of facts which proved the accused at least guilty
of an attempt. The court should therefore substitute a verdict of guilty of
attempted rape and pass a sentence of four years' imprisonment in Dorchester
Penitentiary.

We take that to be a dissenting opinion by Doull
J.; more particularly since the sentence against the appellant on the charge as
brought was for five years. The point would be in respect of the failure of the
learned trial Judge to charge the jury as to lesser offences. In the opinion of
Smiley J., ""there was evidence in this case from which the jury might
reasonably have inferred that the accused was guilty of a lesser offence, not
necessarily that contained in the second count"". The learned Judge
referred to Sections 949  and 951  of the Criminal Code , which read as
follows:—

949. When the complete commission of an
offence charged is not proved but the evidence establishes an attempt to commit
the offence, the accused may be convicted of such attempt and punished
accordingly.

951. Every count shall be deemed divisible;
and if the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment
creating the offence or as charged in the count, includes the commission of any
other offence, the person accused may be convicted of any offence so included
which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved; or he may be
convicted of an attempt to commit any offence so included.

We omit paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 951 ,
as they deal with counts charging murder, or manslaughter, and have no
application here.

The indictment in the present case contained two
counts, the first being that of rape, and the second that of indecent assault.
The learned trial Judge withdrew from the consideration of the jury the second
count in the indictment and directed his charge to the first count only, on
which the jury returned a verdict of guilty.

It is said that the trial Judge, when he
announced that he was withdrawing the count of indecent assault from the jury,
added that he ""was going to instruct them that they must find a verdict of
rape or nothing"", and that counsel should confine himself to the question
of rape. This is based on an affidavit offered to the Court of Appeal by Mr.
Norman D. Murray, Barrister at Law, who acted

[Page 322]

as counsel for the appellant upon his trial.
Nothing to that effect is to be found in the charge itself; but, as two of the
learned Judges of Appeal based their dissenting opinions on that point, we
think we ought to consider it in the present judgment.

The contention is that, by force of Sections 949 
and 951 , reproduced above, a jury properly instructed might have found the
accused guilty only of an attempt to commit the offence, or of the lesser
offence of indecent assault, notwithstanding that the latter charge was already
contained in the second count of the indictment and the learned trial Judge had
withdrawn that count from the jury.

The only evidence at the trial pointing to the
guilt of the accused was as to his being guilty of the crime of rape. That was
the story of the victim, Mrs. Myrna D. Bosma.

No doubt in a crime such as the one under
consideration, the initial step might be stated to be an indecent assault,
followed by the subsequent step which might be described as an attempt to rape;
but, when once the rape is stated to have taken place, there no longer remains
any question of indecent assault, or attempted rape, if the story of the victim
is believed.

In her testimony, Mrs. Bosma definitely states
that she was raped by the appellant. In the words of Sir Joseph Chisholm,
C.J.:—

She said the appellant had tried to rape
her—a quite correct statement—and she followed that answer with the direct
statement that he did commit the offence of rape. I do not think that any jury
could reasonably, from the fragment on which the contention is based, conclude
that the offence was merely an attempt, nor do I think that the first answer
should be weighed in isolation from the second. It was as if she exclaimed in
her excitement: ""He tried to rape me and he succeeded"".

It is true that when she was on her way back to Halifax she told Mr. Murdock Bell, who
testified to that effect:—""She said she had been attacked"". But, of
course, it was not to be expected that she would, in her conversation with Mr.
Bell, go into the details of what had taken place and the word
""attacked"" is quite apt to include the fact of the rape itself.

Then when the victim spoke to her housekeeper,
Mrs. Marion Marriott, she first mentioned that the appellant had
""mistreated her"". Mrs. Marriott was then asked whether the victim
described the mistreatment in any way,

[Page 323]

and she said that she did and that the
description which she gave of the mistreatment was ""that he had tried to
rape her"". The next question was:—""Did she say that he did?"",
and the answer is ""Yes, after she was upstairs, she said that he
did."" Again the question is put to Mrs. Marriott:—""And she said that
he had raped her?"", and the answer is ""Yes"".

Even if the testimony of Mr. Bell and of Mrs.
Marriott was to be taken as evidence of the commission of the offence itself,
it will be seen that in both instances the statements made by Mrs. Bosma to
them could not convey the idea that the accused had stopped at mere indecent
assault, or at attempted rape, but, on the contrary, they would tend to show
that actual rape was consummated. But it is not to be forgotten that Mrs.
Bosnia's statements, either to Mr. Bell or to her landlady, were not admissible
for the purpose of proving the crime; they were merely evidence of the
complaints subsequently made by Mrs. Bosma in order to show that her acts and
statements after the commission of the offence were consistent with her
evidence as to the actual facts that had taken place at the appellant's house
on the occasion where rape is alleged to have been committed by the appellant
upon Mrs. Bosma.

So that the only evidence there is in the record
of the actual commission of the crime, on which the jury could reasonably have
returned a verdict of guilty, pointed only to rape, if they believed the story
of Mrs. Bosma, or not guilty, if they did not believe her.

We, therefore, think that the learned trial
Judge, even if he did not actually say so in his charge, was justified in
withdrawing from the jury the count relating to indecent assault, and also in
telling the jury that, in the circumstances shown in the evidence properly
admissible, the only verdict could be either guilty of rape or not guilty. This
was the view of the majority of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, and
we cannot agree with the learned dissenting Judges that, in doing what he did,
the learned trial Judge erred in such a way as to justify the contention that
the jury might have found the accused guilty of a lesser offence and that, on
account of this failure, a new trial should be ordered.

[Page 324]

Dealing now with the second point. The portions
of the charge, to which objection is made, are as follows:—

Now, he is charged with rape and I tried to
define what rape is to you. You heard the story of this woman, who came on the
witness stand here, and her evidence is not denied.

And later the trial Judge said:—

Now Gentlemen, I am not going into the
sordid things that took place there, but I can see nothing in the conduct of
this woman that day, according to her evidence—and that is the only evidence we
have as to her conduct excepting the other witnesses that came in here to tell
the story of what she told them—I see nothing in her conduct that day that
should make the jury detract from the truth of anything that she said.

And then again:—

It was his doing, according to the evidence
and the only evidence we have * * *

On that point, as already stated, the majority
of the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the remarks complained of do not
in effect amount to such comment that they may be regarded as obnoxious to the
statutory direction.

Doull J., in that regard, in the course of his
reasons, said:—

I certainly dissent from any pronouncement
that a statement of a judge that certain evidence is ""not denied"" or
is ""uncontradicted"" without more is a sufficient ground for setting
aside a verdict. The words ""subject of comment"" mean something more
than a reference to evidence as ""uncontradicted"". There must be
something which pointedly draws the attention of the jury to the fact that
there is evidence which the accused could give and which he has failed to give.

For his dissenting opinion on that point, Smiley
J. relied on the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta in Rex v. Gallagher[1], and on
the judgment of this Court in Bigaouette v. The King[2]. He also said that in the Bigaouette case
a certain part of the statement of Stuart J.A. in the Gallagher case was
quoted with approval in this Court.

In the Gallagher case (1), the trial
Judge in his charge to the jury suggested that evidence ought to have been
given which only the accused could have given. The actual words by him were (p.
85):—

Now then, though we have the evidence which
we have that the defendant was the last person seen in the company of the
murdered man, the circumstantial evidence that he was killed at a certain time
after-

[Page 325]

wards and the circumstantial evidence as to
the possession of these bullets and the possession of the firearm or firearms
and that is not denied by the defendant, it would still seem to leave room for
a reasonable doubt as to whether or not he was the person who committed this
crime ……

There is no suggestion of anything else, he
either went down that path towards his own home or he went on with the car and
there is no suggestion from the defence or any other person that he could have
gone any other way.

It will be seen that there the trial Judge in
his charge to the jury offended, unwittingly no doubt, against the provision
contained in subsection (5)  of Section 4  of the Canada Evidence Act  that:—

The failure of the person charged * * * to
testify, shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge * * *

There the defendant, in the first part of the
portion of the charge objected to, was specifically mentioned, and in the
second part of it was referred to in such a way that it could not apply to
anybody else but the defendant.

In the Bigaouette case[3], the learned trial Judge said:—

Le docteur Marois a fait l'autopsie à trois
heures et quart, et si vous croyez son témoignage (c'est un homme dont le
témoignage a du poids), il a déclaré que la mort avait dû arriver à sept
heures, ou à six heures et même avant, du matin.

Voilà les circonstances qui enveloppent la
mort de la défunte.

Si la mort, mes amis, remonte à six heures
ou à sept heures du matin, où était l'accusé à ce moment-là, vers sept heures
ou six heures du matin, même plus à bonne heure? A la maison. A la maison, car,
d'après sa propre déclaration, il n'est sorti qu'à huit heures du matin.

Il était donc seul avec sa mère à la maison
quand la mort est arrivée et si l'accusé était seul avec sa mère quand elle a
été tuée et égorgée, la défense aurait dû être capable d'expliquer par qui ce
meurtre a été commis. Car une pareille boucherie n'a pas dû se faire, sans que
l'accusé en eut connaissance.

As was said by Duff J., as he then was,
delivering the judgment of the Court:—

It seems to be reasonably clear that,
according to the interpretation which would appear to the jury as the more
natural and probable one, the comment implied in this passage upon the failure
of la défense to explain who committed the murder would, having regard
to the circumstances emphasized by the learned trial judge, be this, namely,
that it related to the failure of the accused to testify upon that subject at
the trial. It is conceivable., of course, that such language might be
understood as relating to a failure to give an explanation to police officers
or others; but the language of the charge is so easily and naturally capable of
being understood in the other way, that it seems plainly obnoxious to the
enactment referred to, subs. 5 of s. 4, R.S.C., c. 145.

[Page 326]

Smiley J., as already adverted to, said that the
latter part of the statement of Stuart J.A., in Rex v. Gallagher[4] had been approved by this Court in the Bigaouette
case[5], but
the words which were approved as correctly stating the law are quoted in the
judgment of this Court and they only expressed a general view of the law
without in any way applying them to the particular facts of the Gallagher case
(1). They are merely to the effect that, even if the language used is just as
capable of one meaning as the other, the position would be that the jury would
be just as likely to take the words in the sense in which it was forbidden to
use them, as in the innocuous sense, and in such circumstance the error was
thought fatal.

We have nothing of the kind here. The accused
appellant was no where mentioned in those portions of the charge which are
objected to. In the last two paragraphs above mentioned the only statement in
the charge is that the evidence of the victim is ""the only evidence we
have""; and, as to the first statement: ""her evidence is not
denied"", the learned Judge no doubt was referring there to the fact that,
in the course of Mrs. Bosnia's evidence, she said that on her way back to
Halifax she had told Mr. Bell that she had been attacked and Mr. Bell confirmed
that; also that when she reached her house she had told Mrs. Marriott that she
had been mistreated and had described such mistreatment by saying that the appellant
""had tried to rape her"" and ""she said that he did"". Not
only was that not denied, but it was confirmed by Mrs. Marriott.

We think the Bigaouette case5
certainly goes as far on that subject as this Court would care to go and, like
the majority of the Court of Appeal, we are unable to find that the remarks
here complained of could have any effect on the jury as being a comment
""obnoxious to the statutory direction"".

We think, therefore, that the appeal should be
dismissed.

Taschereau J. (dissenting)—The appellant was indicted for rape and indecent
assault. In the course of the address of defendant's counsel, the presiding
Judge withdrew the count of indecent assault, and left the jury with the only

[Page 327]

alternative of finding the accused
""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" of rape. A verdict of
""guilty"" was returned, and the appellant was sentenced to five years
in the penitentiary.

His appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
was dismissed, Justices Doull and Smiley dissenting. The former thought that a
verdict of attempted rape was open to the jury, and was of opinion that such a
verdict should be substituted to the one given by the jury. The latter reached
the conclusion that there was evidence from which the jury might reasonably
have inferred that the accused was guilty of a lesser offence, nor necessarily
that contained in the second count, and he was also of opinion that certain
comments made by the trial Judge might have been considered by the jury as
relating to the failure of the accused to testify. He would have granted a new
trial.

Before this Court, it is submitted on behalf of
the appellant that the learned trial Judge erred in failing to instruct the
jury as to possible alternative verdicts, and that the failure of the appellant
to testify was made the subject of comment in the charge to the jury.

It is undisputed and undisputable that the
offence of rape for which the appellant was charged, is one of those offences
which may be reduced, and that the accused, if the evidence does not warrant a
conviction for the major offence, may be found guilty of a lesser one. Under
the Criminal Code , (949-951), every count is deemed divisible, and when
the offence charged includes all the elements of a lesser offence, the person
accused may be convicted of the offence as charged, or may be convicted of an
attempt to commit the offence charged, or he may be convicted of the lesser
offence or of an attempt to commit it. In the case of rape, the possible
verdicts which in law may be found, are, therefore, attempted rape, indecent
assault, common assault, or attempt to commit one of these lesser offences. In
the case at bar, the charge of indecent assault in a separate count was quite
unnecessary, as it was included in the major charge of rape.

Of course, it cannot be contended that all these
intermediate verdicts are open to the jury in all cases. They will receive the
sanction of the courts only if there exists a foundation of facts which would
justify a reasonable jury, properly instructed, to reach such a conclusion. In

[Page 328]

other instances a trial Judge will, therefore,
be well advised to instruct the jury that the only possible verdict is
""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" of the major offence which is
charged, and that there is no room for any other finding.

The facts of each particular case must be
considered, but whenever there is evidence, the jury must be free to weigh it,
to consider it in the light of all the circumstances of the case, and all the
possible verdicts must be left open to them, even if it is unlikely that they
will reach some of them.

And if any authority is needed to substantiate
these propositions, I may refer to the cases of The King v. Hughes[6]; The King v. Hopper[7]; Rex v. Roberts[8].

It follows that it is the imperative duty of the
trial Judge to instruct the jury as to all the verdicts which they have the
right to find, and that he may not impose his personal views upon them, by
withdrawing from their consideration certain verdicts which they could reach if
they accepted a certain view of the facts as revealed by the evidence that
would reasonably justify them to find the accused guilty of a lesser offence.

In the present case, I do not find it necessary
to deal with the question of there being any evidence on which the jury might
find indecent or common assault. A graver offence may have been committed, but
I strongly disagree with the view that it was necessarily rape, and that the
jury, if left free, had not before them the necessary foundation of facts to
reach the conclusion, if they found fit, that the appellant was guilty of
attempted rape. I do not say that such would have been their verdict, but I am
of opinion that it was for them to decide.

It fell within their province after weighing the
surrounding circumstances of the evidence, to say if all the necessary steps
towards the full execution of the criminal purpose had been completed, or if
they were interrupted before the act, which the appellant had in mind, had been
totally accomplished within the meaning of the Criminal Code . If this last
hypothesis had been accepted by the jury, a verdict of attempt to commit rape
could not have been qualified as perverse and would have undoubtedly been left
undisturbed by the courts, if challenged by the Crown.

[Page 329]

But the jury were not instructed that such a
verdict was open to them, and that it was within their power to find the
appellant guilty of a reduced offence. The failure to give such a direction
was, I think, fatal to the legality of the verdict, and it should therefore be
quashed. In view of this conclusion, it is useless to discuss the second point
raised by the appellant.

Section 1016 , Cr. Code, is drafted in
terms broad enough to allow a court of appeal in certain cases, to substitute
for the verdict found a verdict of guilty of a lesser offence. But I do not
think that in the present case such a course should be followed. I am not
satisfied that the facts are sufficiently clear to allow me to make such a
substitution, without assuming the role which belongs exclusively to the jury.
This course may be adopted when it appears to a court of appeal that the jury
must have been satisfied of facts which proved the accused guilty of the lesser
offence, but such a situation does not arise in the present case.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and direct a new trial.

Rand J.—I concur in dismissing the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION

Criminal law—Negligence—Child drowned in oil well—Charge
against owner of failing to guard the well adequately—Criminal Code , ss. 247 ,
284 , 287  (b)—Child a trespasser—Duty and responsibility of owner of well.

[Page 191]

The appeal was from the conviction of appellant by the
Appellate Division, Alberta, [1944] 2 W.W.R. 503 (which set aside the judgment
of acquittal at trial), under ss. 247 , 284  and 287  (b) of the Criminal
Code , of failing to guard adequately the cellar of an oil well of
appellant, in consequence whereof a child of tender years was drowned therein.
The well was not, and for some time had not been, in use, and there had been
erected a structure around and over it as a guard against danger. The child, in
company with other children, had climbed on the structure and in walking along
was accidentally pushed off by an older boy into the water below.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of
acquittal at trial restored.

Per the Chief Justice and Rand J.: Sees. 247 and 284
embody the common law rule and, under them, apart from s. 287 , appellant could
not in the circumstances be held criminally responsible for the accident. The
child was a trespasser. Children were not tolerated about the well, there was
no practice of playing there, and on the occasions

[Page 192]

when a few played there, they were, if
seen, warned off by the owner's employees, chiefly because of danger from gas
and fire and the pressure in the pipes. There was no object of fascination
alluring children nor active conduct by the owner in disregard of children's
known or necessarily apprehended presence. In such circumstances the rule at
common law that (with certain exceptions not present here) an owner of land is
entitled to do with it what he pleases, and that trespassers move at their own
risk and peril, is as applicable to children as to adults (Holland v. Lanarkshire,
1909 Sess. Cas. 1142, and other cases, cited). As to s. 287  (b),
assuming the excavation here to be within its scope, what is there
contemplated, as indicated by its language, is the prevention of injury from
hidden openings; the required fence or guard must protect the unwary; but when
the existence of the opening is made evident (as in this case) the purpose of
the fence or guard is accomplished; the owner must protect the trespasser on
the land from a trap, but he is not called on to protect against a subsequent
danger from trespassing on the guard itself raised against that trap; and the
scope of the duty is as limited in relation to children as to adults.

Per Kerwin and Estey JJ.: The evidence supports the
trial Judge's finding that the child was a trespasser; and, under the common
law rule, of which s. 247  of the Criminal Code  is a restatement,
appellant, in the circumstances of this case, would not be liable to
trespassers, including children (Hardy v. Central London Ry. Co., [1920]
3 K.B. 459, at 473, and other
cases, cited); the precautions taken and the warning and chasing away of children
exonerated appellant from any suggestion of intention to injure or trap or of
callous or wanton disregard of consequences.

As to respondent's contention (in the Appellate Division and
in this Court) that the facts disclosed an offence under s. 287  (b)
(under which the charge was not laid and which was not brought to the trial
Judge's attention) and that by virtue of ss. 951, 1013(5) and 1016(2) a
conviction should now be directed—It is doubtful if the offence under s. 287 
could, within the meaning of those sections, be an offence so included under s.
247 , both because of the essentials required to constitute the offence and
because it is a summary conviction rather than an indictable offence. Apart
from these considerations, the evidence did not disclose that an offence was
committed under s. 287 , as the excavation was so far guarded that instead of
accidentally falling therein within the meaning of s. 287  (b), the
children climbed over the barrier.

Per Taschereau J.: The Appellate Division erred in finding
a breach of the duty imposed by s. 287  (b). The duty imposed by
s. 287  (b) is to fence the excavation in such a manner that a
person riding, driving or walking shall not fall therein accidentally. It would
unduly stretch the scope of s. 287  (b) and do violence to its
text, to hold that the fence must be so built that entrance is impossible. What
is contemplated is to protect a motorist or pedestrian from a danger of which
he is unaware and which may accidentally cause his death; it does not apply to
the present case, where a trespasser succeeded in making his way to the
excavation where the danger was obvious and was accidentally pushed into the
water by a companion.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division[1], which
(setting aside the 3 judgment of
acquittal by Ives C.J.T.D.) convicted the present appellant

For that it * * * being then the owner and operator and having
under its charge and control an oil or gas well * * * the maintaining whereof
in the absence of precaution or care, might endanger human life, and being
under a legal duty to take reasonable precautions against, and use reasonable
care to avoid, such danger, did omit, without lawful excuse, to perform such
duty in that it failed to place adequate fencing around or covering over the
cellar of the said well and did permit the said cellar to become full of water
and gas, with the result that the said opening was dangerous to members of the
public and particularly to children who might come on the said well site and in
consequence whereof one John Douglas Stevenson, a child of tender years, was
drowned as a result of falling into the said cellar.

for which offence it was adjudged that the present appellant
forfeit and pay to His Majesty the King the sum of $1,000.

J.J. Saucier for the appellant.

H. J. Wilson K.C. for the respondent

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Rand J. was delivered by

RAND J.—This is an appeal from a conviction for criminal
negligence under sections 247  and
284  of the Criminal Code . The
negligence was charged as permitting an oil well not then in use to remain
unfenced or otherwise guarded, as a result of which a young child of about four
years of age was drowned.

The well was approximately 250
feet from a highway and some greater distance from a small number of
occupied houses. It had been temporarily discontinued under a conservation
order issued by the provincial government. Centered around it was a pit ten
feet square and eleven feet or so below the ground level, boxed in apparently
to a distance of about two feet above the ground. It was within a larger area
set with concrete pillars at the corners, four or five feet high. Between the
pillars, on the north and south sides, were concrete walls about two feet in
height. Supported on them were two large stringers twenty-four inches square
running north and south about four feet apart and passing over

[Page 194]

the pit approximately one foot from each
side. Lying longitudinally on each was a timber fourteen inches square. Across
these was another lying transversely over the pit about two feet from the
northerly side and extending well towards the sides of the larger square. From
the east there was a sloping mound of earth which approached the northerly
concrete pillar to within a few inches of its side and about one and a half
feet from its top. Two loose planks lay across the easterly pillars, the inner
of which passed close to the end of the transverse timber over the pit. In the
pit was about nine feet of water, the surface of which was then seven feet or
so from the top of the timbers. Access to this top could be gained by going up
the mound from the east, onto the pillar and then by means of the planks to the
timbers. The size of the opening into the pit inside the timbers was
approximately six feet in length by four feet in width.

The young child had made his way to the top in company with three
other children, two boys aged seven and eight years and a young girl of six,
and in walking along was accidentally pushed off by the oldest boy into the
water below. The other boy fell in also but he was able to save himself.

The well had been brought in about twelve years before and had
been closed down for a year and a half. Children had from time to time played
about it and in several instances had been seen by employees of the appellant.
One of these latter had brought what he considered the danger of the well to
the attention of the manager. He was prompted to this by a recent loss of two
grandchildren by drowning; and with the permission of the manager he had
secured the well by means of boards and fencing in a manner which he thought
sufficient for all reasonable purposes. This was in the autumn of 1941. He
considered the top of the structure—the timbers—to be beyond the reach of
children too small to look after themselves. No doubt the well with its pillars
and beams carried some degree of attraction to children from a point where they
had a right to be, but in the local surroundings probably any visible structure
would have done so. A small quantity of gas bubbled out through the water, but
this could be seen only at the well.

[Page 195]

The trial judge dismissed the charge. On appeal the court found
the accused guilty under the sections mentioned by reason of a breach of the duty
prescribed by section 287  (b), and a fine of $1,000 was imposed;

Sections 247  and 284  embody the Common Law rule and, under them,
apart from section 287 , the owners of the well could not in the circumstances
have been held criminally responsible for the tragic mishap. The trial judge
found the child to be a trespasser on the land and I do not see how he could
have done otherwise. Trespass does not depend on intention. If I walk upon my
neighbour's land, I am a trespasser even though I believe it to be my own, and
this rule is as applicable to children as to adults. There was no evidence of
license: that goes to the mind of the licensor either actual or as drawn from
his actions. But here there was not only no willingness on the part of the
owner that the children should play on this property but unequivocal
demonstration to the contrary. Although children had, over the twelve years,
played occasionally about the well, their numbers were few, they did not make a
practice of it and, whenever seen by employees of the owners, they had been
warned off, in one case somewhat vigorously. What was done made it perfectly
clear that they were not being tolerated about the well. This was not wholly or
even chiefly because of any special danger from the exposed pit, but rather the
danger from gas and fire and the pressures in the pipes.

With certain exceptions, not present here, an owner of land is
entitled, at common law, to do with it what he pleases: Jordin v. Crump[2];
trespassers move at their own risk and peril; and in the absence of an object
of fascination drawing children to their injury or of active conduct by the
owner in disregard of their known, or necessarily apprehended, presence, that
rule is as applicable to them as to adults. No such allurement was present
here, nor is the case within the second qualification of the rule.

The facts are almost identical with those present in Holland
v. Lanarkshire Middle Ward District Committee[3].
There the defendants were the owners of a piece of ground which contained a disused
and unfenced quarry,

[Page 196]

with high and precipitous banks and
containing water, at one point, eleven feet deep. A young child six years of
age had gained access to the quarry through a defective fence from a strip of
waste ground on which children were in the habit of playing. The child was
drowned but the Court of Session held that no duty on the part of the owner had
been shown. In the language of the Lord President (Lord Dunedin):

It is a new and unheard of proposition that, if you have
something on your ground as to which there is no duty of fencing, and someone
else makes use of his ground in some particular way, a duty is thereby imposed
upon you of doing what you were under no duty to do before, a duty, namely, of
fencing. I know of no authority for such a proposition. The quarry here was old
and disused long before this strip of ground had become open to the use of the
children, and that, I think, ends the question.

And in this respect the law of England is
the same as that of Scotland (Addie's case[4]).
Cleasby, B., ruled to the same effect in a prosecution for manslaughter of the
owner of an abandoned coal mine down the open shaft of which a trespasser had
accidentally fallen: Reg. v. Gratrex[5].

But the conviction is placed on a violation of the duty imposed
by section 287 (b) of the Code, which is as follows:

287. Every one is guilty of an offence and liable, on
summary conviction, to a fine or imprisonment with or without hard labour, or
both, who

* * * * * *

(b) being the owner, manager or superintendent of any
abandoned or unused mine or quarry or property upon or in which there is any
excavation of a sufficient area and depth to endanger human life, leaves the
same unguarded and uninclosed by a guard or fence of sufficient height and strength
to prevent any person from accidentally riding, driving, walking or falling
therein.

Harvey, C.J., delivering the judgment of
the Court, 'considered this language to be so precise in its delineation of the
duty as to exclude any question of degree of fault or lack of care, and in
effect to require such a fence or guard as must in any event prevent a person
from falling into the well or opening; and in the case of young children, this
would take into account their natural and likely behaviour in such situations
as a circumstance to be anticipated in the measures of security taken.

[Page 197]

But, assuming the excavation here to be within the scope of the
subsection, does that interpretation pay sufficient I regard to the purpose of
the legislation as indicated by the language, ""to prevent any person from accidentally
riding, driving, walking or falling therein""? What is contemplated is
the prevention of injury from hidden openings; the fence or guard must protect
the unwary; but when the existence of the opening is made evident, the purpose
of the fence or guard is accomplished. The owner must protect the trespasser on
the land from a trap, but he is not called on to protect against a subsequent
danger from trespassing on the guard itself raised against that trap. The duty
is not to prevent a person from falling into an opening but from falling in
""accidentally"", that is, accidental as to the existence of the thing
holding the threat. It is to safeguard against a concealed danger; but if the
thing becomes known, it ceases to be the accidental circumstance; and the
accidental may, as here, become a consequential circumstance, as the jostling
of the older boy in the course of walking on the guarding structure.

A young child may not, of course, appreciate the danger; but we
are dealing here with objective causation toward persons without rights: and
if, considering the object of the legislation, the scope of the duty is clear,
it is as limited in relation to a child as to a grown person. A child, as he
plays or trudges over a field, may accidentally fall into an open shaft;
against this the owner must provide a safeguard. It is quite another matter
that the owner, otherwise blameless, should be called upon to afford physical
security against apparent dangers to children who ought not to be on his land
at all. Does such a rule protect the child within the precincts of his own
home? Is such a responsibility placed upon those charged with his care? It
would come as a shock to a parent to find himself guilty of manslaughter
because he had failed to provide barriers to keep his child from climbing into
a well in the farmyard.

The legislation is not specially intended for the protection of
children, and we cannot allow sympathy to stretch its scope. The conditions in
which we live bristle with hazards for the young but, from the standpoint of
safeguarding them, there is no more reason to treat the

[Page 198]

patent danger of such an opening as malum
prohibitum than that of many other accessible structures or conditions equally
dangerous. The balance between the responsibilities of owners of property and
guardians of children is too close in accepted considerations of policy to
justify our going beyond what the legislation has fairly indicated; and however
poignant the death of a child in such circumstances may be, it is still one of
the unhappy risks of living in this imperfect world, and not a happening to
call for the infliction of punishment on others.

Having reached this conclusion on the scope of the duty under
section 287  (b) and that the death of the child could not be
charged to neglect of it, I do not find it necessary to consider the view of
the Appeal Court that there could be no question of degrees of care in the
performance of it. This would be to make it absolute against certain
consequences and to rule out mens rea. It will be sufficient, of course,
to deal with a case within the section when it arises but I desire to guard
myself against being taken to assent to that interpretation of the obligation
created.

I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction.

The judgment of Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by

ESTEY J.—The accused company was tried before the Chief
Justice of the Trial Division in Alberta without a jury, at Calgary, on a
charge containing two counts, the first charging an offence contrary to the
provisions of secs. 247 and 284, and the second an offence contrary to sec.
222, of the Criminal Code . At the conclusion of the hearing, the learned
Chief Justice dismissed both charges and delivered the following oral judgment:

There is not any doubt that the condition existing there
with that ten by ten cellar, containing from eight to ten feet of water, and
open at the top, irrespective of the dispute about its approach on the four
sides under the timbers, but open on the top so that the child if he made a
mis-step while walking on these timbers, would fall in the water and probably
drown, or possibly drown, and it is quite clear from the evidence that there
was nothing done to prevent children reaching the top of those timbers or
stringers. That is the situation. It is quite clear that that could have been
remedied by a fence around

[Page 199]

the open cellar or well, or by the
top being planked over. Either of those acts would have made it safe as regards
children. That is the fact that I am bound to find.

I do think that the law is decidedly against the Crown
obtaining a verdict of guilty. No doubt the law is, in my opinion, this child,
however unreasonable you may think it or I may think, it, was a trespasser. He
had no right there. It does not matter whether he could read the sign or not,
according to the best statements of the law in my opinion, and no duty was owed
to that child or to the other children or to anyone else to fence that property
or to plank that cellar, on ground in proper and legal occupation of the
accused. Both charges will be dismissed.

Upon appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta, the dismissal of the charge under sec. 247  was set aside and a verdict
of guilty directed.

Section 247  is a restatement of the common law. Union Colliery
Co. v. The Queen[6]; The
King v. Baker[7]. The
learned trial judge found the child to be a trespasser, and the evidence
supports that finding.

The duty which at common law rested upon a landowner towards
trespassers is stated by Scrutton, L.J., in Hardy v. Central London
Railway Company[8]:

If the children were trespassers, the landowner was not
entitled intentionally to injure them, or to put dangerous traps for them
intending to injure them, but was under no liability if, in trespassing, they
injured themselves on objects legitimately on his land in the course of his
business. Against those he was under no obligation to guard trespassers.

In that case, ""whenever servants of the company saw the
children, they either drove them away or told them to go away,"" and they
apparently went away but repeatedly returned. Upon this evidence the Court of
Appeal refused to find permission express or implied and therefore held the
children to be trespassers rather than licensees, as the learned trial judge
had held them to be.

The authorities are reviewed in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v.
 Anderson[9], where
Chief Justice Duff at p. 218 states:

The respondent is precluded from recovering by reason of the
fact that, being a trespasser, the only duty owing to him is that explained in Barnett's
case[10], not
intentionally to injure him or ""not to do a wilful act in disregard of
humanity towards him,"" ""not to act with reckless disregard of the
presence of the trespasser.""

[Page 200]

It is sometimes suggested that a landowner is under an obligation
to take special precautions with respect to children, but so long as the
children remain trespassers the law seems to be settled that in principle there
is no difference between a child and an adult.

It is recognized that where, as in cases of licensees and invited
guests, a duty is placed upon a party in possession of land, from similar facts
different inferences may be drawn where children rather than adults are
involved, but the principle of legal responsibility is the same regardless of
age. Robert Addie & Sons (Collieries) Ltd. v. Dumbreck[11],
where at p. 376 Viscount Dunedin states as follows:

The truth is that in cases of trespass there can be no
difference in the case of children and adults; because if there is no duty to
take care that cannot vary according to who is the trespasser. It is quite
otherwise in the case of licensees, because there you are brought into contact
with what is known as trap and allurement.

In this case there is no suggestion of any intention to injure
the children or to place a dangerous trap or any trap for them. From time to
time the children did play about this well, but whenever observed were always
warned and chased away by both the employees of the accused company and by
nearby residents. Mr. F. C Tuckett was in charge of the property in question
for the accused company over a period of years. He deposed that in 1941 two of
his grandchildren were drowned in the Elbow River at Calgary, as a result of
which he discussed the possibility of such a fatality at this well, and was
then instructed by the company to fix it so as to keep small children out. He
obtained material and did what he thought was sufficient, and the well remained
substantially as he left it up to the time of the fatality that led to these
proceedings. The taking of such precautions does not create any obligation
towards trespassers but it does exonerate the accused from any suggestion that
it intended to injure or to trap, and indeed any suggestion that it had acted
with a callous or wanton disregard of consequences.

A tragedy such as this, that takes away a very young child,
arouses our feelings of sympathy. However deep and strong these feelings may
be, they must not influ-

[Page 201]

ence one either in ascertaining the law
or in the application thereof to the facts and circumstances of a given case.
If children in this case had been licensees or invitees, the obligation and
responsibility of the accused company would have been very different.

The respondent contended before the Court of Appeal of Alberta
and this Court that the facts disclosed an offence under sec. 287  (b),
and by virtue of the provisions of secs. 951, 1013(5) and 1016(2) a conviction
should now be directed. It is doubtful if the offence under sec. 287  can within
the meaning of these sections be an offence so included under sec. 247 , both
because of the essentials required to constitute the offence and because it is
a summary conviction rather than an indictable offence. Apart from these
considerations the evidence does not disclose that an offence was committed
under sec. 287 . Under that section the accused can be convicted only when the
excavation is left ""unguarded and uninclosed by a guard or fence of sufficient
height and strength to prevent any person from accidentally riding, driving,
walking or falling therein."" The evidence here discloses that the
excavation in question was so far guarded that instead of accidentally falling
therein, the children in question climbed over some obstruction which they
described as a fence. Counsel contended it was not actually a fence, but,
however styled, it did constitute a barrier. Two of the children were called as
witnesses. Bennett Keith deposed as follows:

Q. Was there a fence all around the well?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you and Doug and Spike and Jane climb over the fence?

A. Yes.

* * *

Q. Just tell me this, how did Douglas get on to the plank?
How did he get over the fence you are talking about?

A. He just climbed over.

Q. Did he climb over it by himself?

A. Yes.

The other boy, Gordon Earl Andrews, deposed:

Q. How did you get up on to this plank? How did you get
there?

A. We climbed up.

Q. Climbed up. What did you climb?

A. A plank.

* * *

[Page 202]

Q. Now there is a fence around the well, is there not?

A. It is around the back part of it.

Q. Did you climb over the fence this day?

A. Yes.

Q. And did Doug, and Jane and Benny?

A. Yes.

Upon this evidence the children
encountered the obstacles erected by the company to prevent people from getting
into the well.

The charge was not laid under sec. 287  (b) and at the
trial this section was not brought to the attention of the learned Chief
Justice. His finding of fact must be read in relation to the issues raised
before him. It is obvious that, had he been asked to find the accused guilty
under sec. 287  (b), he would have dealt with the facts in the
light of the provisions of that section, as well as the requirements of secs.
247 and 284.

The evidence is clear that the concrete posts on which the
stringers rest extend about five feet above the ground. Photographs show that
between the posts boards had been placed to prevent persons getting into the
well. The stringers are on top of these posts. On the east side there are one
or two mounds of earth which one might walk up and reach the top of these
posts. The distance from the mounds to the top of the posts is a point upon
which there is some conflict in the evidence but it is clear there is some
distance; and some effort must be made to pass from the mounds of earth to the
top of the stringers. The evidence also discloses a place or two where children
and others by crawling under the boards might reach the well. In either case a
party to get into the well must put forth an effort towards that end. These
facts negative the commission of an offence under sec. 287 , which requires only
such protection as will prevent persons from ""accidentally riding,
driving, walking or falling therein.""

In my opinion, the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be
reversed, the conviction there directed quashed, and the judgment of the trial
judge restored and the charge dismissed as against the accused.

[Page 203]

TASCHEREAU J.—I believe that this appeal should be allowed
and the conviction quashed.

The appellant was acquitted by the trial Judge, but the Court of
Appeal found a breach of the duty imposed by section 287  (b) of the Criminal
Code , and fined the appellant $1,000.

This section is to the effect that whoever is the owner, manager
or superintendent of any abandoned mine or quarry in which there is an
excavation of a sufficient area to endanger human life, must not leave the same
unguarded and uninclosed by a guard or fence of sufficient height and strength
to prevent any person from accidentally riding, driving, walking or falling
therein.

The duty imposed by this section is, therefore, to fence the
excavation in such a manner that a person riding, driving or walking shall not
fall therein accidentally.

We would, I believe, unduly stretch the scope of this section and
go further than the legislator did and, therefore, do violence to the text, if
we held that the fence must be built in such a way that entrance to the
premises is made impossible.

The law contemplates to protect a motorist or a pedestrian from a
danger of which he is unaware, and which may accidentally cause his death. It
does not apply, as in this case, to a trespasser who succeeds in making his way
to the excavation where the danger is obvious, in the manner described by my
brother Rand, and who is accidentally pushed in the water by a companion.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal should be set aside and the
order of acquitment made by the trial Judge should be restored.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Subsection (2) of s. 69 Cr. C.—Prosecution
of a common purpose by several persons—Police officers attempting to effect
arrest of person charged with conspiracy—Firing almost simultaneous by three of
them while in pursuit of the latter—Only one shot causing death—Two officers
charged with manslaughter under subs. (2)—Verdict of guilty affirmed by
majority of appellate court—Whether evidence sufficient to justify such finding—Direction

pronounced by this Court—Granting of new trial may place accused a second time
in jeopardy—Jurisdiction—Grounds of dissent—This Court justified to look into
reasons for judgment of dissenting judges of appellate court.

The appellants, members of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, had, on May 7, 1944, together with another constable by the
name of Massicotte and a corporal Dubé who was in charge, gone to the village
of St. Lambert, situated at some thirty miles from the city of Quebec, for the
purpose of apprehending one Georges Guénette wanted on a charge of having
conspired with others to assist one Plante to escape from the custody of a
peace officer, some ten or more attempts having previously been made. These
constables and three others had made on the same day an earlier trip and, after
having searched the premises of Guénette's father unsuccessfully, decided to
return to their headquarters in the city of Quebec. After proceeding some distance, the four abovenamed constables
turned about and went back to St. Lambert on the chance that Guénette might have returned to his father's
house thinking that the coast was clear, Corporal Dubé stationed the appellant
Lizotte and Massicotte outside the house, while he himself entered it followed
by the appellant Savard. While so engaged, Dube's attention was attracted by a
sound upstairs and he went up just in time to see Guénette jump from a window.
Savard immediately ran from the house in pursuit of Guénette, and, seeing he
was losing ground, and as Guénette ignored his calls to stop, he fired four
shots in the air from his revolver. As Guénette still paid no attention, Savard
lowered his revolver toward a point approximately, so he says, six feet to the
left of Guénette so that the latter would not only hear the bullet but see the
spurt of the ground where it hit. As Savard fired this fifth shot, Guénette was
in the act of jumping a fence, at a distance of more than two hundred feet from
the house, and, as he reached the

[Page 21]

other side, he appeared to bend forward with
the left hand resting on the fence and the right hand on the ground. He then
straightened himself and ran for a distance of approximately seventy-eight feet
where he stumbled and fell face down. According to medical evidence, he was
then dead or died very shortly thereafter. The appellant Lizotte and Massicotte
also ran in pursuit of Guénette, Lizotte firing one shot in the air and a
second one toward a point, he says, some thirty feet to Guénette's right and
Massicotte also firing one shot in Guénette's direction. The indictment charged
that the appellants ""have together and illegally inflicted corporal wounds
which caused the death of (Guénette), thus committing manslaughter."" In
view of the uncertainty as to the identity of the person who had fired the
fatal shot (only one bullet hit Guénette), counsel for the Crown at the opening
of the trial declared expressly that the case fell within the provisions of
subsection 2 of s. 69 Cr. C., and they submitted to the jury that the appellants
had formed a common intention to bring about the arrest of Guénette by any
means, that such intention involved an unlawful purpose, namely, the use of
force beyond the limits permitted by section 43 Cr. C., that each of the
appellants was an accomplice in the commission of a crime by one or the other
and that it was immaterial which of them actually fired the fatal shot, as the
death of Guénette was or ought to have been known to each of them to have been
a probable consequence. Counsel for the Crown further submitted that the common
wrongful intention originated from the acts of the appellants and their
companions and the incidents occurring during their trip, which showed a fixed
purpose to use more violence than necessary to take Guénette into custody, or
that the common intent started to be illegal at the moment of the simultaneous
firing by the appellants and Massicotte. The trial judge after having read
subsection 2 of section 69 Cr. C., charged the jury in so many words that it
applied; he also stated that there was no illegality attaching to the
appellants' conduct prior to the moment of the firing, but that the illegality
then started, if the jury was of the opinion that they had then used undue
violence (s. 43 Cr. C). The appellants were found guilty and condemned
respectively to twelve and nine months' imprisonment. The conviction was
affirmed by a majority of the appellate court, the two dissenting judges being
of the opinion that a new trial should be granted.

Held that the
appeal should be allowed, the convictions quashed and the appellants be
discharged. There is no evidence upon which a finding could be made that the
appellants formed at any time a common wrongful intention as required by
subsection 2 of section 69 Cr. C.—Moreover the erroneous directions given by
the trial judge have necessarily influenced the jury's minds and have totally
rendered defective and void the conclusion they have reached.—Their verdict,
being thus illegal, must be quashed.

Counsel for the Crown also contended that, if
the verdict was held to be illegal, the only remedy this Court could grant
would be an order for a new trial, as the Court could not go beyond what was
directed by the dissenting judgments: the appellants could then be proceeded
against individually under subsection (1) of section 69 Cr. C. or additional
evidence might be forthcoming which would make subsection (2) applicable.

[Page 22]

Held that, in
a case like the present, such an order ought not to be made, so as to permit an
entirely new case to be made against the appellants. While the existence of a
dissent on a question of law (s. 1023 Cr. C.) is a condition precedent for an
appeal to this Court, the Court once seized of the appeal is not limited to the
remedy considered appropriate in the dissent, but has complete jurisdiction to
direct the remedy which in its opinion the Court appealed from ought to have
granted (s. 1024 Cr. C). Under the circumstances of the case and in view of the
manner the case was deliberately proceeded with by the Crown, the granting of a
new trial would violate the fundamental right of an accused not to be placed
for a second time in jeopardy. Manchuk v. the King ([1938] S.C.R.
341 and Wexler v. The King [1939] S.C.R. 350) foll.

Per The Chief
Justice and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. The Supreme Court of Canada, when given
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal on any question of law on which there has
been dissent in the court of appeal (section 1023 Cr. C.), is justified,
whether grounds of dissent are specified or not in the formal judgment of that
court, to look into the reasons for judgment of the dissenting judges in order
to find the grounds of dissent.—Reinblatt v. The King ((1933)
S.C.R. 694) foll.

APPEAL by the appellants from a judgment by a
majority of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province
 of Quebec, affirming a verdict
of guilty rendered by a jury in a trial of manslaughter, the dissenting
judgments ordering a new trial.

The material facts of the case and the
questions at issue are stated in the above headnote and in the judgments now
reported.

Lucien H. Gendron K.C., Gérald Fauteux
K.C. and Mark Drouin K.C. for the appellants.

Antoine Rivard K.C. and Noël Dorion K.C. for
the respondent.

The judgment of The Chief Justice and of Kerwin
and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau J.:—Les appelants Fernand
Savard et Roger Lizotte, tous deux de la Gendarmerie Royale canadienne, ont été traduits devant la Cour d'Assises à Québec,
pour répondre à l'accusation d'avoir:—

ensemble illégalement causé des lésions corporelles
qui ont entraîné la mort de Georges Guénette commettant par là un crime
d'homicide involontaire (manslaughter).

[Page 23]

Trouvés coupables, ils furent condamnés
respectivement à douze et à neuf mois de prison, et ce verdict du jury fut
confirmé par la Cour du Banc du Roi. MM. les juges Francœur et E. Stuart McDougall, qui étaient dissidents,
auraient accordé un nouveau procès.

Dans le jugement formel de la Cour du Banc du Roi,
la dissidence de M. le juge Francœur est exprimée dans les termes suivants:—

(a) Admission au cours du procès de
preuve illégale;

(b) Direction
erronée en droit sur l'interprétation de l'article 69  du Code Criminel .

Et celle de M. le juge McDougall se lit ainsi:—

that,

(a) the accused were deprived of
their right to challenge peremptorily the number of jurors allowed by law;

(b) that the presiding judge
committed an error in law in instructing the jury that subsection 2  of section
69  of the Criminal Code  applied;

(c) that the presiding judge further
erred in law in instructing the jury that evidence declared by him to be
irrelevant as to the guilt of the accused would be helpful and could be
accepted by the jury to indicate an atmosphere or ""climat spécial"" surrounding
the actions of the accused.

Ces deux mêmes juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi,
dans leurs raisons où cette Cour peut également chercher des motifs de
dissidence, en sont également venus à la conclusion qu'il n'y a aucune preuve
qui puisse justifier l'application de l'article 69 , paragraphe 2, Code
Criminel.

Georges Guénette, Roland Fontaine et Edouard
Bernard étaient tous trois accusés d'avoir conspiré ensemble afin de faire
évader un nommé Hervé Plante, détenu par Gordon P. Coutu, qui avait
antérieurement procédé à son arrestation. Le mandat avait été émis par M. le juge
Laetare Roy, de la Cour des Sessions de la Paix à Québec, le 3 mars 1943, mais le 6 mai 1944, il n'avait pas encore été exécuté. Durant
au delà de 14 mois, les prévenus
avaient réussi à dépister les policiers, qui avaient fait plus de dix voyages à
St-Lambert, dans le comté de Lévis, mais chaque fois, leurs recherches étaient
demeurées infructueuses.

Dans l'après-midi du 6 mai 1944, le caporal
Turgeon, en charge du détachement de la Gendarmerie Royale à Québec, décida de
faire une nouvelle tentative afin d'opérer ces arrestations. Il donna
instruction au constable Dubé, accompagné
de six constables, dont les appelants, de se

[Page 24]

rendre à St-Lambert, et c'est au cours de leurs
recherches que Georges Guénette fut tué d'une balle de revolver. Et comme
conséquence de cette tragédie, Savard et Lizotte furent accusés d'homicide
involontaire coupable.

Durant cette nuit du 6 au 7 mai, les constables firent deux autres voyages à
St-Lambert. Quelques incidents, qui se produisirent au cours du premier,
doivent nécessairement être mentionnés, car il en sera question plus loin,
lorsque nous examinerons certains aspects légaux de la cause, que les parties
ont discutés au cours de l'audition.

En arrivant à St-Lambert, Dubé aperçut une
automobile qui filait vers l'autre extrémité du village, dans la direction de
St-Isidore. Croyant que cette voiture pouvait être occupée par les trois
personnes recherchées, il la suivit, mais après s'être rendu compte que les
passagers n'étaient pas ceux qu'il désirait appréhender, il leur permit de
continuer leur route. Mais la preuve révèle qu'avant de leur donner cette
autorisation, l'un des constables non
identifié dans l'automobile de Dubé aurait dit aux passagers, parmi lesquels se
trouvait un nommé Baillargeon:—""Si
vous n'aviez pas arrêté, nous aurions tiré.""

Lorsque Dubé revint avec ses deux compagnons au
village de St-Lambert, il donna instruction à trois constables,
Lizotte, Desjardins et Emond de se rendre chez Fontaine et Edouard Bernard, tous deux
également recherchés, pendant que lui-même avec d'autres iraient chez Guénette.
Chez Fontaine, l'un des constables serait entré dans la chambre de mademoiselle Jeannette Fontaine, et lui
aurait dit:—""Je regrette de
vous déranger"". Elle aurait répondu, d'après son témoignage:—""Vous vous
fatiguez encore pour rien ce matin"". Et ce même constable
aurait répondu à son tour:—""Vous croyez que nous nous fatiguons pour rien, peut-être que
d'autres seront fatigués avant longtemps"".

Durant ce temps, les autres constables qui n'étaient pas allés chez
Fontaine firent des recherches dans la maison de Guénette et dans les environs.
Dubé rapporte qu'après qu'il eût fouillé en vain la maison, le père Guénette
lui dit qu'il n'avait pas vu son fils depuis quinze jours, qu'il venait
rarement à la maison, qu'il avait perdu toute influence sur lui et qu'il était
bien décidé à ne pas être pris vivant.

[Page 25]

Dubé décida alors de retourner à Québec, mais à la
sortie de la maison de Guénette, il rencontra le constable
Massicotte qui, au second étage de la grange de Guénette,
avait trouvé une couverture et un oreiller. Il s'était rendu compte que ce lit
improvisé avait été récemment occupé, car l'oreiller était encore chaud. On fit
alors d'autres recherches dans la direction de la rivière Chaudière, mais sans
résultat.

Au cours du voyage de retour vers Québec, Dubé
s'avisa de revenir à la maison de Guénette accompagné de trois constables, Massicotte, Savard et Lizotte,
tandis que les autres devaient continuer leur route vers la ville. En arrivant
à St-Lambert, il plaça ses hommes à des points stratégiques autour de la maison
de Guénette, y pénétra lui-même et demanda au père Guénette si son fils était
revenu. C'est à ce moment qu'il entendit un bruit provenant de l'étage
supérieur, où il monta, et vit Georges Guénette, l'homme qu'il recherchait,
sautant par une fenêtre du côté ouest de la maison. Massicotte, Savard et
Lizotte partirent alors à sa poursuite vers la rivière, où les constables, lors de leur visite précédente,
avaient remarqué des embarcations.

Guénette, qui avait une avance d'environ cinquante
pieds et qui gagnait toujours du terrain, refusa de s'arrêter, malgré les
ordres qu'on lui intimait, continua sa course à travers le champ fraîchement
labouré et sauta la clôture en y posant la main gauche, de sorte qu'il avait
les pieds dans une position horizontale à la droite de son corps. Savard était
au centre derrière lui; il avait Lizotte à sa droite, placé dans le chemin
Brochu, et Massicotte à sa gauche. C'est pendant cette course que les trois constables firent feu. Savard tira cinq coups
de son revolver 45, Massicotte un
seul d'un revolver de même calibre et Lizotte deux coups, d'un revolver 38. Tous d'après leurs témoignages tirèrent en
l'air, sauf Savard et Lizotte qui tirèrent chacun un coup, vers le sol, mais à
côté de Guénette, afin de l'impressionner
davantage et le convaincre qu'il était préférable de se rendre.

Après avoir sauté cette clôture, située à 225 pieds de sa résidence, Guénette parcourut
encore 78 pieds et là, après avoir fait une hésitation, il tomba la
face contre terre. La

[Page 26]

preuve médicale révèle qu'il dût mourir à ce moment
ou quelques instants plus tard. La balle, qui avait pénétré au dessus du rein
gauche, était sortie dans la région du poumon droit. Le docteur Gilbert, de
Charny, le premier qui constata la mort, exprima l'opinion que la balle devait
provenir d'un revolver calibre 38, car cette dernière pouvait être introduite plus facilement dans
l'orifice de la blessure. Cependant, cette prétention n'est pas admise par l'un
des médecins de la Couronne.

Ce résumé de la preuve, peut-être trop long, est
cependant nécessaire pour bien situer le litige et pour déterminer les
questions légales qui nous sont actuellement soumises et que l'on trouve dans
le jugement formel de la Cour du Banc du Roi et les raisons écrites des juges
dissidents.

La Couronne a fait reposer sa cause devant le jury
sur le paragraphe 2  de l'article 69  du Code Criminel . C'est aussi la directive
donnée par le juge présidant le procès. Cet article se lit ainsi:—

69. (2) Quand
plusieurs personnes forment ensemble le projet de faire quelque chose
d'illégal, et de s'entraider dans ce projet, chacune d'elles est complice de
toute infraction commise par l'une d'entre elles dans la poursuite de leur but
commun, si elles savaient ou devaient savoir que la commission de cette
infraction devait être la conséquence probable de la poursuite de leur but
commun.

Une seule balle a frappé Guénette, et, comme il
était assez problématique de dire qui avait tiré cette balle, on a voulu, par
le jeu de l'article 69 , paragraphe
2 , faire disparaître cette
difficulté de l'esprit du jury, en leur disant que les accusés faisaient partie
d'un complot illégal, que chacun d'eux était complice d'une infraction commise
par l'un ou l'autre des constables et qu'il était en conséquence immatériel de déterminer qui avait tiré
le coup fatal.

Au cours du procès qui eut lieu à Québec, le
procureur de la Couronne, expliquant la cause au jury, fit un résumé de la
preuve qu'il désirait lui soumettre, et lui dit:—

Vous aurez à juger, messieurs les jurés, si
les deux agents n'étaient pas alors engagés dans la poursuite de buts
illégaux: l'arrestation de Guénette sans mandat entre leurs mains et le
recours à des moyens aussi radicaux pour l'exécution de leur mission. Dans
l'affirmative, la Couronne vous soumettra qu'en droit les deux accusés
doivent répondre de la mort de Guénette.

[Page 27]

Plus tard, lorsque la preuve de la Couronne fut
terminée, la défense présenta une motion de non-lieu de la part de l'accusé
Lizotte, et dans la réplique de l'avocat de la Couronne, on y trouve ce qui
suit:—

Les jurés décideront si, à un moment donné,
cette expédition, qui a pu paraître commencée avec des buts légaux, est devenue
une expédition illégale.

A la conclusion du procès, lors de sa plaidoirie au
jury, l'un des avocats de la Couronne s'exprima ainsi:—

C'est que cette loi a été faite précisément
pour prévoir de ces cas comme celui qui nous occupe actuellement, lorsqu'une,
deux, trois ou quatre personnes, ensemble, dans un même but, commettent des
actes illégaux; ils sont tous ensemble responsables des conséquences, et
c'est pour cela qu'il importe peu de savoir si c'est la balle de Lizotte ou
de Savard qui a tué.

Ce qu'il importe de savoir, c'est si ces
deux-là, ou ces trois-là ou quatre-l'à, ensemble, ne s'étaient pas réunis pour
faire de la poursuite de Guénette une opération qui est devenue illégale du
moment où ils ont commencé à tirer. Guénette ne serait pas mort aujourd'hui.

Ce n'est pas ensemble qu'ils ont tiré. C'est
parce qu'ensemble ils ont pris des moyens illégaux pour arriver à leur fin avec
illégalité, que l'article 69 , paragraphe 2 , trouve son application.

Et plus tard, un second avocat de la Couronne dit à
son tour:—

L'invention de Lizotte pour essayer de
chercher ailleurs le coupable est une invention qui ne tient pas debout;
d'autant plus que, même si c'était vrai, ces deux personnes étaient engagées
dans la poursuite de moyens communs qui étaient des moyens illégaux, et au même
titre que celui qui aurait vraisemblablement tiré, ils sont coupables de manslaughter, ils sont coupables de la mort
qu'on leur impute de Guénette.

Et, dans son adresse au jury, le juge donne la
direction légale suivante:—

L'article 69 ,
paragraphe 2 , s'applique. Je l'affirme et j'y reviendrai
plus tard.

Ailleurs, il dit:—

Devez-vous trouver une différence de
responsabilité entre l'accusé Savard et entre l'accusé Lizotte, si vous en
venez à un verdict de culpabilité?

Et après avoir cité l'article 69 , paragraphe 2 , du Code Criminel , l'honorable juge continue:—

Me Gendron soutient que cet article ne
s'applique pas. Malheureusement, je ne puis partager son opinion. Le
paragraphe 2 s'applique.
L'illégalité commença au moment où ils, les accusés,
et le constable Massicotte, se
mirent ensemble à tirer dans la poursuite de leur but commun, contrairement à
la loi, si vous jugez qu'ils abusèrent de la violence.

L'entente est devenue illégale au cours de
l'exécution, tousjours si les accusés excédèrent,
d'après vous les moyens raisonnables et causèrent la mort—article 43 C. Cr.

[Page 28]

D'après ces textes que je viens de citer, les constables poursuivaient donc des buts
illégaux, leur expédition qui à l'origine a pu paraître légale serait devenue
une expédition illégale, au moment où les deux appelants et Massicotte ont
commencé à tirer. Comme conséquence, en vertu des dispositions de l'article
69 , paragraphe 2 , tous ceux qui ont fait feu sont coupables au
même degré, quel que soit celui qui ait tué Guénette. C'est bien là la théorie
de la Couronne, admise par le juge au cours du procès.

Pour que l'article 69 , paragraphe 2 , s'applique,
il faut de toute nécessité qu'il y ait entente de poursuivre un but illégal.
C'est l'élément essentiel qui entraînera la culpabilité de tous, si l'un d'eux
commet une infraction dans la poursuite de ce but.

Or, il importe donc de se demander quel projet
illégal avaient conçu les accusés, quel acte défendu par la loi ils avaient
projeté de poser; où, quand et
comment ils se sont concertés pour qu'ils tombent sous le coup de l'article que
je viens de citer.

Lors de l'audition de la cause devant cette Cour,
le procureur de la Couronne a tenté d'établir que le projet de commettre un
acte illégal n'était pas nécessairement né sur le terrain de Guénette au moment
où les constables ont commencé à
faire feu, mais que les actes des appelants et de leurs compagnons, au cours du
trajet de Québec à St-Lambert, démontraient l'intention bien arrêtée d'user de
plus de violence qu'il n'était nécessaire pour procéder à l'arrestation de
Guénette. Il y aurait donc eu complot de commettre un acte illégal, et
l'illégalité de cet acte consisterait dans la violation de l'article 43  du Code Criminel , qui se lit ainsi:—

43. Tout individu, qui
opère légalement l'arrestation d'un autre pour quelque cause autre qu'une
infraction mentionnée en l'article qui précède, est justifiable, si celui qu'il
cherche à arrêter tente de se soustraire par la fuite à cette arrestation,
d'employer la force nécessaire pour empêcher son évasion, sauf si cette évasion
peut être empêchée par des moyens raisonnables sans recourir à la violence;
mais cette force ne doit être destinée ni de nature à causer la mort ou des
lésions corporelles graves.

Cette prétention doit être rejetée pour deux
raisons. La première, c'est qu'elle n'a jamais été soumise au jury, qui n'a pas
eu à se prononcer sur ce point, et qui en a été empêché par les directives
mêmes du juge, qui lui a dit que l'illégalité avait commencé au moment même où
les

[Page 29]

coups de feu ont été tirés.
La seconde raison qui motive le rejet de cette prétention, c'est qu'il n'y a
aucune preuve au dossier qui puisse justifier un jury, instruit de ses devoirs,
d'en arriver légalement à une semblable conclusion. Pour essayer d'établir
l'intention commune des constables de faire usage d'une force plus que
nécessaire, on a invoqué l'incident qui est arrivé lorsqu'un constable aurait dit aux passagers de
l'automobile Baillargeon: ""Si
vous n'aviez pas arrêté, nous aurions tiré"". Et on a relevé aussi la
conversation entre le constable non
identifié qui aurait dit à mademoiselle Fontaine:

Vous croyez que nous nous fatiguons pour rien,
peut-être que d'autres seront fatigués avant longtemps.

Ces faits ne sont pas pertinents à la cause, et
leur récit devant le jury était inadmissible. Ces paroles ont été prononcées
hors la présence des accusés et ne peuvent en aucune façon servir de preuve
contre eux.

Je n'ignore pas que lorsqu'il s'agit de
conspiration, des déclarations faites par l'un des conspirateurs, hors la
présence des autres, peuvent en certains cas, servir de preuve contre tous les
conspirateurs; mais encore faut-il qu'il existe quelque connexité entre ces
déclarations et la poursuite du but commun qui, dans le cas actuel, aurait
conduit à la mort de Guénette. De plus, cette règle que je viens de citer, et
qui dans notre droit constitue une exception, est basée sur la théorie qui veut
que dans le cas de conspiration, vu qu'il y a unité de volonté, la déclaration
de l'un est censée être la déclaration de tous. Pour que la léclaration de l'un
puisse ainsi servir contre les autres, il faut donc prouver par des preuves
additionnelles que celui contre qui on veut s'en servir était partie au
complot. Cette autre preuve dans le cas présent fait totalement défaut.

Ces deux faits sont les seuls que la Couronne a
invoqués pour démontrer l'existence d'un complot antérieur. Il me semble
qu'elle a faillir/?/ dans sa tentative de convaincre la Cour de l'existence de
cette entente préalable de commettre un acte illégal.

D'ailleurs, dans sa charge au jury, le juge a dit
que le témoignage de Baillargeon ne pouvait pas incriminer les deux accusés, et
il a aussi ajouté que le témoignage de mademoiselle Fontaine ne pouvait pas non
plus avoir

[Page 30]

d'influence sur la cause. Il a cependant autorisé
le jury à prendre connaissance de la déclaration faite à Baillargeon, non pas
parce qu'elle peut relier les accusés à la tragédie qui est arrivée, mais
seulement afin de ""se mettre dans une atmosphère ou un climat
spécial"". Si je m'accorde avec le juge quand il dit que la preuve de ces
deux incidents ne peut incriminer les deux accusés, je diffère entièrement
d'opinion avec lui quant à sa seconde remarque. La preuve est pertinente ou
non. Comme elle ne l'est pas, elle n'aurait pas dû être soumise au jury, et
encore moins pour le justifier au cours d'un procès criminel de se placer dans
un ""climat special"", ce
qui à mon sens constitue une nouvelle et bien étonnante théorie.

La Couronne elle-même ne semble pas convaincue de
l'existence de ce plan préconçu par les constables pour faire usage d'une violence déraisonnable, car elle dit dans son factum:—

The expedition was without any doubt legal
in its purpose, etc.

Et le juge dit au jury:—

L'entente est devenue illégale au cours de
l'exécution.

Evidemment, le but de cette expédition était légal.
On se rendait à St-Lambert pour exécuter le mandat émis contre Guénette et les
autres par M. le juge Lætare Roy. Rien
dans la preuve ne peut laisser supposer que les constables
aient eu des intentions criminelles, qu'ils aient voulu
faire autre chose que de mettre à exécution, par des moyens légaux, l'ordre
légal du magistrat.

Il reste, comme le juge l'a dit au jury, et comme
d'ailleurs la Couronne elle-même l'a prétendu au cours du procès, que l'entente
serait devenue illégale au cours de l'expédition. Le complot illégal existerait
donc, et son fait constitutif serait que les accusés et leurs compagnons
auraient fait feu presque simultanément, pour forcer Guénette à arrêter sa
course.

Mais la simultanéité de ces coups de feu est-elle
bien la preuve d'une résolution concertée et arrêtée, agréée par tous, de poser
un acte illégal?

Je sais bien, et la jurisprudence et les auteurs
l'enseignent, que le complot n'a pas besoin toujours de longue préparation, et
même qu'en certains cas, il peut être établi par la preuve de certains faits,
qui démontrent chez plusieurs

[Page 31]

l'existence d'une volonté commune d'agir
illégalement. Mais la seule résolution concertée, qu'elle soit préalable ou
sur-le-champ, n'est pas suffisante; pour qu'il y ait crime, il faut le dessein,
l'intention de commettre un acte illégal, qui est une circonstance nécessaire à
la criminalité. Sans doute, les
trois constables qui poursuivaient
Guénette se sont entendus, tacitement on autrement, pour tirer des coups de feu
dans l'air ou sur le sol, afin d'inspirer au fugitif une crainte salutaire, qui
peut-être le pousserait à se livrer aux officiers de justice, et cette entente
demeure jusqu'ici dans les cadres de la stricte légalité. Rien en effet ne défend
à des constables, autorisés à
porter des armes, de s'en servir pour les fins que je viens de mentionner.

Dans le cas présent, six coups ont été tirés en
l'air, et deux dans la direction du sol. Qu'au cours de la poursuite d'un but
légal, qui était l'arrestation de Guénette, une balle égarée ou non, provenant
de l'arme de l'un des poursuivants, frappe la victime, n'indique pas qu'il y
ait unité de but entre tous les policiers pour commettre un acte illégal, et
qu'il s'ensuive que, par l'opération de l'article 69 , paragraphe 2 , tous soient
tenus responsables de l'imprudence criminelle de l'un, si imprudence criminelle
il y a véritablement. Cet acte isolé ne peut certes pas démontrer un concert de
volontés confondues en une volonté unique et commune, de commettre un acte
illégal et qui marquerait les actes de tous du sceau de la criminalité. Tout au
plus indique-t-il l'agissement d'une seule personne qui, sans doute, peut être
le résultat d'une négligence ou d'une imprudence criminelle, si on y rencontre les
éléments voulus, ou encore le simple résultat d'un accident qui n'entraînerait
aucune responsabilité.

On sait que le complot criminel est un crime par
lui-même, qu'il est complet, et par conséquent punissable, sans qu'il soit
nécessaire de prouver un commencement d'exécution. Le législateur a considéré
la résolution arrêtée de plusieurs personnes de commettre un crime, sans même
que le crime ne soit commis, comme une menace envers la société, qui justifie
cette dernière représentée par l'Etat de se placer en légitime défense et
d'exercer une action répressive. Si Guénette n'eut pas été frappé, il est
certain

[Page 32]

que personne n'eût songé alors à voir dans les
actes des constables qui tiraient
en l'air, pour procéder à cette arrestation, les éléments du complot. Et
cependant, d'après la théorie de la Couronne, ces constables
eussent été des criminels qui, sans réaliser la fin
poursuivie, étaient tout de même tous des conspirateurs qui avaient dans
l'esprit des intentions perverses.

Or, c'est parce qu'on a dit au jury qu'il y avait
complot et que l'article 69 (2)  s'appliquait;
c'est parce qu'on lui a enseigné que l'acte isolé de l'un entraînait la
responsabilité de l'autre; et c'est parce qu'instruit qu'il n'avait pas à se
demander qui avait tiré la balle qui a causé la mort de Guénette, que le jury a
rendu un verdict que la loi du pays n'autorise pas. C'est cette directive
erronée, qui a nécessairement influencé le jury et qui viole totalement la
conclusion à laquelle il est arrivé. Je suis clairement d'opinion, comme
d'ailleurs MM. les juges Francœur et McDougall le disent dans leurs notes
dissidentes, qu'il n'y a aucune preuve qui puisse justifier l'existence d'un
semblable complot criminel, et par conséquent, l'application de l'article 69 (2) . Entaché d'illégalité, ce verdict doit
être cassé.

Mais la Couronne soutient que, même si le verdict
est illégal, cette Cour ne peut pas accorder plus que les juges dissidents de
la Cour du Banc du Roi n'ont accordé, soit un nouveau procès. Je ne puis
admettre cette prétention, que je crois erronée en droit. La juridiction de
cette Cour est limitée évidemment aux questions de droit sur lesquelles il y a
eu dissidence en Cour du Banc du Roi. L'une de ces dissidences était qu'on
avait donné à l'article 69 (2)  du
Code Criminel  une interprétation erronée, et avec cette dissidence, je suis
d'accord.

Mais il est du devoir de cette Cour, lorsqu'elle
croit une dissidence bien fondée, de procéder à rendre le jugement qui aurait
dû être prononcé, et, pour atteindre ce but, elle tient ses pouvoirs de
l'article 1024  du Code Criminel ,
qui dit:—

1024, La Cour Suprême
du Canada établit à cet égard la règle ou rend l'ordonnance qui lui semble
juste, soit aux fins de confirmer le jugement de culpabilité ou d'accorder un
nouveau procès, soit autrement, soit aux fins d'accueillir ou de refuser cette
demande, et établit toutes autres règles et décerne toutes autres ordonnances
nécessaires pour mettre cette règle ou ordonnance à effet.

[Page 33]

La question de droit qui donne juridiction à cette
Cour, qui en réalité la saisit du litige, est formulée par la Cour du Banc du
Roi, mais le remède qui doit être apporté, quand elle est jugée fondée, est du
ressort de cette Cour, qui peut et doit alors rendre l'ordonnance que requiert
la justice. (Manchuk v. The King[1]).

Mais si cette Cour a ce pouvoir d'accorder un
remède différent de celui que les juges dissidents de la Cour du Banc du Roi
ont cru juste d'appliquer, doit-elle exercer ce droit, ou ordonner qu'il y ait
un nouveau procès? Je pense bien qu'il y aurait lieu à un nouveau procès, si la
Couronne, ayant soumis la cause qu'elle a présentée au jury, avait demandé
subsidiairement de déterminer la culpabilité de l'un des accusés, au cas où
l'article 69 (2)  ne s'appliquerait
pas, et si le juge, refusant de donner cette dernière instruction, avait avisé
le jury que seul 69 (2) trouvait
son application. Alors, évidemment, dans le cas d'un acquittement, la Couronne,
n'ayant pas obtenu la justice qu'elle demandait, aurait pu invoquer ce grief et
obtenir un nouveau procès.

Mais, dans le cas qui nous occupe, c'est l'inverse
qui se présente. La Couronne a soumis que l'article 69
(2)  s'appliquait. C'est le fondement même de sa
prétention; toute sa cause repose sur
cette théorie, et c'est ainsi qu'elle a voulu que les accusés fussent jugés.
Alors qu'elle est intimée devant cette Cour et qu'il est établi que sa première
tentative d'obtenir une condamnation doit nécessairement faillir, elle demande
la permission de recommencer le procès, en soumettant les mêmes faits ou des
faits additionnels. Ceci ne peut pas être accordé.

Les appelants ont été en péril déjà, au cours de ce
premier procès. Ils ont été jugés devant une cour compétente par douze de leurs
pairs; ils ont répondu à une accusation légalement portée, à laquelle ils ont
plaidé, et le procès s'est instruit suivant les soumissions légales de la
Couronne que le tribunal a acceptées.

Il est un principe de droit criminel, qui date de
temps immémoriaux, qu'un accusé ne peut pas être ""in
jeopardy"" deux fois. Cette doctrine est aujourd'hui
universellement reconnue et sanctionnée par les tribunaux. Même si
personnellement j'entretenais des doutes sur cette question, je serais lié par
une décision de cette Cour, rendue il y a

[Page 34]

quelques années. En effet, dans la cause de Wexler
v. The King[2] où la Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Québec avait ordonné un
nouveau procès, cette Cour a prononcé l'acquittement, et le principe posé dans
cette cause-là doit nous guider dans la détermination de celle-ci. Comme le
disait alors Sir Lyman Duff, juge
en chef:—

To set aside a verdict of acquittal in such
circumstances, merely because the case for the Crown might, on a possible view
of the evidence, have been put upon another footing would, it appears to me,
introduce a most dangerous practice; a practice not, I think, sanctioned by the
statute.

Et M. le juge Kerwin s'exprimait ainsi:—

The real point for determination is
whether, after an accused person has been tried on a charge of murder and
acquitted, the Crown is entitled to an order for a new trial in order to
present an entirely new case against him.

An appeal is given the Crown by the 1930
amendment to section 1013 of the Code ""on any ground of appeal which
involves a question of law alone."" Assuming, without deciding, that the
pertinent question here is one of law, the Crown's contention is not entitled
to prevail.

Je crois donc, pour les raisons ci-dessus, que
l'appel doit être maintenu et que les accusés doivent être libérés. Etant donné
cette conclusion à laquelle j'arrive, il est inutile de discuter les autres
moyens d'appel qui ont été soulevés.

Rand J.—The case against the accused, advisedly and exclusively presented
by the Crown to the jury, was this: the use of arms by way of shooting in the
air or the ground was in the circumstances an unnecessary use of force and
hence illegal; from its commencement, it constituted an unlawful common purpose
affecting all those taking part in it; and each officer became, under ss. 2  of
sec. 69  of the Criminal Code , responsible for the consequences of that use of
arms by the others. This dispensed with the consideration by the jury of the
question whose shot brought the deceased down.

The following excerpts from the address of Crown
counsel summarize the position taken:

Admettons, pour le bénéfice de la discussion
et sans rien retirer de ce que j'ai dit jusqu'à présent, que, jusqu'à la fuite
de Guénette, tout est parfait, tout est légal. Guénette saute, ils partent à
courir après, c'est ce qu'ils doivent faire; ils sont mal organisés; parce
qu'ils sont mal organisés, ils vont être obligés de sauter des barrières, ça ne
fait rien, c'est leur faute, ils sont mal organisés; à un moment donné, ils se
mettent à tirer.

[Page 35]

De ce moment, Votre Seigneurie, tous ensemble
et d'un commun accord, Lizotte et Savard ont ensemble décidé, dans la poursuite
du but commun, d'employer des moyens illégaux. De ce moment-là il y a entre eux
une entente qui est devenue une entente illégale.

* * *

C'est que cette loi a été faite précisément pour
prévoir de ces cas comme celui qui nous occupe actuellement, lorsqu'une, deux,
trois ou quatre personnes, ensemble, commettent ensemble, dans un même but, des
actes illégaux; ils sont tous ensemble responsables des conséquences, et c'est
pour ça qu'il importe peu de savoir si c'est la balle de Lizotte ou de Savard
qui a tué.

The trial judge adopting the same view
instructed the jury that ss. 2 applied and that the only question was accident
or not, in the following language:

L'article 69 , paragraphe 2 , s'applique.
Je l'affirme et j'y reviendrai plus tard.

* * *

Comme il ne s'agissait que d'une question de
droit qui n'intéressait pas le jury, parce que je déciderais le contraire de la
prétention de Me Gendron, que je voulais simplement discuter ses arguments, une
traduction eut été inutile et n'eut servi qu'à créer de la confusion.

Je n'ai pas traduit plus loin pour le jury que
les citations qui appuyaient mon opinion. Il est clair que la Couronne doit
faire sa preuve. C'est une question de faits pour le jury de dire si elle l'a
fait ou non. S'il s'agissait d'un accident ou non.

* * *

Devez-vous trouver une différence de
responsabilité entre l'accusé Savard et l'accusé Lizotte, si vous en venez au
verdict de culpabilité?

* * *

Me Gendron soutient que cet article ne
s'applique pas. Malheureusement, je ne puis partager son opinion. Le paragraphe
2 s'applique. L'illégalité
commence au moment où ils, les accusés et le constable Massicotte, se mirent ensemble à tirer dans la poursuite de leur but
commun, contrairement à la loi, si vous jugez qu'ils abusèrent de la violence.

It is desirable for the moment to consider the
circumstances in relation to sec. 69 , which is enacted in these words:

69. Accessories, principals, etc.—Every one
is a party to and guilty of an offence who

(a) actually commits it;

(b) does or omits an act for the
purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence;

(c) abets any person in commission
of the offence; or

(d) counsels or procures any person
to commit the offence.

[Page 36]

2. Common intention by several persons.—If
several persons form a common intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose, and
to assist each other «therein, each of them is a party to every offence
committed by any one of them in the prosecution of such common purpose, the
commission of which offence was, or ought to have been known to be a probable
consequence of the prosecution of such common purpose.

Two conditions are seen to be essential to bring
the common purpose charged within ss. 2: that it was unlawful and that the
shooting of the deceased ought to have been known to be a probable consequence
of it. It was of course open to the Crown, under the first subsection, to seek
at the same time to hold individually responsible the officer whose shot
actually struck the deceased; but that course, as I have intimated, was
deliberately put aside. One reason for this was virtually conceded: the
conviction of both accused was sought, but as only one bullet struck the
deceased, resort to ss. 2 was necessary. There was also serious doubt of which
one of the eight shots fired from three guns, all of the others admittedly into
the air or the ground, was fatal; but consistently with the case submitted the
trial judge, over the objections of the accused, gave the instruction quoted. It
was not suggested that the accused intended to hit the victim, and accident
might have arisen from a ricochet or from the officer stumbling on uneven
ground at the moment of firing.

I am unable to agree that in the circumstances
the use made of arms for such a purpose could be found or held to be unlawful.
Failing illegality, it becomes unnecessary to consider whether the accused
could be found liable for the death as a probable consequence. The direction
that ss. 2 applied was therefore an error that vitiates the conviction and it
must be set aside.

On the argument, the actual theory laid before
the jury was confused with a purpose, formed when the detachment set out from
Quebec, to bring back the deceased if necessary by the use of any force short
of taking life, even though in excess of that permitted by section 43 , and that
this involved the accused in the shot that caused the death. The short answer
to this is that there was not a tittle of evidence by which it could have been
supported. Even less was there any evidence to justify the view that such a
purpose arose at the moment of the firing.

[Page 37]

The question now is whether the Crown should be
permitted to submit to another jury the alternative view, the individual
responsibility of each of the accused, which in the first instance it
deliberately refrained from presenting. In that situation we are governed by a
judgment of this Court, (Wexler v. The King[3]) in which it was laid down that such a
proceeding would violate the fundamental right of an accused not to be placed
for a second time in jeopardy.

It was urged that it would be contrary to the
public interest that such a serious consequence through force, excessive in
fact, in making an arrest, should escape punishment. I do not consider whether
or not there was evidence on which the jury could have found whose act struck
the deceased down. The guilt or innocence of either accused is not relevant to
the question with which I am now dealing. What the Wexler case (1)
declares is the principle that in such circumstances the interest of the
accused becomes the paramount public interest; that, however serious the
occurrence may have been, and disregarding all question of guilt or innocence,
the Crown having failed on an hypothesis which was fairly and unexceptionably
to itself tried out, is not on the same set of facts and on a view open to it
but rejected on the first trial to be permitted a second opportunity to try to
fasten guilt upon an accused. The Wexler case (1) was an appeal from an
acquittal, but there is no difference in principle between that and a
conviction on a basis for which there was no support in law or in fact. And
once it is clear that the conviction cannot stand, justice requires the same
treatment in the one case as in the other.

I would therefore allow the appeal and quash the
convictions.

Kellock J.—This is an appeal from the judgment or order of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, of the province of Quebec, pronounced the 28th day of June, 1945, Francœur and Stuart
McDougall JJ. dissenting, which affirmed the conviction of the appellants, upon
a charge of manslaughter following the verdict of a jury.

[Page 38]

The dissents as expressed in the formal judgment
are as follows:

Messieurs les juges Francœur
et Stuart McDougall,
dissidents, casseraient le verdict, annuleraient les sentences et ordonneraient
un nouveau procès; M. le juge Francœur pour les motifs suivants:

(a) Admission au cours du procès de preuve illégale;

(b) Direction erronée en droit sur
l'interprétation de l'article 69  du Code Criminel .

Stuart McDougall J., dissenting, being of opinion
that the verdict should be quashed and that a new trial should be ordered on
the grounds:

(a) that the accused were deprived
of their right to challenge peremptorily the number of jurors allowed by law;

(b) that the presiding judge
committed an error in law in instructing the jury that subsection 2  of section
69  of the Criminal Code  applied; and

(c) that the presiding judge further
erred in law in instructing the jury that evidence declared by him to be
irrelevant as to the guilt of the accused would be helpful and could be
accepted by the jury to indicate an atmosphere or ""climat spécial""
surrounding the actions of the accused.

The facts in substance are as follows:

The appellants, members of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, Lizotte being a temporary constable, had, on May 7, 1944,
together with another constable by the name of Massicotte and a corporal Dubé,
who was in charge, gone to the village of St. Lambert for the purpose of apprehending
the deceased, Georges Guénette, wanted on a charge of having conspired with
others to assist one Hervé Plante to escape from the custody of a peace
officer. A number of unsuccessful attempts, some ten or more it is said, had
already been made by the police to effect Guénette's arrest. On the day in
question, these constables and others had made an earlier trip to the village
and after having searched the premises of Guénette's father unsuccessfully, had
set out on the return to their headquarters in the city of Quebec. After proceeding some distance
toward Quebec, the four named
constables on the orders of Dubé turned about and went back to St. Lambert on the chance that Guénette
might have returned to his father's house thinking that the coast was clear.
The evidence indicates that Guénette had in fact, at the time of the earlier
visit, been sleeping in his father's barn, but had managed to make his escape.

[Page 39]

Corporal Dubé stationed Lizotte and Massicotte
outside the house, which was situated on the south side of a road known as the Brochu Road, while he himself entered the
house followed by Savard. While so engaged, Dubé's attention was attracted by a
sound upstairs and he proceeded up the stairs just in time to see Guénette jump
from a window on the west side of the house. Savard immediately ran from the
house in pursuit of Guénette who ran westerly through a ploughed field behind
the house extending for a distance of 255 feet to a fence which separated the
Guénette property from the property of Brochu, further to the west. Brochu's
land in turn extends some 300 feet to a river.

As Savard pursued Guénette, he says he was
losing ground, and as Guénette ignored his calls to stop, he fired four shots
in the air from the ·45 calibre revolver which he carried. As Guénette still
paid no attention, Savard says he lowered his revolver and fired toward a point
approximately 6 feet to the left of Guénette with the idea that the latter
would not only hear the bullet but see the spurt of the ground where it hit. At
this time, he was some 40 or 50 feet approximately in a direct line, parallel
with the road, behind Guénette. As Savard fired this fifth shot, Guénette was
in the act of jumping the fence into the Brochu field and as he reached the
other side, he appeared to bend forward with the left hand resting on the fence
and the right hand on the ground. He then straightened himself and ran somewhat
more toward the south, but still westerly, for a distance of approximately 78
feet where he stumbled and fell face down. According to the medical evidence,
he was then dead or died very shortly thereafter. This evidence by itself might
very well indicate that Savard's last bullet had hit Guénette. There is,
however, other evidence to be mentioned.

Lizotte had been stationed on the Brochu Road on the north side of the
Guénette house, while Massicotte had been instructed by Dubé to post himself in
a line with Lizotte on the south side of the house between the house and the
barn to the west. Massicotte, however, testified that these instructions had
been changed and that Dubé had assigned him to a post on the highway running
north

[Page 40]

and south, east of the Guénette house. This
change in instructions is, however, denied by Dubé. Lizotte, from his post on
the Brochu Road, on observing
Guénette jump from the window, tried to get over the fence separating the
Guénette property from the road but was unable to do so. He then ran westerly
on the road and fired one shot in the air and a second in a westerly direction
down the road toward a point, he says, approximately 30 to 35 feet to the north
of Guénette and to the latter's right. After he had fired these two shots, he
heard someone behind him say ""tire-le"" (shoot at him) and then a shot
from the same direction. At that moment, Guénette who had just jumped the fence
appeared to throw himself backwards. The words ""tire-le"" were also
heard by a Crown witness, Larochelle by name.

Massicotte's evidence is that, from his position
on the highway east of the house, he heard Lizotte call to someone and he,
Massicotte, thereupon ran after Savard in the field in pursuit of Guénette.
However, three other Crown witnesses, namely, Larochelle, Brochu and Guénette
Sr. describe having seen two constables running on the Brochu
 Road and both Dubé and Savard say they did not see
Massicotte in the field where Savard was. This evidence of Massicotte was
evidently regarded as so unsatisr factory by the Crown that Crown counsel told
the jury that Massicotte had not done as he said but had in fact run after
Lizotte on the Brochu Road.
Larochelle further testified that one of the two constables on the Brochu Road had lowered his arm and fired
in Guénette's direction and that the constable who did so was wearing a
soldier's cap. Lizotte was in civilian attire and bareheaded while Massicotte
was in uniform. There is evidence indicating that Lizotte's last shot and the
shot fired by Massicotte were both fired after Savard's fifth shot. The Crown
does not and did not at any time suggest that the words ""tire-le""
were spoken by Lizotte. Accordingly, if the evidence of Larochelle and Lizotte
is trustworthy on this point, these words must have been spoken by Massicotte.

When the body was examined by a doctor at the
hospital to which it was taken by the constables, Massicotte

[Page 41]

asked the doctor to insert at the penetration
point of the wound a ·45 and a ·38 calibre bullet. This was done and the doctor
then told Massicotte that it was a ·38 which had caused the death because that
bullet could be introduced more easily into the opening than the ·45. Both
Massicotte and Savard carried ·45's, while Lizotte carried a ·38. Before the
wound was further examined, the body was placed in the hands of an undertaker,
who sewed up the wound. One of the Crown experts, who later examined the body,
stated that in his opinion the bullet which caused the death was a ·45. The
experiment at the hospital by the doctor who first examined Guénette was not
communicated to Savard, who was evidently then of the opinion that it was a
bullet from his pistol which had caused the death. Savard said, however, that
he did not hear the words ""tire-le"" nor any shot after the fifth shot
he fired. He says that, when he heard shots from the Brochu
 Road, he called out to stop shooting.

The indictment charged that the appellants,

Ensemble et illégalement causé des lésions
corporelles qui ont entraîné la mort de Georges Guénette, commettant par là un
crime d'homicide involontaire.

It becomes important to observe the course followed
by the Crown's advisers and the way in which the case went to the jury. As
stated in the factum of the respondents, Crown counsel at the opening of the
trial declared expressly that the case fell within the provisions of section 69
(2)  of the Criminal Code , and it is common ground that the trial judge so
charged the jury on the request of counsel for the Crown so to do. The case did
not go to the jury in any sense as within the first subsection of section 69 .
As put by counsel for the respondent in their factum:

If there was evidence in the case that
Lizotte or Savard had been provoked, advised, aided or counselled to commit
that offence, it would have been the duty of the judge to quote and explain
that first part of section 69 . The judge did not think that the evidence in the
case justified him to do so. It is hard to say that he then, on this point,
made a mistake.

In the factum of the Crown it is also stated
that:—

It is established that the two accused not
only drew their revolvers and fired, pointing them at the sky, but also aimed
at Guénette.

[Page 42]

The Crown also submitted the evidence of the
witness Larochelle that a constable wearing a soldier's hat on the Brochu Road had fired at Guénette. As
already mentioned, this evidence, if accepted, points to Massicotte. Further,
it appears that the bullet which killed Guénette entered the body at the left
side of the back in the vicinity of the eleventh rib and passed out at the
level of the fourth rib some six inches higher, the direction of the bullet
through the body being to some degree from left to right. Guénette in jumping
the fence had placed one hand on the top rail and had vaulted over it with his
feet toward the Brochu Road. As
he reached the ground, his back might well have presented a target to a person
firing from the road quite consistent with the location and direction of the
wound, while it is not so easy, perhaps, to visualize how such a wound could
have been caused by a person in the position of Savard, who is said to have
been approximately in a straight line behind him. It is impossible, however, to
be dogmatic with regard to this matter, and this is the view taken by St.
Jacques J. in the Court of King's Bench.

The uncertainty as to the identity of the person
who had fired the fatal shot (only one bullet hit Guénette), and the fact that
the Crown did not suggest that Lizotte was the person who had used the words
""tire-le"" and that in the opinion of counsel for the Crown there was
no evidence that Lizotte or Savard had been ""provoked, advised, aided or
counselled"" to commit the offence were no doubt the considerations which
dictated the course followed in proceeding under subsection (2). This being the
view of the Crown's advisers, that course was not other than proper. The
important point is that the decision was made after full consideration of all
the facts and followed after all the evidence had been placed before the jury.

Section 69  reads as follows:

(1) Every one is a party to and guilty of
an offence who

(a) actually commits it;

(b) does or omits an act for the
purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence;

(c) abets any person in commission
of the offence; or

(d) counsels or procures any
person to commit the offence

(2) If several persons form a common
intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose, and to assist each other therein,
each of them is a party to every offence committed by any one of them in the
prosecution

[Page 43]

of such common purpose, the commission of
which offence was, or ought to have been known to be a probable consequence of
the prosecution of such common purpose.

In the course of his charge, the learned trial
judge read subsection 2 to the jury and told them in so many words that it
applied. He did not, however, explain the subsection or direct the jury as to
how it was to be applied to the facts in evidence according as they might
determine them to be. In so doing, he took away from the jury, in my opinion,
the question as to whether or not there was in fact any intention such as the
subsection requires. This appears more clearly from a reading of the charge, to
parts of which I will presently refer.

The theory of the Crown with regard to the
application of subsection (2) was that the appellants had formed a common
intention to bring about the arrest of Guénette by any means; that such
intention involved an unlawful purpose, namely, the use of force beyond the
limits permitted by section 43  of the Criminal Code ; and that it was immaterial
which of them actually fired the fatal shot, as the death of Guénette was or ought
to have been known to each of them to have been a probable consequence. I am
content, without determining the point, to deal with the case on the footing
that the subsection may be so applied.

The learned trial judge, as will appear, charged
the jury that there was no illegality in any way attaching to the appellants'
conduct that day prior to the moment when the actual firing commenced. The way
in which he told them it was open to them to convict from that time on I shall
now refer to. Counsel for the Crown who, as already stated, requested the
learned trial judge to charge on the basis of subsection (2), did not object to
the charge and must be taken to have been satisfied with it.

Coming to the charge itself, I quote:

Je crois, messieurs les jurés, que je vous ai
fait un résumé aussi fidèle que possible de la preuve, d'après les nombreuses
notes que j'ai prises et la transcription de certains témoignages. Je vous ai
exposé le droit suivant ce que je crois les principes du code, son sens
littéral, le sens commun et ma façon de lire la loi. C'est le cadre. Vous avez,
par les faits, le tableau, l'ambiance, l'atmosphère, le climat en un mot. C'est
à vous maintenant de décider si les accusés sont coupables ou non. Je vous

[Page 44]

le répète: vous êtes maîtres des faits, et si
je les avais rapportés erronément, vous n'êtes pas tenus de me suivre. C'est
votre opinion, c'est votre conviction seule qui compte.

Les accusés ont-ils, usant de leur discrétion,
suivant les ordres reçus, abusé de leur port d'armes, et aux termes de la loi,
fait un excès de violence?

Les accusés auraient-ils pu opérer
l'arrestation, comme dit le code, par des moyens raisonnables, sans recourir à
violence? Les accusés auraient-ils pu arrêter Georges Guénette ce matin-là, en
le cernant, en se jetant sur lui, sans recourir aux armes à feu? Ont-ils été négligents, de négligence grossière
et ont-ils dépassé les limites de leurs pouvoirs, en se servant de revolvers,
qui, sous prétexte de l'avertir, le couchèrent dans un champ et lui enlevèrent
la vie? Georges Guénette pouvait-il se sauver bien loin, seul contre quatre
gendarmes armés et qui avaient avec eux une automobile? Si vous en venez à
cette conclusion, qui est uniquement de votre province, vous devez les trouver
coupables, suivant l'accusation portée.

Les accusés ont-ils fait leur devoir, sont-ils
restés dans les limites de la loi, n'ont-ils commis aucun excès, est-ce un
accident? Si vous en venez à cette conclusion, vous devez les acquitter.

Devez-vous trouver une différence de
responsabilité entre l'accusé Savard et l'accusé Lizotte, si vous en venez au
verdict de culpabilité?

C'est ici que l'article 69 du Code Pénal, paragraphe 2, à son application:

""Quand plusieurs personnes forment
ensemble le projet de faire quelque chose d'illégal et de s'entraider dans ce
projet, chacune d'elles est complice de toute infraction commise par l'une
d'entre elles dans la poursuite de leur but commun, si elles savaient ou
devaient savoir que la commission de cette infraction devait être la
conséquence probable de la poursuite de leur but commun.""

Me Gendron soutient que cet article ne
s'applique pas. Malheureusement, je ne puis partager son opinion. Le paragraphe
2 s'applique. L'illégalité
commença au moment où ils, les accusés et le constable Massicotte, se mirent ensemble à tirer dans la poursuite de leur but
commun, contrairement à la loi, si vous jugez qu'ils abusèrent de la violence.

L'entente est devenue illégale au cours de
l'exécution, toujours si les accusés excédèrent, d'après vous, les moyens raisonnables
et causèrent la mort—article 43  C. Cr.

Il me reste à vous dire que le doute est en
faveur des accusés. Quand on parle de doute, il faut que ce soit un doute
raisonnable qui entraîne la conviction, c'est-à-dire, que si vous n'êtes pas
logiquement et raisonnablement sûrs que les accusés soient coupables, votre
devoir est de les acquitter.

In the above, the jury are told these four
things:

(1) If they thought that the appellants could
have effected the arrest by means other than by resorting to their firearms or
if they were guilty of gross negligence in resorting to their firearms, they
had gone beyond the limits of section 43  Cr. C. and the jury must find them
guilty as charged.

[Page 45]

(2) If, in the opinion of the jury, the
appellants did not exceed the limits of section 43 , Cr. C. then the death was
an accident and the appellants should be acquitted.

(3) They need not differentiate between Savard
and Lizotte in arriving at their verdict under (1) above in view of the
provisions of section 69 (2) .

(4) The unlawful intention within the meaning of
subsection 2 arose when the appellants started to fire, if, in the opinion of
the jury, the appellants transgressed the limits of section 43 .

Section 43  Cr. C. is as follows:

Every one proceeding lawfully to arrest any
person for any cause other than an offence in the last section mentioned is
justified, if the person to be arrested takes to flight to avoid arrest, in
using such force as may be necessary to prevent his escape by flight, unless
such escape can be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner, if
such force is neither intended nor likely to cause death or grevious bodily
harm.

Assuming that the theory of the Crown as
previously set out correctly interprets the provisions of section 69 (2)  as
applied to the case at bar, the question of fact as to the existence or
non-existence of a common wrongful intention on the part of the appellants was
completely taken away from the jury by the charge. They were told that the
guilt of the appellants was dependent merely upon a finding that the appellants
had gone beyond that which is authorized by section 43 . This, of course, is
completely erroneous and sufficient of itself to vitiate the verdict and direct
a new trial.

However, in my opinion, that course cannot be
followed as it is impossible to find in the record any evidence supporting the
existence of a common intention on the part of the appellants to prosecute any
unlawful purpose within the meaning of subsection (2) even had the jury been
properly charged. The learned trial judge charged the jury, as already
mentioned, and I think correctly, that there was no illegality until the
instant when the firing commenced. Accepting that, I agree with the learned
dissenting judges in the court below that there is nothing from which it can be
established that either of the appellants acted other than independently and as
a result of the circumstances which came into existence during the attempt to
make the arrest after Guénette

[Page 46]

was sighted. There is no evidence upon which a
finding could be made that the appellants formed at that time any common
wrongful intention as required by the subsection.

Notwithstanding the position taken by the Crown
at the trial, Mr. Rivard now argues that there was evidence showing that the
appellants had formed a wrongful intention prior to the time when the firing
commenced.

For the purpose of showing that the whole
expedition was illegal, Mr. Rivard endeavoured to make use of the fact that
the constables did not have with them the warrant for Guénette's arrest. The
evidence shows that this was due to a mistake on the part of corporal Dubé.
Unknown to him, the file at headquarters had been split into two parts, and,
when leaving Quebec for St. Lambert, he had picked up what he thought was the
complete file, but in fact, the papers he took with him did not include the
warrant. However, the learned trial judge told the jury that this fact made no
difference so far as the appellants were concerned and specifically instructed
the jury that, in considering their verdict, they were to leave the question of
the presence or absence of the warrant out of consideration. I think the
learned trial judge was right and I do not think, therefore, that any point can
be made of this.

Mr. Rivard next called our attention to an
incident which occurred when the constables arrived at the village in the early
morning for the first time. An automobile was observed by Dubé on the village
street and he gave chase. After some trouble, he managed to place his car in
its path and to bring it to a stop. Some conversation took place between the
occupants of the two cars, and one Baillargeon, the driver of the other
automobile, deposed at the trial that one of the constables, he would not say
which, in the course of this conversation had said that if Baillargeon had not
stopped the constables would have fired. There is some question as to whether
this conversation took place in the presence of Savard, but I am content to
assume his presence. The learned trial judge charged the jury that legally this
conversation had no bearing upon the case, but he told the jury it was a
circumstance which might give them what the learned

[Page 47]

trial judge called the ""atmosphere"" or
""special climate"" of the case. This was, in my opinion, highly
improper. The incident was either evidence against the appellants or it was
not. There is no middle ground and the charge of the learned judge on this
point amounts to a direction that the jury might draw a conclusion unfavourable
to the accused from something which was not evidence at all. In my opinion, the
learned trial judge was right in holding that the incident was inadmissible as
evidence.

Mr. Rivard now seeks to use this incident for
the purpose of his present argument, namely, as showing the existence of a
common wrongful intention on the part of the appellants prior to the moment of
the firing. If in fact such an intention did exist at that time, then it must
have been on the part of Dubé and Massicotte and Savard, who were in the police
car at the time. Lizotte was not in that car but was in the other car with
three other constables in another part of the village. If Lizotte was also a
party to this wrongful intention, surely the other constables in the car with
him must also have been parties. It is remarkable, therefore, if Mr. Rivard be
right, why none of the other constables, and more especially why Dubé and
Massicotte, were not charged. It seems apparent that this contention is an
afterthought. It was not entertained by counsel for the Crown when the case was
placed before the jury.

Apart from this, this incident has no relevancy
to the charge upon which the appellants were tried. The argument is that when
the remark was made, the constables thought that Guénette might have been in
the Baillargeon car, and if they were willing to fire then, it would be some
evidence, the weight being for the jury, that they intended to fire later when
they did in fact sight Guénette and he did not stop. The incident is not
capable of being the foundation for the inference sought to be drawn from it.
There is nothing in the remark which would properly permit the inference to be
drawn that the firing would be with intent to do other than warn, and the
Crown's case would not be advanced.

The third circumstance relied upon by Mr. Rivard
in support of his argument was a conversation between one of the constables and
a Miss Fontaine, which took place also

[Page 48]

at the time of the first visit to the village,
while some of the constables were engaged in searching the home of her father.
Miss Fontaine said to this constable something to the effect that the
constables were tiring themselves that morning. His reply, according to Miss
Fontaine, was to the effect that that might be so, but others would soon be
tired. This evidence, in my opinion, was also inadmissible. Neither of the
appellants were present when the words were spoken. The trial judge permitted
this evidence to be given but directed the jury that it did not incriminate the
appellants and that they were not responsible for something spoken when they
were not present. Following this, however, he told the jury that it was for
them to decide whether or not the words were spoken. This was equally
objectionable to his treatment of the Baillargeon incident. Even if it were the
fact that both appellants were present when the statement was made, the
statement, in my opinion, is completely colourless and innocuous, and incapable
of being the basis of an inference that there was on the part of the appellants
any such intention as is now contended for.

In my opinion, therefore, as already stated,
there is no evidence anywhere to support the argument now put forward by Mr.
Rivard.

When a conviction is set aside on the ground
that there is no evidence to support it, the result ordinarily is that the
accused must be acquitted. The Crown contends, however, that there should be a
new trial, and, of course, that is what is directed by the dissenting
judgments. The argument is that the appellants should now be proceeded against
at the proposed new trial under section 69 (1) or, that additional evidence
might be forthcoming which would make section 69 (2)  applicable. Such an order,
however, cannot be made. Section 1024  provides:

(1) The Supreme Court of Canada shall make
such rule or order thereon, either in affirmance of the conviction or for
granting a new trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such
application, as the justice of the case requires, and shall make all other
necessary rules and orders for carrying such rule or order into effect.

(2) Unless such appeal is brought on for
hearing by the appellant at the session of the Supreme Court of Canada during
which such affirmance takes place, or the session next thereafter if the said
court is not then in session, the appeal shall be held to have been abandoned,
unless otherwise ordered by the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof.

[Page 49]

(3) The judgment of the Supreme Court of
Canada shall, in all cases, be final and conclusive.

(4) Notwithstanding any royal prerogative,
or anything contained in the Interpretation Act or in the Supreme Court Act, no
appeal shall be brought in any criminal case from any judgment or order of any
court in Canada to any court of appeal or authority, by which in the United
Kingdom appeals or petitions to His Majesty in Council may be heard.

While the existence of a dissent on a question
of law, as provided by section 1023, is a condition precedent for an appeal to
this Court, in a case like the present, this Court, once seized of the appeal
is not limited to the remedy considered appropriate in the dissent, but has
complete jurisdiction to direct the remedy which, in its opinion, the Court
appealed from ought to have granted. In Manchuk v. The King[4], Duff CJ.C. said:

We have concluded after full consideration
that by force of section 1024  coupled with the enactments of the Supreme
Court Act this Court has authority not only to order a new trial or to
quash the conviction and direct the discharge of the prisoner. * * *

Having this jurisdiction then, what is the duty
of the Court in the circumstances here present? In my opinion it would not be
proper to direct a new trial. Even had the jury been properly instructed under
section 69 (2) , there is no evidence, as I have pointed out, upon which the
appellants could properly have been convicted. The case was deliberately
proceeded with upon a theory of guilt under a certain provision of the Criminal
Code  which now turns out to be one which the evidence entirely fails to justify.
Merely because it is suggested that upon some other possible view of the
evidence some other provision of the Code might apply (which the Crown
deliberately determined at the trial did not apply), or because the Crown might
be able to adduce further evidence are not circumstances which would make it
proper to do otherwise than to acquit. I think the principle of the decision in
Wexler v. The King[5]
prevents our making such an order as the Crown now asks for. I would therefore
allow the appeal and quash the convictions. It is not necessary in the
circumstances that I deal with any of the other grounds of dissent.

Appeal allowed, convictions quashed and
appellants discharged.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA, IN BANCO

Criminal law—Theft of case of cigarettes—Accused
peddling cigarettes—Circumstantial evidence—Misdirection as to rule in Hodge's
case—Suspicion—Doctrine of recent possession—Criminal Code , 1953–54 (Can.), c. 51,
s. 296.

[Page 411]

A wholesale store in Truro, N.S., was broken into on the night
of January 24, 1960, and nine cases of cigarettes were reported missing. The
three accused were charged and tried separately by the same magistrate for
unlawfully possessing a quantity of cigarettes, knowing that they were obtained
by the commission of an indictable offence, contrary to s. 296 (a) of the Criminal
Code . The evidence disclosed that they were trying to dispose of a case
containing 49 cartons of cigarettes of an unidentified brand in a neighbourhood
town on the day following the break-in, and that they were travelling in a
two-tone 1956 Buick convertible, with Ontario licence plates. A two-tone car,
with Ontario licence plates, containing two occupants whom the police could not
identify, had been seen in the area near the store on the evening of January
24. The evidence of the police was that all the nine cases were returned; the
owner's evidence was that eight cases were recovered and that the missing case
contained Player's Cigarettes. Accused Β and Κ stated that they never had any cigarettes in their
possession, but that they were endeavouring to dispose of some on behalf of
another person. The magistrate convicted the accused, basing his reasoning on
the express finding that the cigarettes they were trying to sell had been
stolen by them from the wholesale store. The convictions were affirmed by the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco. The accused were granted leave
to appeal to this Court upon certain questions of law.

Held: The appeals should be allowed, the convictions
quashed and the accused acquitted.

There was no direct evidence that the cigarettes were in the
possession of anyone other than the true owners. There was, however, no doubt
that the three accused were attempting to dispose of cartons of unidentified
cigarettes. This was a circumstance to be weighed by the magistrate, together
with the other circumstances disclosed by the evidence in accordance with the
rule in Hodge's case. The magistrate had misdirected himself in applying
this rule. The evidence of any cigarettes having been stolen at all was at best
equivocal, and there was no evidence of the kind of cigarettes tendered for
sale by the accused. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the accused Β or A were in that area on the previous night. It was
undoubtedly suspicious to find these men driving a two-tone 1956 Buick with
Ontario licence plates and peddling cigarettes, but suspicion is not a
substitute for proof and the convictions on circumstantial evidence appeared to
be based upon a misconception of the rule in Hodge's case. The
magistrate had erred in proceeding on the assumption that the accused had
admitted having been in the area together on the night of the break-in. The
doctrine of recent possession could not apply to the case, since the magistrate
had based his decision on the express finding that the accused had themselves
stolen the cigarettes in question. The further submission that the appeals
should be dismissed because no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had
occurred, failed for lack of evidence.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia in banco, affirming the accused convictions. Appeals allowed.

L. L. Pace and Chas. W. MacIntosh, for
the appellants. Malachi C. Jones, for the respondent.

[Page 412]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Ritchie J.:—These
three appeals were heard together. The three appellants were charged and tried
separately by the same Magistrate for unlawfully having in possession at or
near Amherst, Nova Scotia, on January 25, 1960,

… a quantity of cigarettes, the property of Truro
Wholesalers Limited, knowing that it was obtained by the commission of an
offence punishable by indictment contrary to s. 296 (a) of the Criminal Code .

The evidence taken against Boss was used by consent in the other
two cases, and the evidence given by Kline in his own defence was similarly
used in the case of Arsenault.

In each case the evidence discloses that these three men
were trying to dispose of a case containing 49 cartons of cigarettes of an
unidentified brand at Amherst on the 25th of January, and that they were then
travelling in a two-tone 1956 Buick convertible with Ontario license plates,
but the evidence does not indicate that cigarettes were found in the possession
of any of the appellants, and it is stated by both Boss and Kline that they had
never had any cigarettes in their possession but that they were endeavouring to
dispose of some on behalf of another person.

Coupled with this evidence is the fact that on the morning
of January 25 the secretary-treasurer of Truro Wholesalers Limited found that
his store had been broken into, and that, as far as he could tell from his
records, one full case containing 50 cartons of cigarettes was missing and that
marks in the snow which had fallen during the night before indicated that a
case of Player's cigarettes had been put out and taken away. In this latter
regard the same secretary-treasurer states that there were originally nine
cases missing of which eight were recovered, whereas the police officer concerned
swears that nine cases were returned to Truro Wholesalers Limited.

The other circumstance strongly relied upon by the Crown was
the fact that an Ontario two-tone 1956 convertible Buick containing two
occupants whom the police could not identify was seen in Truro near Truro
Wholesalers Limited on the evening of January 24.

[Page 413]

In a statement made to the police which was produced at his
trial, Boss said that he had been in Truro with the other two appellants on the
25th of January, but denied knowing about the break, and Kline, giving evidence
at his own trial, stated that he was in Truro on the evening of the 24th in a
two-tone 1956 Buick convertible of a different shade from that described by the
two police officers, but did not name either of the other appellants as his
companion.

In convicting each of the appellants it is quite apparent
that the learned Magistrate based his reasoning on the express finding that the
cigarettes which these men were trying to sell in Amherst on the 25th of
January had been stolen by them from Truro Wholesalers Limited. He says, in
convicting Boss, ""I have to find that these fellows stole them in order to
convict them"", and in convicting the other two appellants, ""In this
case I am well satisfied that they not only had possession of them but that
they are the thieves"".

In appealing from these convictions to the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia en banc, each of the appellants gave notice of appeal on the
following, amongst other, grounds:

1. There was not sufficient evidence presented at the trial
to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the offence
charged.

2. The learned Magistrate did not give the accused the
benefit of reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

3. The learned Magistrate failed to comprehend or to apply
the rules of law applicable to circumstantial evidence.

4. The conviction is against the weight of evidence and the
proper application of the evidence.

The decision of the Supreme Court en banc was
rendered by Ilsley C. J. who found:

1. THAT there was evidence in the proceedings against Boss
(admissible only against Boss) on which the learned Magistrate could properly
find, as he did, that Boss jointly participated with Kline in the theft of a
case of cigarettes at Truro from Truro Wholesalers Limited;

2. THAT in the proceedings against Kline there was evidence
(admissible only against Kline) that Kline jointly participated with Boss in
the same theft;

[Page 414]

3. THAT there was evidence in each of the three cases that
later, in Amherst, each of the three appellants had, jointly with the others,
possession of or control over this case of cigarettes less one carton, or aided
in concealing or disposing of it;

4. THAT at that time Boss and Kline must, of course, each
have known that the cigarettes had been stolen;

5. THAT the evidence in the proceedings against Arsenault
was sufficient to justify the Magistrate in properly inferring that Arsenault
also knew that they had been stolen; and

6. THAT each of the explanations given by Boss and Kline was
one which the Magistrate was quite justified in finding not to be an
explanation that could reasonably be true.

From this judgment the appellants sought leave to appeal to
this Court, and by Order dated December 19, 1960, leave was granted upon the
following questions of law:

1. Did the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc err in
failing to hold that the learned magistrate misdirected himself on the law in
his application of the rule relating to circumstantial evidence known as the
rule in Hodge's case?

2. Did the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc err in
failing to hold that there was no evidence against the appellants to sustain a
conviction?

3. Did the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc err in
failing to hold that the learned magistrate misdirected himself as to the
doctrine of recent possession of stolen goods?

4. Did the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc err in
failing to hold that the learned magistrate misdirected himself as to the
doctrine of reasonable doubt?

The offence here charged is complete when a person has
(alone or with another person) possession of or control over goods which he
knows to have been obtained by the commission of an indictable offence or when
he aids in concealing or disposing of such goods (see s. 300  of the Criminal
Code ).

In the present case, while there is no direct evidence of
""a quantity of cigarettes, the property of Truro Wholesalers
Limited"", being in the possession of anyone other than the true owner,
there is no doubt that the three appellants were attempting to dispose of 49
cartons of unidentified cigarettes in Amherst on January 25. This was a
circumstance to be weighed by the Magistrate, together with the other
circumstances disclosed by the evidence in accordance with the rule of law
which has come to be known as

[Page 415]

the rule in Hodge's case1 and
which was expressed by Sir Lyman Duff, speaking on behalf of this Court in The
King v. Comba2, where he said:

It is admitted by the Crown, as the fact is, that the
verdict rests solely upon a basis of circumstantial evidence. In such cases, by
the long settled rule of the common law, which is the rule of law in Canada,
the jury, before finding a prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must be
satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with a conclusion that
the criminal act was committed by the accused, but also that the facts are such
as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused
is the guilty person.

To this statement there should be added what was said
by Cartwright J. in Lizotte v. The King3, as follows:

Hodge's case was a case where all the evidence against
the accused was circumstantial. It is argued that the direction there
prescribed is not necessary in a case where there is direct evidence against
the accused as well as circumstantial evidence. However that may be, it is my
opinion that where the proof of any essential ingredient of the offence charged
depends upon circumstantial evidence it is necessary that the direction be
given.

In the course of his reasons in the case of Boss which he
applied to the other two cases, the learned Magistrate is reported, according
to the record before this Court, as having stated the rule in the following
language:

If they (the Crown) had to prove they were stolen and these
people knew they were stolen, there would be no sense in rule in Hodge's case.
The rule in Hodge's case is the rule that circumstantial evidence, if no other
reasonable explanation they are in their possession, then they are guilty.

If the learned Magistrate was correctly reported, as we must
take him to have been, he misdirected himself in this regard, but it is not so
much the language which he is reported to have used as the manner in which he
applied the rule which is of importance in determining the disposition of these
appeals.

It is an essential ingredient of the offences charged that
it should at least be proved that cigarettes were missing from Truro
Wholesalers Limited, and as to this phase of the matter the opening words of
the learned Magistrate's reasons for judgment are significant. He there says:

I must say there is a bit of doubt as to whether any
cigarettes were missing at all. According to the evidence as far as Nichols
(Secretary-Treasurer of Truro Wholesalers Limited) is concerned he said
according to his records it looked as though there were nine cases of
cigarettes missing and they recovered eight. I think the Detective said they
recovered nine.

[Page 416]

The secretary-treasurer stated that as far as he could tell
there was one full case missing, and when asked to explain this statement he
said:

We keep a record of our stock, sir, and as far as we could
tell from our records there was one full case missing and evidence of one case
being put over a fence. The mark of the imprint was there in the snow.
Therefore, that case would have to be put down in the snow and taken away by some
one.

The evidence of any cigarettes having been stolen at
all is, therefore, at best equivocal, and although the secretary-treasurer adds
that as far as he could tell the imprint in the snow was that of a case of
Player's cigarettes, there is no evidence whatever of the kind of cigarettes
tendered for sale in Amherst. There is no evidence that either Boss or
Arsenault were in Truro on the night of the 24th of January, the police were
unable to identify any of the appellants as the men seen in the Buick near
Truro Wholesalers Limited that evening, and Kline says that the Buick he was in
that night was a different colour from that described by the police.

It was undoubtedly suspicious to find these men driving a
two-tone 1956 Buick with Ontario license plates and peddling cigarettes in
Amherst the day after a break into premises at Truro from which cigarettes were
thought to have been missing and outside of which a similar car had been seen
on the night of the break, but suspicion is not a substitute for proof, and
insofar as these convictions rest upon circumstantial evidence, they appear to
me to be based in large measure on the misconception of the rule in Hodge's case
to which reference has been made. In my opinion, if the learned Magistrate had
properly directed himself as to the law in his application of the rule in Hodge's
case to the circumstances here disclosed, he would have concluded that
there was no evidence to sustain a conviction against these appellants.

It should be pointed out, however, that the Magistrate
appears to have proceeded on the assumption that the appellants admitted having
been in Truro together on the night of the break. In this he was in error.

As the learned Magistrate based his decision on the express
finding that the appellants had themselves stolen the cigarettes in question,
there was no room for the

[Page 417]

application of the ""doctrine of recent possession""
which is directed to the question of whether or not an accused who is found to
be in possession of goods recently stolen is aware of the fact that they are
stolen goods nor indeed is there any occasion to invoke this doctrine on the
view which I take of these cases because, as I have indicated, I do not
consider that the evidence is of a kind upon which it is safe to base a finding
that there were cigarettes missing from Truro Wholesalers Limited.

It is argued on behalf of the respondent that
notwithstanding the errors in law which there may have been in the trial of
these cases, the appeals should nevertheless be dismissed on the ground that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred. The test to be
applied to this argument is to be found in the decision of Viscount Simon in Stirland
v. Director of Public Prosecutions4, the following portion of which
was adopted by this Court in Schmidt v. The King5:

… the provision that the Court of Criminal Appeal may
dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice
has actually occurred in convicting the accused assumes a situation where a
reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would on the evidence properly
admissible, without doubt convict.

I am of opinion, with the greatest respect, that there
was no evidence upon which the learned Magistrate could properly find that Boss
and Kline jointly participated in the theft of this case of cigarettes or that
the appellants had possession of it or aided in concealing or disposing of it
with knowledge that it had been stolen.

The judgment of this Court has already been rendered
allowing these appeals, quashing the convictions and directing verdicts of
acquittal to be entered.

Appeals allowed, convictions quashed and
verdicts of acquittal ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA In Banco

Criminal law—Habitual criminal—Application for
preventive detention of accused as an habitual criminal—7 clear days notice to
be given accused—Time when notice to be given—Evidence of persistent criminal
life—Whether trial judge entitled to look at evidence leading to conviction on
substantive offence—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 660, 662.

The accused was convicted on the charge of breaking and
entering and committing theft. On the day of his conviction, but before the
time set for the sentencing, notice was given by the Crown that an application
would be made 10 days later to impose upon him a sentence of preventive
detention on the ground that he was an habitual criminal. The notice set out
prior convictions and alleged that the accused was leading persistently a
criminal life. A period of 25 months had elapsed since the accused was released
from imprisonment for the last of these offences and his commission of the
substantive offence in the present case. The trial judge found the accused to
be an habitual criminal and took into consideration the nature and
circumstances surrounding the commission of the substantive offence. This
judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco. The
accused appealed to this Court.

[Page 512]

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

1. Notice of the application required by s. 662(1)  (a)
(ii) of the Criminal Code  may be given at any time that allows 7 clear
days before the application and is also before the day of sentence on the
substantive offence. There is nothing in the present Criminal Code  to
preclude such notice being initiated, as it was in the present case, by the
giving of 7 days notice after conviction but before sentencing, although notice
given 7 days before the trial, as was done under the provisions of the former
Code, would still be valid as this would necessarily be 7 days before the
conviction and therefore before the time of making the application. R. v.
Stepanoff, 33 C.R. 273, overruled.

2. The object of the notice is to prevent the accused from
being taken by surprise as to the circumstances upon which the Crown intends to
rely, but as the statute makes consideration of the substantive conviction a
prerequisite to the hearing of the application, the Court is entitled to treat
it as a material circumstance in reaching its conclusion on the merit of the
application, whether such conviction is specifically mentioned in the notice or
not. The trial judge, in reaching his conclusion, was fully justified in
considering the conviction for the substantive offence and the circumstances
surrounding it in light of the accused's past record. The finding of the trial
judge should not be disturbed, as the nature of the substantive offence which
was not only carefully planned but was similar in nature to four other crimes
for which the accused had been previously convicted, was in itself evidence
that he was leading persistently a criminal life.

3. The fact that a conviction which had not been specified in
the notice of application and which had occurred before the appellant was 18
years of age, was wrongly admitted together with evidence of an acquittal, did
not influence or prejudice the trial judge against the accused.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia in banco1,
affirming a judgment of Ilsley C.J. Appeal dismissed.

L. L. Pace and Chas. W. MacIntosh,
for the appellant.

Malachi C. Jones, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Ritchie J.:—This
is an appeal brought by leave of this Court from a judgment of the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia en banc1 affirming the finding of Ilsley C.J.
that the appellant was an habitual criminal and the consequent imposition of a
sentence of preventive detention pursuant to the provisions of s. 660  of the Criminal
Code .

[Page 513]

On February 5, 1960, the appellant was convicted on an
indictment charging that he did

... on or about the 6th day of December, 1959, unlawfully
break and enter the store of H. G. Guild Limited,
situate at Musquodoboit and did there and then commit the indictable offence of
theft contrary to Section 292  of the Criminal Code .

On the day of the conviction but before the time had arrived
for considering the question of sentence thereon, the appellant was served by
the prosecutor with notice that an application would be made to the Court on
the 15th of February to impose upon him a sentence of preventive detention on
the ground that he was an habitual criminal. This notice specified seven separate
and independent occasions on which the appellant, since attaining eighteen
years of age, had been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was
liable to imprisonment for five years or more and proceeded to allege that the
appellant practised no trade or profession, lived without employment on the
proceeds of crime and was leading persistently a criminal life.

At the hearing held before the Chief Justice pursuant to
this notice, the Crown produced the very considerable criminal record of the appellant,
and in the course of so doing inadvertently introduced evidence of a conviction
and an acquittal which had not been mentioned in the notice. At this hearing
evidence was given by police officers that the appellant had been under police
surveillance since his last release from prison in October 1957, that he had no
regular employment, and that his general reputation in the community where he
lived was not good, but there was no suggestion that he had been convicted or
even arrested between the time of his last release and the time when he
committed the substantive offence and it appeared that he had made some money
by selling beer bottles to the Nova Scotia Liquor Commission.

In determining that the appellant was an habitual criminal
and sentencing him accordingly, the learned Chief Justice undoubtedly took into
account the nature and circumstances of the offence of which he had just been
convicted which is hereinafter referred to as ""the substantive
offence"".

[Page 514]

In dismissing the appellant's appeal from this
determination, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc held that, having
regard to the nature of the substantive offence and the circumstances of
preparation, planning and deliberation which accompanied it, the evidence as a
whole supported the conclusion that the accused was leading persistently a
criminal life and found that the Chief Justice had not been influenced by the
fact that the evidence of an acquittal and a conviction referred to above had
been admitted at the hearing.

In holding that the notice of the application required by s.
662(1)  (a) (ii) of the Criminal Code  ""may be given at
any time that allows seven clear days before the application and is also before
the day of sentence on the substantive offence"", Mr. Justice Doull had
occasion to state: 

I am quite clear that it (the notice) is sufficient and I am
of opinion that R. v. Stepanoff (32 C.R. 362) was wrongly decided by
following words of the former Act which have now been carefully omitted and by
reading Section 662(a) (ii) as if it were the same as former Section
575C(4)(b).

The case of R. v. Stepanoff2 to which the learned judge
referred was a decision of Lazure J. of the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench,
Crown Side, which was subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal3, holding that ""the notice
called for in s. 662 must be given before the trial on the primary charge
commences"". In the course of his reasons for judgment on appeal Mr.
Justice Hyde said at p. 276:

There is nothing in the terms of these sections of the new
Code indicating any reason for a change in the practice followed under the old
one. Furthermore, as the learned trial judge points out in his notes, the
economy of our criminal law requires that an accused shall know before he makes
his plea the exact nature of the charge with which he is faced and the
consequences thereof.

As a conflict plainly exists between the Appellate Courts of
Nova Scotia and Quebec respecting the very important question of the time at
which notice of application for imposition of the sentence of preventive
detention is to be initiated and as the difference of opinion turns in some
degree on the wording of both the present Criminal Code 

[Page 515]

and that of c. 55 of the Statutes of Canada, 1947, it will
perhaps be convenient to consider the relevant provisions of these two statutes
together:


 
  
  THE PRESENT
  CRIMINAL
  CODE
  
  
  CHAPTER 55,
  STATUTES OF CANADA, 1947
  
 
 
  
  660. (1) Where an accused is con-
  victed of an indictable offence the
  court may, upon application, impose
  a sentence of preventive detention
  in addition to any sentence that is
  imposed for the offence of which he
  is convicted if
  (a) the accused is found to be
  an
  habitual criminal, and
  (b) the court is of the
  opinion
  that because the accused is
  an habitual criminal, it is
  expedient for the protection
  of the public to sentence him
  to preventive detention.
  
  
  575B. Where a person is convicted
  of an indictable offence committed
  after the commencement of this
  Part and subsequently the offender
  admits that he is or is found by a
  jury or a judge to be a habitual
  criminal, and the court passes a
  sentence upon the said offender, the
  court, if it is of the opinion that,
  by reason of his criminal habits and
  mode of life, it is expedient for the
  protection of the public, may pass
  a further sentence ordering that he
  be detained in a prison for an inde-
  terminate period and such detention
  is hereinafter referred to as preven-
  tive detention and the person on
  whom such a sentence is passed
  shall be deemed for the purpose of
  this Part to be a habitual criminal.
  
 
 
  
  660. (2) For the purposes of
  sub-
  section (1), an accused is an habit-
  ual criminal if
  (a) he has previously, since
  at-
  taining the age of eighteen
  years, on at least three
  separate and independent
  occasions been convicted of
  an indictable offence for
  which he was liable to im-
  prisonment for five years or
  more and is leading per-
  sistently a criminal life, or
  (b) he has been previously sen-
  tenced to preventive deten-
  tion.
  
  
  575C. (1) A person shall not
  be
  found to be a habitual criminal
  unless the judge or jury as the case
  may be, finds on evidence,
  (a) that since attaining the
  age
  of eighteen years he has at
  least three times previously to
  the conviction of the crime
  charged in the indictment,
  been convicted of an indict-
  able offence for which he was
  liable to at least five years'
  imprisonment, whether any
  such previous conviction was
  before or after the commence-
  ment of this Part, and that
  he is leading persistently a
  criminal life; or
  (b) that he has on a previous
  conviction been found to be
  a habitual criminal and sen-
  tenced to preventive deten-
  tion.
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  575C. (2) In any indictment
  under this section it shall be suffi-
  cient, after charging the crime, to
  state that the offender is a habitual
  criminal.
  
 
 
  
  [Page 516]
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
  662.(1) The following
  provisions
  apply with respect to applications
  under this Part, namely
  (a) an application under subsec-
  tion (1) of section 660  shall
  not be heard unless
  (i) the Attorney General of
  the province in which the
  accused is to be tried
  consents,
  (ii) seven clear days' notice
  has been given to the
  accused by the prosecutor
  specifying the previous
  convictions and the other
  circumstances, if any,
  upon which it is intended
  to found the application,
  and
  (iii) a copy of the notice has
  been filed with the clerk
  of the court or the magis-
  trate, as the case may be,
  662. (2) An application under this
  Part shall be heard and determined
  before sentence is passed for the
  offence of which the accused is con-
  victed and shall be heard by the
  court without a jury.
  662. (3) For the purposes of sec-
  tion 660, where the accused admits
  the allegations contained in the
  notice referred to in paragraph (a)
  of subsection (1), no proof of those
  allegations is required.
  
  
  575C. (3) In the proceedings
  on
  the indictment the offender shall in
  the first instance be arraigned only
  on so much of the indictment as
  charges the crime, and if on arraign-
  ment he pleads guilty or is found
  guilty by the judge or jury, as the
  case may be, unless he thereafter
  pleads guilty to being a habitual
  criminal, the judge or jury shall be
  charged to enquire whether or not
  he is a habitual criminal and in that case it shall not be necessary to
  swear the jury again.
  575C. (4) A person shall not be
  tried on a charge of being a habitual
  criminal unless
  (a) the Attorney General of
  the
  province in which the accused
  is to be tried consents there-
  to; and
  (b) not less than seven days'
  notice has been given by the
  proper officer of the court by
  which the offender is to be
  tried and the notice to the
  offender shall specify the pre-
  vious convictions and the
  other grounds upon which it
  is intended to found the
  charge.
  
 


In the 1947 statute these sections are grouped under the
heading ""PART X(A) HABITUAL CRIMINALS"" whereas the sections of the
present Code appear in Part XXI under the heading ""PREVENTIVE
DETENTION"". That these headings reflect a basic difference in approach to
the question with which both enactments are concerned can be seen from the fact
that the 1947 statute provides for a trial ""on a charge of being a
habitual criminal"" whereas the proceeding for which provision is made in
the present Criminal Code  is the hearing and determination of an

[Page 517]

application to impose a sentence of preventive detention. The following
differences between these two enactments are at once apparent:

1. Under the 1947 statute the method of bringing the matter
before the Court was to include in the indictment for the substantive offence a
statement that ""the offender is a habitual criminal"" (s. 575C(2)) whereas under the present Code the matter is to
be raised by an application to impose a sentence of preventive detention (s.
660(1)).

2. Under the 1947 statute the decision as to whether or not
a sentence of preventive detention was to be imposed was not to be made until
after sentence had been passed for the substantive offence (s.
575B) whereas under the present Code the application for imposition of
such sentence is to be heard and determined before sentence is passed on the
substantive offence (s. 662(2)).

3. Under the 1947 statute the issue of whether or not the
accused is an habitual criminal may be tried by a jury (s. 575C(3)) whereas
under the present Code the application to impose preventive detention is to be
heard by the Court without a jury (s. 662(2)).

The case of Brusch v. The Queen4 clearly establishes that
""the charge of being a habitual criminal"" referred to in s. 575C(4)
was not a criminal offence and it is noteworthy, as has been indicated, that
the new Code omits all reference to such ""a charge"" and the relevant
sections do not purport to make provision for its trial but are carefully
restricted to the hearing and determination of an application to impose
sentence of preventive detention.

The fact that the 1947 statute, like that in force in
England, (Prevention of Crime Act, (1908), c. 59) provided for the
inclusion of the allegation of being an habitual criminal in the indictment
charging the substantive offence (s. 575C(2)) has a significant bearing on the
question of the time when notice was required to be given. It has been held
under the equivalent provisions of the English statute that

… when a prisoner is found guilty of the first charge, the
charge as to being a habitual criminal must be tried at the same sessions, and
cannot be postponed. You cannot split an indictment. …

(per Phillimore J. in The King v. George Jennings5).

It follows that as the substantive offence and the habitual
criminal charge were required to be disposed of at the same sessions, the seven
days' notice required under the old

[Page 518]

s. 575C(4)(b) was necessarily
referable to seven clear days before the trial of the indictment which
contained both allegations.

As was said by Mr. Justice Estey in Brusch v. The Queen,
supra, at p. 381:

What is more significant is that even in the indictment it
is sufficient ""to state that the offender is a habitual criminal""
(575C(2)) and this statement can be added only after ""not less than seven
days' notice"" (575C(4)(b)).

It can be seen, therefore, that whereas under the 1947
statute notice that the offender was to ""be tried on a charge of being a
habitual criminal"" had to be given seven days before the trial of the
substantive offence with which it was linked in the indictment, there is
nothing in the present Criminal Code  to preclude the notice of an
application for preventive detention being initiated as it was in the present
case by the giving of seven days' notice after conviction but before sentence,
although notice given seven days before the trial as heretofore would still be
valid as this would necessarily be seven days before the conviction and
therefore before the time of making the application.

In the case of Regina v. Stepanoff,
supra, both the trial judge and the judges of appeal appear to have placed
reliance on the decision of this Court in Parkes v. Regina6, as
holding that the preventive detention application contemplated by s. 660  must
be heard ""immediately after conviction of the substantive offence"".

In the course of his decision, Lazure J. says:

From the various reasons for judgment given in the Parkes case, it is evident that this notice must be given at
least seven days before the trial of the accused and that immediately after the
verdict, the Crown must request the judge to defer sentence and forthwith hear
the evidence supporting the allegations contained in the notice.

With all respect, I am unable to find support for such a
contention in the reasons of this Court in Parkes v.
The Queen, supra, and I can only think that the learned judge fell into the
error of attributing the meaning of ""forthwith"" to the word
""immediately"" as used in that case.

[Page 519]

In the course of his reasons in Parkes v.
The Queen, supra, Mr. Justice Rand traces the history of the use of the
word ""immediately"" in this connection and at p. 773 refers to the
meaning attributed to it by Branson J. in Rex v. Vale7, where he said at p. 356:

""Follow immediately"" means dealing with the case
without hearing the man's previous history and before sentencing him.

Parkes v. The Queen, supra, is
certainly authority for the proposition that statements concerning the
character or past life of an accused person are not to be interposed before the
court between the time of his conviction and the opening of the hearing on the
application to sentence him to preventive detention, but the fact that no such
step is to be taken between the entering of the conviction and the opening of
the hearing does not mean that the one must follow the other immediately in
point of time. It is true that in Parkes v. The Queen,
supra, this Court approved of the notice of application which in that case
was given before the trial of the substantive charge, but as Mr. Justice Doull
has said in the course of his reasons in the present case, ""… it does not
follow that a notice at any time that is seven clear days before the
'application' is not sufficient.""

In support of the contention that our criminal law requires
that an accused shall know before he makes his plea the exact consequences of
conviction of the offence with which he is charged, counsel for the appellant
cited the provisions of s. 572(1) of the present Criminal Code  which are
as follows:

Where an accused is convicted of an offence for which a
greater punishment may be imposed by reason of previous convictions, no greater
punishment shall be imposed upon him by reason thereof unless the prosecutor
satisfies the court that the accused, before making his plea, was notified that
a greater punishment would be sought by reason thereof.

In my view this section has no application to the
imposition of a sentence of preventive detention. There is no valid analogy
between the imposition of punishment ""by reason of previous
convictions"" and the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention; in
the former case ""previous convictions"" automatically expose the
offender to greater punishment, whereas in the latter the separate and distinct

[Page 520]

issue of whether or not he is n habitual criminal must be determined against him
before the sentence of preventive detention can be imposed.

With the greatest respect for the views expressed by the
courts of the Province of Quebec in the case of Regina v.
Stepanoff, supra, I share the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Doull that
the notice of an application for imposition of a sentence of preventive
detention may be given at any time that allows seven clear days before the
application and is also before the day of sentence on the substantive offence.
There can, accordingly, be no valid objection to the notice given in the
present case.

It was, however, strongly contended before this Court that
this appeal should be allowed on the ground that the evidence leading to the
conviction on the substantive offence should not have been taken into
consideration by the learned trial judge in making his determination under s.
660 of the Code. This contention was supported on the ground that the
conviction for the substantive offence was not set out in the notice of
application as one of the ""previous convictions and other circumstances
upon which it is intended to found the application"" which are required to
be specified in such notice under the terms of s. 662(1) (a)(ii). It is
to be remembered, however, that an accused must have been convicted of the
substantive offence before the Court can hear the application to which the
notice relates (see s. 660(1)). Such conviction is, therefore, not one of ""the
previous convictions"" referred to in s. 662(1)  (a) (ii) but
the conviction upon which the jurisdiction of the Court to hear the
application is founded. The object of the notice is to prevent the accused from
being taken by surprise as to the circumstances upon which the prosecution
intends to rely, but as the statute itself makes consideration of the
substantive conviction a prerequisite to the hearing of the application, the
Court is also entitled to treat it as a material circumstance in reaching its
conclusion on the merits of the application whether such conviction is
specifically mentioned in the notice or not.

In the present case, however, the conviction of the
substantive offence was recited in the first paragraph of the notice in the
following terms:

TAKE NOTICE that, whereas you have been convicted for that you
did at or near Musquodoboit Harbour in the County of Halifax on or about

[Page 521]

the 6th day of December, A.D. 1959, unlawfully break and
enter the store of H. G. Guild Limited, situate at
Musquodoboit Harbour and did then therein commit the indictable offence of
theft contrary to Section 292  of the Criminal Code .

There can be no doubt that the learned trial judge was fully
justified in considering the conviction for the substantive offence and the
circumstances surrounding it in light of the appellant's past record in
reaching his conclusion.

Although the evidence taken at the trial for the substantive
offence was not before this Court, I accept Mr. Justice Currie's statement that
it shows

a system, a deliberate planning, a careful preliminary
examination of the premises where the safe was blown open at night and money
stolen therefrom.

As Mr. Justice Doull says, ""This was no crime on
the spur of the moment, but a carefully planned crime.""

Consideration must, of course, be given to the fact that the
appellant had not been convicted of any offence since his release from prison
in October 1957, that there is some evidence of his having made a little money
selling beer bottles and that the police evidence as to his criminal character
and reputation was largely based on past experience, but these circumstances
which were primarily for the consideration of the learned trial judge are not
sufficient in my view to counteract the effect of the substantive crime which
was not only carefully planned but was similar in nature to four other crimes
for which the appellant had been previously convicted.

In the case of Kirkland v. The Queen8, the accused had been out
of prison for six months before the commission of the substantive offence, the
circumstances of which were consistent with the view that he yielded to a
sudden temptation, and in the course of his decision allowing the appeal from a
sentence of preventive detention Mr. Justice Cartwright said:

It was argued on behalf of the respondent that the
appellant's criminal record coupled with the conviction of the substantive
offence formed a sufficient basis for the finding that he was an habitual
criminal. As to this I agree with the view expressed by Lord Reading L.C.J.
giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Jones (1920)
15 Cr. App. R. 20 at 21:

""The legislature never
intended that a man should be convicted of being a habitual criminal merely
because he had a number of previous convictions against him.""

[Page 522]

There have however been cases in which the Court of Criminal
Appeal has upheld a finding that a prisoner was an habitual criminal on the
ground that the nature of the substantive offence viewed in the light of his
previous record was in itself evidence that he was leading persistently a
criminal life.

In my view the present case comes within the latter category
and the evidence of the appellant selling beer bottles and perhaps doing other
odd jobs between convictions is subject to the consideration referred to by
Darling J. (as he then was) in Rex v. George Jennings, supra, at p. 122,
when he said:

If a man occupies a day or two of his time in doing work,
that does not prevent him from being a habitual criminal. The word
""habitual"" is used in other collocations than in the phrase
""habitual criminal"". For instance, it is applied to drunkards, but a
habitual drunkard does not mean a person who is never sober. Drunkenness is not
continuous, nor are the acts of committing crimes.

I am accordingly of opinion that the finding and the
sentence imposed by Chief Justice Ilsley should not be disturbed on this
ground.

It was also contended on behalf of the appellant that evidence
of a conviction which had not been specified in the notice of application and
which had occurred before the appellant was eighteen years of age was wrongly
admitted together with evidence of an acquittal.

Apparently these items were inadvertently not deleted when
the appellant's record was put in evidence but no objection was taken to their
admissibility, and I agree with Currie J. that

It is seriously to be doubted if the learned Chief Justice
did more than glance at the matters to which objection is now taken. It is
inconceivable that such an experienced judge would be influenced or prejudiced
against the accused to even the slightest extent even if he did look at them.

I would dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—Drunkenness—Capacity to
form intent—Admission of doctor’s evidence—Instructions to jury—Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 61, s. 201 (a)(i) and (ii).

The accused was convicted of murder. He did
not deny the killing, and he gave to the police a statement the admissibility
of which was affirmed in the Courts below and is now unchallenged. After
drinking heavily in a hotel until closing time, the accused met a woman who
asked him to take her out in his car. While in the car she made sexual advances
to him. After driving through various streets, he drove into a service station
parking area. He then stabbed her with a knife, some fifteen times, pushed her
out of the car and drove off.

A psychiatrist was called by the Crown to
give expert evidence on hypothetical questions in which were substantially
included the material facts related in the accused’s statement. He expressed
the opinion that any one, able to do what the accused was alleged to have done,
would have the capacity to form the intent to murder. The defence was accused’s
lack of capacity, on account of drunkenness, to form the intent to commit
murder either under s. 201(a) (i) or s. 201(a) (ii) of the Code.

The conviction was affirmed by a majority
judgment of the Court of Appeal, the dissent being in respect of the
admissibility of the psychiatrist’s evidence. The accused appealed to this
Court (1) on questions of law as to which there was a dissent in the Court
below and (2) on other questions of law by leave of this Court granted under s.
597(1) (b) of the Code.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The evidence of the psychiatrist had been
properly admitted.

The instructions given by the trial judge to
the jury as to the intent required under s. 201 (a) (ii) of the Code and
those he gave in answer to the questions put to him by a juror were in both
respects according to law.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], affirming the
accused’s conviction on a charge of murder. Appeal dismissed.

J.B. Pomerant, for the appellant.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.

[Page 536]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—At the conclusion of a jury trial presided
over by Thomson J., at Toronto, the appellant was convicted of the murder of
one Margaret “Peggy” Bennett, on or about the 10th of June, 1960, at the
municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.

His appeal from this conviction was dismissed by
a majority decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2].

Appellant then appealed to this Court (i) on
questions of law as to which there was a dissent in the Court below, as
provided under s. 597(1) (a), and (ii) on other questions of law by
leave of this Court granted under s. 597(1) (b).

The circumstances surrounding the commission of
the offence are described mainly in a statement made to the police by appellant
some ten days after the fatal occurrence. The admissibility of this statement
in evidence was affirmed in the two Courts below and is now unchallenged.

For the purposes of this appeal, this summary of
the facts is sufficient. At about 9 o’clock in the evening of the 9th of June, 1960, appellant, his wife,
Douglas Zachariah and Hubert Vincent Baker went to the Wembley Hotel on Danforth Avenue, in Toronto. Shortly after they arrived, Mrs.
Fisher returned home and the men, who had consumed beer in her company in the
Ladies’ Beverage Room, moved to the Men’s Beverage Room where they drank beer
and remained up to closing time, shortly after midnight The material events
that took place thereafter are related with minute details in appellant’s
statement. Upon leaving the hotel, he met Peggy Bennett, whom he knew by sight
as a patron of the hotel beverage room, and was asked if he had his car. He
told her to wait while he went home to get it. He came back with the car and,
upon her suggestion that they go to a restaurant to have some coffee, declared
that he did not have any money. As they drove away, she asked him for a
cigarette and he stopped at a restaurant where he knew he could get some and
pay the next day. He thus obtained a package of Black Cat filter tips. They sat
in the car outside the restaurant, smoking, and she commenced “fondling” him.
He drove off again and she continued the fondling. He then indicated the
various streets on which he travelled, with particulars as to traffic lights
and signs.

[Page 537]

Finally, he told her that if she wanted to get
it, she was going to get it, and wheeled into a service station parking area.
There, with a knife, which he carried in his car, he stabbed her—some fifteen
times, according to the evidence. of the pathologist who performed the
autopsy—pushed her out of the car and drove off. On his way home, he threw away
one of her shoes and part of the contents of her purse.

Towards the end of his statement, he said, with
respect to the actual time of the fatal stabbing:

I really went off my rocker, I guess, or I
must have been drunk, or a combination of both.

At trial, both Zachariah and Baker gave evidence
as part of the case for the Crown and were then cross-examined by defence
counsel as to the quantity of beer consumed by appellant at the hotel.
According to Zachariah, appellant had four glasses of beer with him, but in the
course of the evening visited other tables where, he assumes, appellant also
drank. Baker declared that appellant had, that night, a “considerable quantity”
of beer.

Before closing the case for the prosecution, the
Crown called Dr. Norman Lewis Easton, Director of Psychiatry at the Ontario
Hospital, New Toronto, and a practitioner of long standing in that particular
branch of medical treatment. Having read appellant’s statement and being asked
an hypothetical question, in which were substantially included the material
facts related in the statement, he expressed the opinion that any one, able to
do what appellant was alleged to have done, would have the capacity to form the
intent to murder, even if he had consumed twenty-five glasses of beer or more.
Appellant, testifying subsequently in his own defence, swore that he had drunk,
on that occasion, about twenty-five glasses of beer and that he had no
recollection of what took place after he left the hotel.

That appellant killed Mrs. Bennett by the
infliction, with a knife, of numerous kinds of wounds, including the
perforation of the aorta, is not in issue. The defence was appellant’s lack of
capacity, on account of drunkenness, to form the intent to commit murder either
under s. 201 (a) (i) or s. 201(a) (ii).

The dissent in the Court of Appeal is with
respect to the admissibility of the evidence given by Dr. Easton. In the view
of the minority, that evidence was inadmissible on

[Page 538]

grounds related to the qualifications of Dr.
Easton, the nature of the opinion he gave, the form of the questions put to him
to elicit that opinion, the facts he took into consideration to form it and the
manner in which he expressed it. It is particularly emphasized that by giving
that opinion, which, it is said, required no scientific knowledge or training
and which any layman was in as good a position to form, Dr. Easton usurped the
function of the jury. If admissible at all, it is added, it was at least
inadmissible as part of the case for the prosecution when, at that stage of the
trial, the issue of drunkenness as affecting the capacity to form an intent,
had not been raised. The Judges of the majority considered that the Crown had
to prove beyond doubt, as an essential element of its case, the intent required
to constitute the offence of murder; that the issue of drunkenness had been
raised in the cross-examination of Zachariah and Baker by counsel for the
defence and in the appellant’s statement; that Dr. Easton was qualified and in
a better position than a layman to form an opinion in the matter and that there
was no fault in the manner in which this opinion was elicited by the Crown or
formed and expressed by the expert. They concluded that the evidence had been
properly admitted.

With deference to the views of the learned
Judges who dissented in the Court below, we are all in substantial agreement
with the reasons expressed by Aylesworth J.A., who spoke for the majority, and
concur in the conclusion which he reached.

The grounds upon which leave to appeal was
granted are related (i) to the directions given by the trial Judge as to the
intent required under s. 201 (a) (ii) and to those he gave in answer to
the questions put to him by a juror. After carefully considering the
submissions made at the hearing by counsel for appellant, in his full and able
argument, we are all satisfied that the instructions given, in both respects,
were according to law.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OP APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Juvenile delinquents—Whether notice of
hearing served on parents—Conviction made in absence of parents—Certiorari—Lack
of jurisdiction—Leave to appeal granted by Supreme Court of Canada— Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 141, 414, 705, 708(1)—The
Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160, s.
10(1)—The Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, s. 41.

The appellant, a boy aged 14, was declared by a judge of the
Winnipeg Juvenile Court to be a juvenile delinquent. He moved before a judge of
the Court of Queen's Bench for an order quashing the conviction without the
actual issue of a writ of certiorari on the ground, inter alia, that his
parents had not been properly served with a notice of hearing of the charge.
His application was dismissed, and this judgment was affirmed by a majority in
the Court of Appeal. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court subject to
argument as to the right to grant leave.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the finding of delinquency
quashed.

Per Kerwin C.J. and Judson J.: This Court had power to
grant leave to appeal under s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act. Section
41(3) of the Act had no application as the judgment appealed from was not one
affirming a conviction.

Section 10(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, which
requires that written notice of the hearing of any charge of delinquency shall
be served on the parent or parents of the child concerned, had not been
complied with. The letter written to the father by the probation officer was
not compliance with the section and the mere fact that thereafter the father
was advised verbally of the nature of the charge did not mend matters.
Furthermore, the father was not afforded the right to be present at the hearing
as mentioned in s. 10(1). It was no answer to say that the granting of a writ
of certiorari was a matter of discretion. No such question could arise where
the terms of a statute had not been complied with.

Per Locke and Martland JJ.: Compliance with s. 10 of
the Juvenile Delinquents Act is a condition precedent to the Juvenile
Court judge acquiring jurisdiction, and it was shown in this case that the
section had not been complied with. Furthermore, the record disclosed a failure
to comply with the imperative provisions of s. 708(1)  of the Criminal Code ,
which requires that the substance of the information shall be stated to the
accused and that he shall be asked whether he pleads guilty or not guilty.
Sections 17 and 38 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act do not relieve the
judges of the Juvenile Court from complying with s. 708(1) of the Code.

[Page 639]

Per Cartwright J.: Service on the parent or parents of
the appellant of notice of hearing was an essential preliminary, in the absence
of which the judge of the Juvenile Court acted without jurisdiction.
Furthermore, there was neither arraignment nor plea in this case. This was
clearly a case in which the writ of certiorari should be granted.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba1, affirming a decision of Campbell J.
Appeal allowed.

J. L. Crawford, for the appellant.

G. E. Pilkey, for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Judson J. was delivered by

The Chief Justice:—On
September 23, 1957, the appellant Gerald Smith, then fourteen years of age, was
declared by the judge of the Winnipeg Juvenile Court and Family Court to be a
delinquent and was fined $10. An application that the finding of a delinquency
against the child be quashed without the actual issue of a writ of certiorari
was dismissed by Campbell J. on December 23, 1957, and an appeal from his
decision was dismissed May 16, 1958, by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba2,
Adamson C.J., Coyne and Montague JJ., the Chief Justice dissenting. On June 26,
1958, we granted Gerald leave to appeal to this Court on all points mentioned
in his notice of motion subject to argument as to our right to grant leave. The
appeal did not come on for argument until March 4, 1959.

For a proper appreciation of the questions involved it is
necessary to set forth the attending circumstances in some detail. On August
15, 1957, the information and complaint by Julius Chmielewski, probation
officer of the Winnipeg Juvenile Court and Family Court was taken ""that
Gerald Smith, a child, did on or about the 7th day of June, 1957, at the City
of Winnipeg, in the said Province, commit a delinquency in that he did
unlawfully and indecently assault Helen Balaban, a female, contrary to the form
of the statute in such case made and provided"". 

According to the affidavit of the probation officer
filed on the application to Campbell J., he attempted unsuccessfully from
August 16 to August 27, 1957, to get in touch by tele-

[Page 640]

phone with Gerald's parents or either of them at their
home in Winnipeg and on August 27 sent a letter by post to Matthew Smith, the
child's father, addressed to him at his home, reading as follows:

Dear Mr. Smith:— Re: Your son Gerald

This is to advise you that you must be present with your son
for a court hearing on Friday, August 30th, at 10 o'clock in the morning.

On August 29, 1957, the father admitted to the officer
having received the letter but indicated that he could not be present with
Gerald at Court on August 30 as he was leaving Winnipeg on a business trip. The
officer informed the father that his son and four other juveniles were charged
in regard to an indecent assault upon a little girl in a shack behind the
father's home. The father indicated that this was nothing serious but rather a
boyish prank. He requested that the matter be remanded for two weeks to Friday,
September 13, 1957, and the matter was so arranged.

According to the same affidavit, the father telephoned the
officer on September 12 requesting a further remand to Monday, September 16, on
the ground that he would be out of the city for the weekend. The officer
intimated that the mother could bring the child to Court but the father
indicated that his wife knew nothing of the matter and he did not want her to
become involved, but he assured the officer that he would be present at Court
with Gerald and that he would not require any further remand. On September 16
neither the father nor child appeared in Court and a warrant was issued for the
apprehension of the child. On September 20 he was arrested without the
knowledge of his parents and was brought before the judge of the Winnipeg
Juvenile Court and Family Court, and was remanded in custody to September 24.
Later in the day, on September 20, the mother attended at the office of the
probation officer and was informed by him of the circumstances of the
delinquency alleged against Gerald.

Three other juveniles were apprehended in connection with
the same delinquency and appeared in Court on July 8 and the final disposition
of the matter so far as they were concerned was completed July 16. On August
30, a fourth boy attended Court with his mother, on which date the matter of
that charge was completed.

[Page 641]

The transcript of what occurred in Court on Friday,
September 20, is as follows:

Judge: Gerald,
how old are you?

Gerald: 14.

Judge: 14.
When is your birthday?

Gerald: March
2nd.

Judge: You didn't
show up when you were supposed to show up so we issued a warrant. Why weren't
you here?

Gerald: I
didn't know.

Mr. Chmielewski: His
father was doing all the arranging Your Honor, the boy was away all summer on
the farm. The father was in touch with me three times and asked to remand the
case and remand the case and then he forgot to make any arrangements. He asked
me to remand the case definitely for Monday, he's going to be here, and he didn't
even bother to phone and tell me about it. I think he's just giving us the
run-around, so as a result a warrant was issued for this boy. It's unfortunate,
but the boy didn't know what arrangements were made to be here or not. The
father was carrying out all the arrangements.

Judge: That's
all very well but this lad was in here and he's charged with a pretty serious
offence.

Mr. Chmielewski: No. Your
Honor he wasn't here. He was charged but he was not here.

Judge: Oh I
see. There's an Information here sonny that on or about the 7th of June, a long
time ago, unlawfully and indecently assault Helen Balaban. What about that is
that correct or not? What did you do?

Gerald: We
took her pants down and let her go.

Judge: Is this
one of the boys that had that Club?

Mr. Chmielewski: Yes,
this happened to be in his own yard.

Judge: Well
the father is not here again this morning?

Mr. Chmielewski :
There's nobody here. I didn't know anything about this family … is your mother
sick? (To Gerald)

Gerald: I
don't know whether she is.

Mr. Chmielewski: Doesn't
she live at home?

Gerald : She's
at home.

Judge: Well
we'll remand this to September 24th, that's Tuesday, at 10 o'clock. Okay.

Mr. Chmielewski: In
custody?

Judge: Yes.

COURT ADJOURNED.

What may be taken to be a return to a writ of certiorari, if
it had been granted, appears on the back of the information and complaint where
the judge indicated that on September 23 ""Case brought forward to this
date at request of Mr. Chmielewski. Delinquent. Fine $10.00"". It was on
that date that counsel appeared for the first time and requested an adjournment
as there had not been sufficient

[Page 642]

time for him to be properly instructed. He stated that, on
the facts as he understood them, he would advise the boy to plead not guilty.
The adjournment was refused, the judge taking the position that the boy had
already admitted the delinquency. All this time the father was kept outside the
room in which the hearing was taking place and it was only then that the judge
directed that he be brought in. During the discussion which ensued between the
judge and the father the latter said that there had been a misunderstanding as
to the date to which the hearing was to be finally adjourned. Considering that
there had been a plea of guilty by the child the magistrate imposed a fine of
$10.

This Court had power to grant leave to appeal under subs.
(1) of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259:

41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the
Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the
highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which
judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme
Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by
any other court.

Subsection (3) reads:

41. (3) No appeal to the Supeme Court lies under this
section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting
aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or,
except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other
than an indictable offence.

It has no application as the judgment of the Court of
Appeal is not one affirming a conviction.

In connection with the first ground of appeal ""that the
Juvenile Court Judge has no jurisdiction"" no reference was made on the
argument before us to s. 414  of the Criminal Code  which reads in part:

414. Subject to this Act, every superior court of criminal
jurisdiction and every court of criminal jurisdiction that has power to try an
indictable offence is competent to try an accused for that offence

(a) if the accused is found, is arrested or is in custody
within the territorial jurisdiction of the court ;

As pointed out by the Chief Justice of Manitoba, we
must take judicial notice of the Order-in-Council appointing Emerson J. Heaney,
Esquire, a Juvenile Court Judge. He was appointed by the
Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council of

[Page 643]

Manitoba under the authority of subs. (1) of s. 6 of The
Child Welfare Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 35, whereby the
Lieu-tenant-Governor-in-Council may establish Courts for the purpose of dealing
with juvenile delinquents under The Juvenile Deliquents Act and define
their respective territorial jurisdictions. It was, therefore, a Court duly
established under a provincial statute for the purpose of dealing with juvenile
delinquents in accordance with what is now s. 2(1) (b) of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160. Subsection (1) of s. 5 thereof
provides that prosecutions and trials under the Act shall be summary and shall mutatis
mutandis be governed by the provisions of the Criminal Code  relating to
summary convictions in so far as such provisions are applicable. Part XXIV of
the Criminal Code  relates to summary convictions and included therein is
s. 705 :

705. Every summary conviction court has jurisdiction to try,
determine and adjudge proceedings to which this Part applies in the territorial
division over which the person who constitutes that court has jurisdiction.

However, it has been held by the Court of Appeal for
Ontario in Rex v. Abbott,3 that s. 577 of the old Criminal Code 
which, for present purposes, is in the same terms as s. 414 of the new
Code, applied where, although the offence charged had been committed outside
the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of a Court, the accused was in
custody within those limits. Leave to appeal from that decision was refused4
on two grounds, one of which was that it was not in conflict with a prior
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in The King v. O'Gorman5.

In view of the fact that no argument was adduced with
reference to s. 414 of the Code, I say nothing about the first ground of appeal
but proceed to a consideration of another objection urged on behalf of the
appellant; that is that, as required by subs. (1) of s. 10 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, due notice of the hearing of the charge of delinquency was
not served on either parent. That subsection reads as follows:

10. (1) Due notice of the hearing of any charge of delinquency
shall be served on the parent or parents or the guardian of the child, or if
there be neither parent or guardian, or if the residence of the parent or
parents

[Page 644]

or guardian be unknown, then on some near relative living in
the city, town or county, if any there be, whose whereabouts is known, and any
person so served has the right to be present at the hearing.

The letter of August 27, 1957, is certainly not a
compliance with this section and the mere fact that thereafter the father was
advised verbally of the nature of the charge does not mend matters. On this
ground the appeal should be allowed and in this connection it might be pointed
out that the father was not afforded the right to be present at the hearing as
mentioned in the latter part of the subsection. I quite agree with the Chief
Justice of Manitoba that prior thereto the father was most neglectful but that
cannot cure the defect. Nor is it any answer to say that the granting of a writ
of certiorari is a matter of discretion. No such question can arise where the
terms of a statute have not been complied with.

While it appears to be clear that the Juvenile Court judge
was bearing in mind what had been said when the other children were before him,
it is preferable to pass no judgment on the other points raised on behalf of
the appellant.

The appeal should be allowed and the orders of the Court of
Appeal and of Campbell J. set aside. In view of the fact that the appellant was
in custody from September 20 to September 23 and of the long time that has
elapsed since then, there should not be a new trial, but the finding of
deliquency should be quashed. In fact, counsel for the Crown agreed that, if
the Court came to the conclusion that the finding could not stand, there should
not be a new trial.

The judgment of Locke and Martland JJ. was delivered by

Locke J.:—The
appellant, Gerald Smith, then a boy of fourteen years, was on August 15, 1957,
charged in an information laid by a probation officer under the provisions of
the Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160, that he:

did on or about the 7th day of June, A.D. 1957 at the City
of Winnipeg in the said province commit a delinquency in that he did unlawfully
and indecently assault Helen Balaban, a female, contrary to the form of the statute
in such case made and provided.

[Page 645]

The offence of indecent assault is indictable and one guilty
of the offence is liable to imprisonment for five years and to be whipped,
under the provisions of s. 141(1)  of the Criminal Code .

The evidence does not disclose that the fact of the
information having been laid was communicated directly to the boy but, in an
affidavit made by the probation officer which was filed in the proceedings
taken before Campbell J. hereinafter referred to, that official stated that he
made several attempts to communicate with the parents of the boy and, these
failing, he wrote a letter on August 27, 1957, to the boy's father, Matthew
Smith, addressed to his home in Winnipeg, saying:

This is to advise you that you must be present with your son
for a court hearing on Friday, August 30th, at 10 o'clock in the morning.

This notice appears to have been given in purported
compliance with s. 10 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act which, so far as
it need be considered, reads:

Due notice of the hearing of any charge of delinquency shall
be served on the parent or parents or the guardian of the child.

On August 29, Matthew Smith came to the office of the
probation officer in Winnipeg, and, according to the latter, admitted that he
had received the letter and asked that the hearing be adjourned from August 30
for two weeks. The officer agreed to this and swears that at this time he
informed the father that his son and four other juveniles were charged with an
indecent assault upon a little girl. He further states that on September 12
Matthew Smith telephoned to him asking for a further adjournment from September
13 to September 16, assuring the probation officer that he would be present at
that time with the boy. This adjournment was made but on September 16 neither
the boy nor his father appeared.

On that date a warrant was issued for the arrest of the boy.
The material does not disclose the date of the arrest but on September 20 the
boy was in custody and was brought before the judge of the Juvenile Court and a
transcript of what took place at this time forms part of the record. When the
boy was asked by the judge why he had not appeared on the previous occasion,
his answer was that

[Page 646]

he did not know about the matter and the probation officer
explained to the Court that all the arrangements had been made with the father.
There is no suggestion that any notice of what was apparently intended as a
hearing of the charge and which was then held was given to either of the boy's
parents or that either of them knew anything about it until after the event.

As the record discloses, the information was not read to the
boy, the judge contenting himself with saying to him that there was an
information saying that on or about the 7th of June he had unlawfully and
indecently assaulted Helen Balaban, and then asked:

What about that? Is that correct or not. What did you do?

To this the boy replied:

We took her pants down and let her go.

This answer appears to have been interpreted by the
judge as a plea of guilty. No other evidence was given. It appears from the
affidavit filed by the probation officer that three other boys had been
apprehended, charged with the same offence, and these charges had been disposed
of on July 16, more than two months previous. A fourth boy also involved, it
was stated, had appeared on August 30, 1957, in the Court when the matter was
dealt with. There was no evidence given as to where the alleged offence had
been committed but the probation officer told the judge that Gerald Smith was
one of the boys that had a club, meaning, apparently, a boys' club, and that
the occurrence had taken place in the back yard of his father's property.

At the conclusion of these proceedings on September 20, the
judge did not announce his decision but remanded the boy to custody until
September 24. On September 23, Mr. J. L. Crawford, a barrister practising in
Winnipeg, appeared on the instructions of the father before the judge of the
Juvenile Court and asked that the matter be reopened and the boy permitted to
withdraw what had apparently been regarded as his plea to the charge. The judge
declined to permit this and announced that he was going to fine the boy $10 and
this was paid. The information which had been

[Page 647]

laid and which was endorsed with the record of the various
remands so-called bears an endorsement reading: ""Delinquent, fine
$10.""

Section 5 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act provides
that, except as otherwise provided in the Act, prosecutions and trials shall be
summary and shall be governed by the provisions of the Criminal Code  relating
to summary convictions in so far as such provisions are applicable, whether or
not the act constituting the offence charged would be, in the case of an adult,
triable summarily, with certain exceptions which do not affect the present
matter.

Section 708(1)  of the Criminal Code  provides in part
that, where the defendant appears before a summary conviction Court, the
substance of the information shall be stated to him and he shall be asked
whether he pleads guilty or not guilty to the information where the proceedings
are in respect of an offence that is punishable on summary conviction, a
provision which is rendered applicable by the terms of s. 5  above mentioned.

Section 37 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act provides
for an appeal from any decision of a juvenile Court by leave of a judge of the
Court of Queen's Bench, an appeal which, if granted, is heard by a judge of
that Court. The appellant in the present matter did not apply for leave but
moved before Campbell J. for an order quashing the conviction without the
actual issue of a writ of certiorari.

In the reasons for judgment delivered by that learned judge
he said in part:

I find that there was more than adequate notice to the
father of the hearing of this charge. Section 10 of the Juvenile Delinquents
Act 1929 has been adequately complied with.

He further was of the opinion that a plea had been
properly taken, that the nature of the charge had been explained in the proper
manner by the Juvenile Court judge and that there had been no denial of
justice. It is, in my opinion, unnecessary to consider the portion of the
reasons delivered by the learned judge dealing with what was said to be the
refusal of the Juvenile Court judge to hear counsel on behalf of the boy and
his refusal to permit what was considered to be the plea of guilty to be
withdrawn.

[Page 648]

The opinion of the majority of the
learned judges of the Court of Appeal6 was delivered by Coyne J.A. who
considered that sufficient information had been given to the boy as to the
nature of the charge and that he had fully understood it, that the evidence
showed that full information as to the charge was conveyed to the father on
August 29 and that Campbell J. had in refusing to direct that a writ of certiorari
be issued and the conviction quashed properly exercised his discretion.
Adamson C.J.M., who dissented, would have directed that a writ of certiorari be
issued and the conviction quashed upon the grounds, inter alia, that s. 10 of
the Juvenile Delinquents Act had not been complied with and that,
accordingly, the Juvenile Court judge had not acquired jurisdiction to hear the
charge and that there had been no arraignment and plea taken as required by s.
708(1) of the Code.

As provided by s. 17 of the Summary Convictions Act, R.S.M.
1954, c. 24, the evidence taken in this matter is to be treated as part of the
conviction or order in any proceedings other than an appeal to the County Court
to quash the conviction, whether by certiorari or otherwise. I agree with the
learned Chief Justice of Manitoba that it was shown that s. 10 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act had not been complied with. The language of the section is
imperative :

Due notice of the hearing of any charge of delinquency shall
be served on the parent, or parents.

The letter written to the father by the probation
officer on August 27 gave notice of a hearing on August 30, though the offence
with which the son was charged was not stated. While the father was informed of
the nature of the charge on August 29, the hearing referred to in the letter
did not take place, the matter being adjourned by arrangement until August 30,
and again by arrangement with the father until September 16 when neither the
father nor the son appeared. Accepting the statement made by the boy on
September 20, he knew nothing about the matter. There is no pretense that any
notice, either in writing as required by s. 10 or oral, was given to the father
or the mother of the hearing which took place after the boy was arrested on

[Page 649]

September 20, and it is upon the evidence that was
taken at that time that the finding that he was a delinquent was based.

Compliance with the section is, in my opinion, a condition
precedent to the Juvenile Court judge acquiring jurisdiction. The principle
applied by the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in Rex v. Howell7
applies.

I am further of the opinion, in agreement with the learned
Chief Justice, that the record discloses a failure to comply with the
imperative provisions of s. 708(1) of the Code. The offence with which this boy
was charged was that defined by s. 141  of the Criminal Code  but, by
virtue of s. 3 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, such an offence by a
child of the age of the appellant is to be known as a delinquency and dealt
with as provided in that Act. Section 708(1)  requires that the substance of the
information shall be stated to the accused and that he shall be asked whether
he pleads guilty or not guilty. There was, in my opinion, an insufficient
compliance with the first of these requirements. It is unlikely that a boy of
fourteen would understand what an ""information"" was or appreciate the
gravity of the offence defined by the Criminal Code  with which he was
charged. These are matters that should have been explained to him before he was
permitted to plead. As to the second requirement, he was not asked whether he
pleaded guilty or not guilty to the information. On the contrary, the boy was
told that there was an information that some three months previously he had unlawfully
and indecently assaulted Helen Balaban and the questions then put to him which
are quoted above were simply an invitation to him to make a statement of what
had occurred. The boy had been deprived of the protection the presence of his
father would have afforded by the failure to comply with s. 10  and should not
have been permitted by the judge to make a statement without at least being
warned that he was not obliged to say anything. The failure of the Juvenile
Court judge to discharge what was his clear duty in this respect to the boy
appearing before him without counsel does not go to the question of
jurisdiction, but the

[Page 650]

failure to comply with the plain provisions of s. 708(1) 
does. The principle applied in Howell's case is also applicable in these
circumstances, in my opinion.

The contention that s. 17 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act
which provides that the trial may be as informal as the circumstances will
permit, consistently with a due regard for a proper administration of justice, and
of s. 38 that a juvenile delinquent shall be treated not as a criminal but as a
misdirected or misguided child, in some way relieves the judges of that court
from complying with s. 708(1) of the Code, cannot be supported. I can see no
difficulty in complying with ss. 17 and 38 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act while
following the requirements of that section.

As upon these grounds it is my opinion that the conviction
cannot stand, I express no opinion upon the other objections raised to the
proceedings in the present matter.

I would allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the
Court of Appeal and the order of Campbell J. and direct that the finding of
delinquency be quashed.

Cartwright J.:—The
relevant facts are stated in the reasons of the Chief Justice and those of my
brother Locke which I have had the advantage of reading.

I agree with their conclusion that service on the parent or
parents of the appellant of notice of the hearing held on September 20, 1957,
as imperatively required by s. 10(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, was
an essential preliminary, in the absence of which the learned judge of the
Juvenile Court acted without jurisdiction. It was on that date that the learned
judge took from the appellant what he regarded as a plea of guilty. The
supposed plea was the only foundation for the finding of delinquency.

The finding that the learned judge was, for the reason just
mentioned, without jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing is sufficient to
dispose of this appeal, but I am also of opinion that there was neither
arraignment nor plea. If the learned judge had said to the appellant,

There's an information here sonny that on or about the 7th
of June, a long time ago, unlawfully and indecently assault Helen Balaban. What
about that is that correct or not?

[Page 651]

It might have been arguable that this was a sufficient
compliance with the provisions of s. 708(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code , but
the addition of the words,—""What did you do?"" —transformed what might
have been regarded as a question as to whether the appellant pleaded guilty or
not guilty into an invitation to him to make a statement as to what had
occurred.

As to the suggestion that the writ of certiorari should be
refused in this case as a matter of discretion, in my opinion the rule by which
the Court should be guided is accurately stated in the following passage in
Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 11, p. 140:

Although the order is not of course it will though
discretionary nevertheless be granted ex debito justitiae, to quash proceedings
which the Court has power to quash, where it is shown that the Court below has
acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, if the application is
made by an aggrieved party and not merely by one of the public and if the conduct
of the party applying has not been such as to disentitle him to relief; …

In my opinion, this is clearly a case in which the writ
should be granted.

I do not find it necessary to express an opinion on any of
the other matters argued before us.

I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by the Chief
Justice.

Appeal allowed and finding of delinquency

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL.

Criminal law—Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada—Extension of time—""Special reasons""—The Criminal Code , 1953–54
(Can.), c. 51, s. 597 (l)(b), as re-enacted by 1956, c. 48, s. 19 .

Where it has not been shown that ""special reasons""
exist to extend the time within which leave to appeal to this Court may be
obtained under s. 597(1)  (b) of the Criminal Code , as re-enacted
in 1956, such extension will not be granted.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from a judgment of the
Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1. Application refused.

L. Corriveau, for the appellant, applicant.

M. H. Franklin, Q.C., for the respondent.

The Court:—We
all agree that this application should be dismissed, and one of the reasons
that justifies our refusal is that it is unreasonably tardy.

Under the Criminal Code  (s. 597 ), a person convicted
of an indictable offence, whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal,
may appeal to this Court if leave is granted within twenty-one days after the
judgment appealed from is pronounced. This Court, however, may for special
reasons extend the time. Here, the judgment was pronounced by the Court of
Queen's Bench on January 9, 1961, and the notice of motion asking for leave to
appeal was filed only on the 9th of March.

The delay of twenty-one days is imperative unless, for
special reasons, this Court extends such time. Beaver v. The Queen1.
It has not been shown to us that any special reasons exist in the present
instance.

The application should be refused.

Application refused. Attorney for the applicant:

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Wilful obstruction of lawful
use of property—Statements of accused made voluntarily—Jury properly instructed
as to “wilfully” to prove specific intent—Sufficient evidence for jury to
convict.

[Page 661]

The accused drove his motor car onto a
railway right-of-way and left it on the tracks where a train crashed into it.
Police officers found the accused at the home of one D and on being asked where
his car was he replied that it was parked on the railway track, that he did not
think trains travelled on that track, that he had taken the keys and turned off
the lights and that he had walked four miles for help. When told of the
collision he repeated the story but said the car was stuck rather than parked.
He could walk without assistance but staggered and appeared to be intoxicated.
He was indicted on two counts: (1) that he wilfully obstructed the lawful use
of property and (2) that he drove a motor vehicle while intoxicated. The jury
found the accused guilty on the first charge and not guilty on the second. His
appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. Leave to appeal was given by this
Court on certain questions of law.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

(1) The statements of the appellant were made
voluntarily; no threats or promises had been held out by the police officers.

(2) The trial judge instructed the jury
properly and adequately as to what was necessary for them to find that the
appellant wilfully obstructed the lawful use of property.

(3) There was evidence upon which the jury
could have convicted and the trial judge should not have directed the jury to
acquit.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
accused’s conviction on a charge of wilfully obstructing the lawful use of
property. Appeal dismissed.

C.R. Thomson, for the appellant.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—By leave of this Court Willis
McKenna appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his appeal against his
conviction after a trial before His Honour Judge Willmott and a jury. He had
been indicted on two counts: (1) that on or about the 10th day of February,
A.D. 1960, he did wilfully obstruct the lawful use of property, to wit: The
Canadian Pacific Railway right-of-way at Dixie Road; (2) that on or about the
10th day of February, A.D. 1960, while intoxicated he did drive motor vehicle
bearing Ontario licence number N4151,—both contrary to the Criminal Code . The
jury found the appellant guilty on the first charge and not guilty on the
second.

[Page 662]

Leave to appeal to this Court was given on the
following questions of law:

1. Did the Trial Judge err in admitting the
statements of the accused made to the police or to the Canadian Pacific Railway
investigating Officer?

2. Did the Trial Judge err in failing to
instruct the jury adequately as to “wilfully” and as to the burden of the Crown
to prove a specific intent?

3. Was there any evidence upon which the
jury could have convicted or should the Trial Judge have directed the jury to
acquit?

I have gone over the entire record and I adopt
as correct the following statement of facts contained in the respondent’s
factum. The evidence discloses that some time prior to 10.17 p.m. on the
evening of February 10, 1960, the appellant turned his motor car off the
travelled portion of the highway at a level crossing and proceded a short
distance along the railway tracks. At 10.17 p.m. a train crashed into the car
and carried it over a 1,000 foot-long bridge before coming to a stop. The engineer
saw no lights on the car before the impact. The motor had been shut off and the
keys were missing. At 10.30 p.m. the appellant called at the house of the witness Ogden, which was
about 1,000 yards away from the railway crossing, and asked him to call a taxi.
He left before the taxi came. Ogden described him as being drunk. At 11.45 p.m. two police officers,
Bodley and Cooper, found the appellant at the home of one Delany, two or three
doors from Ogden’s. They asked
where his car was and he replied that it was parked on the railway track, that
he did not think trains travelled on that track, that he had taken the keys and
turned off the lights and that he had walked four miles for help. He produced
the keys. When told of the collision he repeated the story but said the car was
stuck rather than parked. The appellant could walk without assistance but
staggered and appeared to be intoxicated. He was placed under arrest and taken
to Ogden’s house which he
identified as the place from which he had tried to make a telephone call. He
identified Ogden as the man to
whom he had spoken.

As to the first question of law it is necessary
to refer only to the evidence of the police officers, Bodley and Cooper.

[Page 663]

The County Court judge carefully considered
their testimony and the arguments presented by counsel and decided that
notwithstanding the evidence of drunkenness on the part of the appellant the
latter knew what he was saying. It is not a case where a trial judge considered
that the words used by an accused did not, because of his condition, amount to
his statement. After having admitted the statements in evidence the judge then
left it to the jury to assess what weight should be attached to them. I have no
doubt that the statements were made voluntarily and that no threats or promises
had been held out by the police officers.

As to the second question of law, after having
read and considered the charge of the trial judge several times, I have no
difficulty in concluding that he instructed the jury properly and adequately as
to what was necessary for them to find that the appellant wilfully obstructed
the lawful use of property.

Finally, as to the third question, there was
evidence upon which the jury could have convicted and the trial judge should
not have directed the jury to acquit. It was argued that the finding by the
jury that the appellant was not guilty of the second charge showed that the
jury were perverse in finding the appellant guilty on the first charge. It is
impossible to agree with this contention as quite likely the jury decided that
having found the appellant guilty on the first charge they would be merciful in
dealing with the second charge.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Summary conviction—Careless
driving—Whether grounds of appeal to County Court within requirements of s.
722(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code —The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1950, c.
379, s. 3—The Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.) c. 51, ss. 719 to 739.

The two accused were convicted of careless
driving contrary to s. 21(1) of The Highway Traffic Act. Both appealed
to the County Court on the grounds, inter alia, that (i) the magistrate
erroneously convicted the accused of the offence and (ii) the conviction was
contrary to law, the evidence and the weight of evidence. The County Court
dismissed the appeals on the preliminary objection that no proper grounds were
set out in the notice of appeal. The Court of Appeal gave no reasons for its
orders dismissing the appeals from these judgments. The accused were granted
leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeals should be allowed, and the cases remitted to the County Court judge to
be heard by way of trial de novo.

Per Kerwin
C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie
JJ.: The grounds set forth in the notice of appeal were sufficient to clothe
the County Court with jurisdiction to hear the appeals. Because the appeal
under Part XXIV for which provision is made by s. 727 is by way of trial de
novo, the grounds do not have to be stated with the same particularity as
those required in a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal in appeals from
trials of indictable offences. It is enough that such a notice evidences the
appellant’s sincerity of purpose in asserting his appeal for the reason that he
genuinely believes that he has been wrongly convicted and this excludes grounds
which are obviously irrelevant, frivolous or irreconciliable with the plea in
the Court below or with the other material before the Court. Under s. 727 the
appellant is not to be confined by being required to designate in advance the
specific issues to be raised at the second trial.

Per Fauteux
J.: The ground that the “conviction was contrary to law, the evidence and the
weight of evidence” met the requirements of s. 722(1)  (a) of the Criminal
Code .

[Page 609]

APPEALS from two judgments of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, dismissing
the appeals from two judgments of the County Court for the County of Peel. Appeals allowed.

S.J.G. Lane, for
the appellants.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau,
Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—By order of this Court dated January
24, 1961, leave to appeal was granted to these two appellants from two
judgments of the Court of Appeal of Ontario dismissing their appeals from the
County Court for the County of Peel whereby it was decided that the grounds of
appeal set forth in the appellants’ notices of appeal from their respective
convictions by different magistrates did not comply with the requirements of s.
722(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code . Leave was also granted to file a
single factum with respect to both appeals and the appeals were heard together.

Each of the appellants was convicted for
unlawfully driving his automobile carelessly contrary to s. 21(1) of The
Highway Traffic Act, and each appealed to the County Court of the County of Peel on
the same ground, namely:

(1) That the magistrate erroneously
convicted the appellant of the offence aforesaid;

(2) That the said conviction was contrary
to law, the evidence and the weight of evidence;

(3) Upon such other grounds as counsel may
be permitted to address the Court upon the hearing of the appeal.

In both cases preliminary objection was taken by
counsel for the respondent before the County Court that no proper grounds were
set out in the Notice of Appeal, and in dismissing the appeals for this reason
the County Court judge appears to have followed the decision of the Court of
Appeal of Ontario in the case of Regina v. Souter[1], as opposed to the decision of that
Court in Regina v. Kuusela[2]. After
referring to the fact that the Court of Appeal of Ontario had

[Page 610]

characterized the grounds of appeal set forth in
the Kuusela case, supra, as “the bare minimum”, the learned
County Court judge goes on to say:

The grounds set out in the case before me
fall far short of this bare minimum, in that it simply states that the
Magistrate erroneously convicted the Appellant of the offence. It does not
refer to any of his findings that would lead to such a conviction and it
provides little, if any, difference from the form of Notice set out in the
Souter or Gillespie cases, and upon this ground I must dismiss the Appeal.

This decision was rendered in the case of Jacobs,
but the Hipkin appeal was dismissed for the same reasons. The Court of Appeal
gave no reasons for its orders dismissing the appeals from these judgments.

The applications for leave to appeal in these
cases raise the following questions of law and jurisdiction:

(1) Was the Court of Appeal for Ontario right in holding that there were
not sufficient grounds set forth in the Notice of Appeal before His Honour,
Judge R. Stewart Clark, to comply with Section 722  of the Criminal Code ?

(2) Was the Court of Appeal for Ontario right in holding that His Honour,
Judge R. Stewart Clark, on appeal, had no jurisdiction to hear the said
appeal by way of trial de novo?

By virtue of the provisions of s. 3 of the Summary
Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 379, these are cases to which Part XXIV of
the Criminal Code  applies, and the appeals to the County Court judge
were, therefore, governed by ss. 719  to 739  of the Criminal Code .

The right of appeal from the magistrate to the
County Court is accorded by s. 720, the relevant portions of which are as
follows:

720. Except where otherwise provided by
law,

(a) the defendant in proceedings
under this Part may appeal to the appeal court

(i) from a conviction or order made against
him, or

(ii) against a sentence passed upon him;…

This right is limited only by the necessity of
complying with the provisions of s. 722  wherein the requisite notice of appeal
is described as:

722. (a)… a notice of appeal in writing
setting forth

(i) with reasonable certainty the
conviction or order appealed from or the sentence appealed against, and

(ii) the grounds of appeal;…

[Page 611]

As the setting forth of the grounds of appeal in
such a notice forms a part of the foundation upon which the jurisdiction of the
County Court rests, it follows that a notice which states no grounds at all
cannot form the basis of an appeal, but because the appeal under Part XXIV for
which provision is made by s. 727 is by way of trial de novo the grounds
do not have to be stated with the same particularity as those required in a
notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal in appeals from trials of indictable
offences.

In the vast majority of appeals from trials of
indictable offences the Court of Appeal is required to decide the issue before
it on the sole basis of the record of the proceedings at a trial which has been
concluded before the notice of appeal is prepared, whereas in appeals taken
pursuant to s. 727 the trial upon which the Appeal Court must base its decision
cannot commence until after the notice of appeal has been filed and served. It
follows that in the former cases the errors at the trial which are alleged as
grounds for the appeal must be specified in such manner as to inform the
respondent of the issues to be met in the Court of Appeal, but in the latter
case as the appeal is by way of a new hearing and the Appeal Court is not
concerned with specific errors in the conduct of the first trial, the notice of
appeal takes on an altogether different character. In my view it is enough that
such a notice evidences the appellant’s sincerity of purpose in asserting his
appeal for the reason that he genuinely believes that he has been wrongly
convicted and this requirement of necessity excludes notices of appeal in which
the grounds are obviously irrelevant, frivolous or irreconcilable with the plea
in the Court below or with the other material to be kept by the clerk of the
Appeal Court with the records of the Court in accordance with s. 726(1). See Regina v. Bamsey[3].

In conformity with this view, I am of opinion
that the grounds set forth in the present notices of appeal are sufficient to
clothe the County Court with jurisdiction to hear these appeals.

In the case of Regina v. Souter, supra, the
Court of Appeal of Ontario held that the allegation “that the conviction was contrary
to law, the evidence and the weight of evidence” was not a ground of appeal at
all within the

[Page 612]

meaning of s. 722  of the Criminal Code , and
in so doing followed the decision of the County Court judge for Victoria
County, British Columbia, in Regina v. Gillespie[4]. In the course of rendering the
decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[5],
Porter C.J.O. said of s. 722 :

I think that the section contemplated
that grounds sufficiently definite to indicate the issues to be raised on the
trial de novo should be set forth in the notice of appeal. Here there
were no such grounds given.

With the greatest respect, it seems to me to be
one of the characteristics of an appeal under s. 727 that many “issues to be
raised on the trial de novo” must arise as the evidence develops in the
course of that trial and that the appellant is not to be confined by being
required to designate in advance the specific issues to be raised at the second
trial.

In the case of Regina v. Kuusela, supra, which was decided by
the Court of Appeal of Ontario
after Regina v.
Souter, supra, that Court held that the appellant
had stated grounds which were “sufficient within the meaning of the statute”
when he alleged that:

The learned magistrate erred on the facts
and law in finding that the said William Kuusela drove his motor vehicle while
his ability to drive the same was impaired by the use of alcohol.

In the course of rendering the decision of the
Court of Appeal in this case, Porter C.J.O. said at[6]:

It may be that if it were intended to raise
any questions such as the admissibility of certain evidence before the
Magistrate or any technical matters that the notice should properly set forth
such grounds specifically. Here, however, it would appear that the issues would
be confined to the question of impairment while driving.

This passage, when read in conjunction with the
decision in Regina v. Souter, supra, appears to me to indicate that the
Court of Appeal of Ontario was of opinion that a “question as to the
admissibility of certain evidence before the Magistrate” could be an issue at
the trial de novo, whereas, with the greatest respect, I take the view
that the only evidence upon which the Appeal Court judge can base his decision
is the evidence introduced before him either directly or pursuant to s. 727(2),
and the fact that evidence may have been wrongly admitted by the magistrate
cannot be

[Page 613]

an issue at the trial de novo because the
judge of the Appeal Court has
control of what evidence is or is not to be admitted before him. See Regina v. Dennis[7].
No matter how grave or prejudicial the magistrate’s errors may be in taking the
evidence at the initial trial, they do not entitle an appellant to a favourable
decision in the Appeal Court.
Such errors afford good ground for the appellant believing that he was wrongly
convicted but they form no part of the material upon which the appeal is to be
decided.

In my view these considerations make it apparent
that the main function of the notice of appeal required by s. 722  is to provide
evidence of the appellant’s sincerity of purpose in asserting his appeal rather
than to indicate the specific issues to be raised at the second trial although
when the appellant is seeking to change his plea or to raise pure questions of
law apart from the evidence before the Appeal Court, it is desirable that the
notice of appeal should be in such form as to make the respondent aware of the
reasons to be urged in support of the change of plea or the nature of the legal
points which are to be raised.

As I have indicated, I am of opinion that,
subject to the limitations above referred to, it is quite legitimate in cases
such as the present for the notice of appeal to confine itself to raising the
broad issue of whether or not the accused has been wrongly convicted and that
sufficient grounds were set forth in the notices of appeal before His Honour,
Judge R. Stewart Clark, to comply with s. 722  of the Criminal Code  and
to clothe the said judge with jurisdiction to hear the said appeals by way of
trial de novo.

I would accordingly allow the appeals, set aside
the orders of the Court of Appeal and the County Court judge and remit the
cases to the County Court judge to be heard by way of trial de novo.

FAUTEUX J.:—Being of opinion that the notice of
appeal, to the County Court of the County of Peel, met the requirements of s.
722(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code  in setting as a ground of appeal
in each case:

That the said conviction was contrary to
law, the evidence and the weight of evidence

[Page 614]

I would dispose of the appeals to this Court as
proposed by our brother Ritchie.

Appeals allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Sunday observance—Coin-operated
automatic laundry open on Sunday—Owner and employees not in attendance—Whether
“carrying on business of ordinary calling”—Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171,
s. 4.

The accused was charged with carrying on
business on Sunday contrary to s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C., 1952,
c. 171. As the owner of an automatic laundry business, the accused operated two
establishments which remained open and in use by the public on a Sunday. The
premises in question contained automatic washing machines and dryers which
customers could operate automatically by inserting a

[Page 593]

coin in a slot. The soap and bleach were
supplied by the customers but the water and electricity were furnished by the
accused. On the Sunday in question the police found customers operating the
machines at both premises. Neither the accused nor any of his servants or
agents were present. There was a sign on the wall with instructions as to the
operation of the machines and another sign giving telephone numbers to be
called in case of emergency.

The accused was acquitted, but the Court of
Appeal directed that a verdict of guilty be entered. The accused was granted
leave to appeal to this Court.

Held (Cartwright
J. dissenting): The accused was guilty of carrying on the business of his
ordinary calling on Sunday within the meaning of s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act.

Per Kerwin
C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The
evidence adduced indicated that the business carried on by the accused on the
Sunday in question was “of his ordinary calling”. The words of s. 4 were very
wide. Even in the absence of the accused or any of his servants or agents, he
was carrying on business on the Sunday in question. What he did in the ordinary
acceptance of the term was carrying on any business of his ordinary calling.

The question as to whether the accused was
carrying on a work of necessity and mercy within the meaning of s. 11 of the Lord’s
Day Act was not raised before the County Court Judge, whose decision was
appealed to the Court of Appeal, and in the absence of any evidence as to what
was being washed or dried in the machines, the point could not be considered.

Per Locke,
Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The conduct of the accused fell within the
prohibition of s. 4. The presence of the proprietor or his servants was an
irrelevant circumstance in the situation disclosed by the evidence in the
present case. The uncontradicted evidence given before the County Court Judge
was sufficient to establish that the business carried on by the accused was
that of his ordinary calling.

If it were intended by the accused to contend
that the operation fell within the exception of s. 11 of the Act, the onus was
on him to prove it. The accused, however, called no evidence and there was none
in the case for the prosecution upon which such a finding could conceivably be
made.

Per Cartwright
J., dissenting: On the facts found by the County Court Judge, the latter
was right in law in holding that the accused was not carrying on the business
of his ordinary calling on the day in question within the meaning of those
words as used in s. 4. The Act is intended to prevent people from working on
Sundays, and to come within the words “carry on business” there must be some
act of a positive nature, the doing of something. The Act forbids actions, it
does not forbid omissions. On its true construction s. 4 makes the doing of
some act on Sunday an essential ingredient of an offence against the section.
In the case at bar nothing was done by the accused or any of his employees in
connection with the business.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] setting aside a
verdict of acquittal. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.

[Page 594]

A.M. Ferriss, Q.C., for the appellant.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau,
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—By leave of this Court Lewis
E. Gordon appeals from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1
allowing appeals by the Attorney General for Ontario against the orders of His
Honour Judge Carscallen on appeals before the latter by way of trials de
novo from the acquittal by a magistrate of the appellant of charges based
upon two informations. In one of these it was alleged that the appellant “did
unlawfully carry on the business of his ordinary calling, to wit, washing
clothes (Automatic Laundry) at 469 N. Christina Street, in the City of Sarnia,
contrary to The Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171, s. 4”; in the other he was
charged with the same offence but with reference to 102 East Street, in the
City of Sarnia. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeals, set aside the verdict
of acquittal on each charge and directed that a verdict of guilty be entered
against the appellant and a fine of ten dollars on each charge and of the costs
of the proceedings before the magistrate be imposed, and that, in default of
such payment, the appellant be imprisoned for a period of five days.

Section 4 of the Lord’s Day Act is
as follows:

4. It is not lawful for any person on the
Lord’s Day, except as provided herein, or in any provincial Act or law now or
hereafter in force, to sell or offer for sale or purchase any goods, chattels,
or other personal property, or any real estate, or to carry on or transact any
business of his ordinary calling, or in connection with such calling, or for
gain to do, or employ any other person to do, on that day, any work, business,
or labour.

There is in the record a licence, dated January
5, 1959, from the City of Sarnia, to “Econ‑O‑Wash, 469 N.
Christina, per Lewis Gordon, to enable him to use and exercise the calling and
business of keeper of a laundry until the 31st day of December, 1959”. Evidence
was given by the landlord of the premises at 102 East
 Street that he had rented them to the appellant and
that the same type of business was carried on by the appellant at both
addresses.

[Page 595]

There is also in the record a certified copy of
a declaration by the appellant, dated March 25, 1959, under The Partnership
Registration Act of Ontario, that he has had carried on and intended to
carry on a coin-operated laundry business at 469 N. Christina Street, in the
City of Sarnia, under the name of “Econ-O-Wash”; that the business had subsisted
since February 20, 1959, since which date he was the sole partner of the said
business.

The premises at each address contained automatic
washing machines and dryers. Customers supplied their own soap and bleach and
by inserting a coin in a slot the articles they brought with them would be
automatically washed or dried in the appropriate machines by the water and
electricity furnished by the appellant. On Sunday, November 22, 1959, two
policemen entered the premises at each of the above addresses of which the
doors were unlocked. At one of the addresses at least there was a sign on a
wall with instructions as to the operation of the machines and another sign
reading: “This store designed and equipped by L. Gordon, 469 N. Christina Street, Sarnia” and there was also a pay telephone to which was attached a card
with the information “Emergency No. Call Ed6-2201, Di4-0854”. A number of
persons were present at each of the premises and there were a number of
automatic washers or a number of dryers in operation. Neither the appellant nor
any of his servants or agents were present at either of the premises.

Leave to appeal was granted on the points
mentioned in the notice of application therefore but the only important
argument requiring consideration was that it was not possible to say, within
the meaning of s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act, that the appellant was a
person who carried on or transacted any business of his ordinary calling on
Sunday. The learned County Court judge found that there was evidence that the
appellant was the proprietor of both stores on the date in question. He defined
the issue before him as being “if the evidence indicates that the accused was
carrying on or transacting business on 22nd November, 1959”. There is no
suggestion in his judgment that if the appellant were carrying on business on
that date that it was not “of his ordinary calling”. The evidence adduced

[Page 596]

indicates that it was, and there is no evidence
to the contrary. The words of s. 4 are very wide. The decisions in the Courts
of the State of New York
referred to on the argument and also the later judgment of the Court of Appeals
in People v. Welt[2] are
interesting but do not assist me in construing s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act. I
have no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that even in the absence of
the appellant or any of his servants or agents he was carrying on business on
the Sunday in question. Presuming that on Sunday he would not go or send
someone to either establishment in order to collect the money that had been
deposited in the slot machines and that he or his servant or agent would not go
on a Sunday to repair any of the machines, what he did in the ordinary
acceptance of the term was carrying on any business of his ordinary calling.

Counsel for the appellant referred us to a
decision of the High Court of Australia in Spence v. Ravenscroft[3], There, however, Spence was charged
with an offence under a section of an Act that provided “whosoever trades
or deals or keeps open any shop, store or other place for the purpose of
trading or dealing on Sunday… shall be liable to a penalty”. The majority of
the Court held that “trades” was to be narrowly construed, saying at p. 352:

We think that the word “trades” is not used
in sec. 61 in the wide sense of keeping a place of business open for
trading, which is dealt with by the succeeding words of the section, but is
limited to personal acts done on Sunday in the nature of trading.

I can find no assistance in this decision in
coming to a solution in the present case nor in the reasons for judgment of
Laidlaw J.A., speaking for himself, in Re Pszon[4]. What was there in issue was the
question as to whether a man was carrying on business within the meaning of the
Bankruptcy Act,—a statute enacted for an entirely different purpose and
any decision under it can have no relevancy to the matter now before us.

Counsel for the appellant stated that while
before the magistrate the question arose as to whether the appellant was
carrying on a work of necessity and mercy within the meaning of s. 11 of
the Lord’s Day Act, no such question was raised before the County Court
judge and it was from

[Page 597]

the decisions of the latter that appeals were
taken to the Court of Appeal. There is nothing in the evidence to show what was
being washed or dried in the machines and in the absence of any such evidence
the point cannot be considered. It is, therefore, unnecessary to express any
opinion as to the decision of the District Court judge in Regina v. Coin
Launder-All Limited[5].

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgement of Locke, Martland, Judson and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

LOCKE J.:—In the premises operated by the
appellant at 102 East Street
and 469 North Christina Street
in Sarnia there were placed
numbers of automatic washing machines and drying machines. Upon placing a sum
of .20cts. in a slot the washing machine, using water supplied by the
appellant, operated for 10 minutes, the motive power being electricity, also
supplied by him. The drying machines operated for a similar period of time when
.10cts. was placed in the slot. The public availing themselves of this service
supplied their own soap or detergent. In return for the deposit of .05cts. in
another slot machine the customer could purchase a supply of detergent for this
purpose. In the premises there were signs instructing customers that, in case
of emergency, they should call a given telephone number.

The carrying on of this business was thus
entirely automatic. Whether either the appellant or anyone on his behalf were
present on the premises during the week is not shown.

On the Sunday referred to in the charges,
neither the appellant nor anyone on his behalf were there and the question to
be determined is whether, by reason of this, the appellant was not carrying on
or transacting any business of his ordinary calling or in connection therewith
on the Lord’s Day, within the meaning of s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 171.

The situation does not appear to me to differ in
any respect from that which would arise if the proprietor of a self-service
grocery store left his premises open and unattended on Sunday, thus inviting
the public, to enter and

[Page 598]

to purchase his goods at the marked price. It
seems to me quite impossible to suggest that such conduct would not fall within
the prohibition of s.4. The presence or absence of the proprietor or his
servants is, in my opinion, an irrelevant circumstance in the situation
disclosed by the evidence in the present case.

The learned County Court judge relied in
acquitting the appellant upon a passage in a judgment of Laidlaw J.A. in Re
Pszon[6], in
which that learned judge expressed his opinion as to what constituted carrying
on business within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act. In the passage
quoted it was said that a person who devoted no time or attention or labour to
the working or conduct of the affairs of an enterprise does not carry on the
business of that enterprise. But here the appellant actively carried on this
business throughout every day of the week, merely absenting himself from the
premises on Sunday. The passage quoted has, in my opinion, no application in
these circumstances and does not bear the meaning sought to be assigned to it
by the appellant. If it were treated as applicable, the operator of the self‑service
grocery store above mentioned would not be carrying on business.

Reliance is also placed upon the decision of the
Divisional Court in Willesden
Urban District v. Morgan[7]. The
prosecution in that case was under the Shops Act 1912, which required
that every shop should be closed for the serving of customers on the weekly
half-holiday. The accused person had affixed to the door of his shop an
automatic machine by which a supply of milk was offered to the public on the
insertion of a penny in the slot provided for that purpose. The court
considered that the language of the relevant section should be construed
as a prohibition of the personal serving of customers and that the purpose of
the Act was to provide a weekly half-holiday for shop assistants which was not
interfered with. The language of the sections under consideration differed
materially from that of s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act and the case affords
no support for the appellant’s contention, in my opinion.

[Page 599]

We were also referred to three American cases: the
People v. Kaplan[8]; the
People v. Welt[9]; and
the People v. Andob Corporation[10].

The section of the Penal Law considered
in these three cases read:

All trades, manufactures, agricultural or
mechanical employments upon the first day of the week are prohibited, except
that when the same are works of necessity they may be performed on that day in
their usual and orderly manner, so as not to interfere with the repose and
religious liberty of the community.

In Kaplan’s case it was decided that to
operate a self-service automatic coin laundry on a Sunday violated this
section.

In Welt’s case the Court arrived at a
different conclusion without giving reasons.

In the Andob Corporation case, evidence
was given by several witnesses that the use of the laundry on Sunday was a
necessity for them and not a mere convenience within the meaning of the
section and McCullough J. who wrote the judgment of the Court quoted with
approval a passage from a judgment of a lower Court in Welt’s case,
saying that not all businesses are prohibited on Sunday but only those which
are serious interruptions of the Sabbath. It is not clear as to whether this
was the ground upon which the judgment proceeded.

The language of the section of the Penal
Law differs so materially from s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act and the
evidence given in the last two is of such a different nature to that in the
present matter that I obtain no assistance from them.

In Spence v. Ravenscroft[11], the judgment of the majority
written by Griffith C.J. appears to have proceeded on the view that the history
of the legislation as to Sunday observance in New South
 Wales indicated that s. 61 of the Police Offences
Act 1901 should be construed as importing a personal act or omission of the
person charged. Isaacs J. dissented in a carefully reasoned judgment and, with
great respect, I agree with the opinion expressed by him. There is nothing in
the history of the Lord’s Day Act since it was

[Page 600]

first enacted in 1906 to justify a conclusion
similar to that reached by the majority in Ravenscroft’s case and I
think the case has no application.

The uncontradicted evidence given before the
County Court judge, in my opinion, was sufficient to establish that the
businesses carried on by the appellant were those of his ordinary calling and,
while the learned County Court judge made no finding as to this, no issue was
made of the matter before us.

It appears from the reasons for judgment
delivered by the Court of Appeal that before that Court it was contended that
the operation of the business, so far as the customers were concerned, was a
work of necessity and, therefore, came within the exempting provisions of s. 11
of the Lord’s Day Act. The question had not been considered either by
the learned magistrate nor by the learned County Court judge and no evidence
was adduced as to this at the hearing before the latter. Accordingly, the Court
expressed no opinion on the point.

Section 11 provides an exception in the
case of any work of necessity or mercy. If it were intended by the appellant to
contend that the operation fell within this exception, the onus was on him to
prove it by reason of the provisions of s. 702(2)  of the Criminal Code . The
appellant, however, elected to call no evidence and there is none in the case
for the prosecution upon which a finding such as is suggested could conceivably
be made.

I would dismiss these appeals.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This appeal
is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario[12]
pronounced on October 17, 1960, allowing appeals from orders of His Honour
Judge Carscallen and directing that a verdict of guilty be entered against the
appellant on each of two charges, that in each case a fine of $10.00 be imposed
and that the appellant do pay the costs of the proceedings in the Magistrate’s
Court.,

The first of these charges was as follows:

That on or about the 22nd day of November,
1959, at the City of Sarnia, Lewis E. Gordon, 469 Christina Street,
Sarnia. Did unlawfully carry on the business of his ordinary calling, to wit,
washing clothes

[Page 601]

(Automatic Laundry) at 102 East Street in
the City of Sarnia, contrary to the Lord’s Day Act, Revised Statutes of Canada
1952, Chapter 171, Section 4.

The second charge was in the same words as the
first except that the words “at 102 East Street’’ were replaced by the words
“at 469 North Christina Street”.

The appellant was tried on both charges before
His Worship Magistrate Dunlap and was acquitted. The informant appealed to the
County Court of the County of Lambton. The appeals were heard separately by way
of trials de novo by His Honour Judge Carscallen and were dismissed.

The informant served notice of an application
for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against these orders of acquittal on
the following ground:

1. The learned County Court Judge erred in
law in the interpretation of the words ‘to carry on or transact any business of
his ordinary calling’ as they appear in Section 4 of the Lord’s Day Act,
R.S.C. 1952, Chapter 123.

The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is
conferred by s. 743  of the Criminal Code  which provides inter alia that,
with leave of that Court, an appeal may be taken on any ground that involves a
question of law alone against a decision of a court in respect of an appeal
under s. 727 , which was the section pursuant to which the appeals to
His Honour Judge Carscallen had been heard.

Up to a point, the relevant facts are not in
dispute; they were summarized as follows by Schroeder J.A. who at the
conclusion of the argument delivered orally the unanimous judgment of the Court
of Appeal.

The premises referred to were either owned
or controlled by the respondent and they contained automatic washing machines
and dryers which customers could operate automatically by inserting a coin in a
slot. The soap and bleach used in the cleaning operation were supplied by the
customer, but the water and electricity were furnished by the accused, as owner
of the establishment.

The evidence indicates that on Sunday,
November 22nd, 1959, both places were visited by two members of the Sarnia
Police force. They found five persons in attendance at 469 North Christina
Street and twelve washers and two dryers were in operation. Neither the accused
nor any of his servants or agents were present. There was a sign on the wall
containing instructions as to how to operate the machines and another sign
which read ‘this store designed and equipped by L. Gordon, 469 North Christina
Street, Sarnia’. Over the pay telephone in the premises there was a card
bearing the words ‘Emergency No. call Ed.6-2201. Di.4-0854.’

[Page 602]

At the East Street premises there were
eight persons present and four dryers in operation. These premises were
furnished in a manner similar to the North Christina Street premises and the
same information as to operation of the machines was posted on the wall. Here
again neither the accused nor his servants or agents or any of them were in
attendance.

The reasons of the learned Justice of Appeal
continue:

The learned trial Judge found, on the
evidence, that the accused was the sole proprietor of the business in question
and that the operation thereof was his ordinary calling.

The last quoted statement appears to be
inaccurate; while the learned County Judge found that the appellant was the
sole proprietor of the business at the two locations mentioned in the charges
he made no express finding that the operation of those businesses was the
ordinary calling of the appellant and, since he acquitted the appellant on both
charges, no such finding can be said to be implicit in his reasons.

The appellant applied to this Court for leave to
appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the following grounds:

(i) The learned Court of Appeal erred in
law in holding that the appellant was carrying on or transacting any business
of his ordinary calling within the meaning of the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952,
Chapter 123.

(ii) The learned Court of Appeal erred in
law in holding that the fact that neither the accused nor his servants or agents
were on the premises to take part in or supervise the conduct of the automatic
laundry, was irrelevant.

(iii) The learned Court of Appeal erred in
holding on the evidence that the operation of a coin-operated automatic laundry
was the ordinary calling carried on by the appellant, the evidence being silent
on this question, and erred in believing that the learned County Court Judge
has so found.

Leave was granted by this Court on November 14,
1960; the operative part of the order reads as follows:

This Court did Order and Adjudge that leave
to Appeal from the said Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario should be
and the same was granted.

The main question arising on this appeal is
whether on the facts found by the learned County Court Judge, which have been
summarized above, he was right in law in holding that the accused was not
carrying on the business of his

[Page 603]

ordinary calling on the date stated within the
meaning of those words as used in s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act. That
section reads as follows:

4. It is not lawful for any person on the
Lord’s Day except as provided herein, or in any Provincial Act or law now or
hereafter in force, to sell or offer for sale or purchase any goods, chattels
or other personal property or any real estate or to carry on or transact any
business of his ordinary calling or in connection with such calling or for gain
to do or employ any other person to do on that day any work, business or
labour.

In his reasons the learned County Judge, after
stating that he had not been referred to and had not found any decided case
dealing with the meaning of the phrase “carry on business” as used in s. 4 of
the Lord’s Day Act, considered the judgment of Laidlaw J.A. in Re
Pszon[13]. In
that case it was necessary to consider the meaning of the phrase “carrying on
business” as used in the Bankruptcy Act. Laidlaw J.A., after stating
that it involved at least three elements (i) the occupation of time, attention
and labour; (ii) the incurring of liabilities to other persons; and, (iii) the
purpose of a livelihood or profit, went on to say at page 234:

A person who devotes no time or attention
or labour, by himself or by servants or employees, to the working or conduct of
the affairs of an enterprise does not carry on the business of such enterprise.

Having quoted from this judgment the learned
County Court Judge continued:

Applying the above to the facts in the
instant cases, I cannot find that the accused was carrying on business on
Sunday, November 22nd, 1959. He was not, either by himself or by his servants
or employees, devoting any time, attention or labour to the business of washing
clothes. The very nature of the machines used for that purpose rendered his
time, attention or labour unnecessary on that day. He did not give attention or
perform labour for the maintenance or furtherance of the undertaking nor devote
time to the accomplishment of its objects.

I agree with the conclusion arrived at by the
learned County Court Judge and I am in substantial agreement with his reasons
and with those of the learned Magistrate, but in view of the importance of the
question raised and the difference of opinion in the courts below and in this
Court I propose to state my reasons in my own words.

[Page 604]

In Willesden Urban Council v. Morgan1[14], the Divisional Court had to
consider, inter alia, whether vending milk by means of an automatic machine
amounted to carrying on the retail trade or business of a dairyman. The statute
there under consideration was the Shops Act, (1912) 2 Geo. V, c. 3, the
wording of which differs considerably from that of the Lord’s Day Act but
the following observations in the judgments appear to me to be of assistance as
indicating the proper approach to the problem of construction.

At p. 353, Ridley J. said:

The Shops Act, 1912, was passed for
the benefit of those who serve as shop assistants; but it is an Act whose
provisions are enforced by the infliction of penalties, and we have therefore
to be careful how we construe it. We have to be sure that while we give it a
fair reading we do not give it too wide a construction. Being intended for the
benefit of those serving in shops, the Act is not intended to prevent people
buying goods so long as their doing so does not interfere with the object of
the Act. I should not assent to any construction of the Act which would prevent
shop assistants obtaining their weekly half‑holiday; but I do not think
that we should so construe it as to make it apply to the supply of articles by
automatic machines unless the language of the Act compels us to do so. Sect. 4
is satisfied by reading the words ‘for the serving of customers’ as meaning
‘for the personal serving of customers.’

At p. 354 Lush J. said:

The case is one in which I think it is most
necessary to apply that fundamental rule—a rule founded on good sense rather
than on law—that where words in a statute are capable of two different meanings
we must carefully consider, before determining which of the two meanings to
attribute to them, what the mischief is which the Act was intended to obviate.

I do not think it necessary to review the
history of legislation dealing with the observance of the Lord’s Day. This has
been recently done in the judgments delivered in this Court in Henry Birks
and Sons (Montreal) Ltd. et al. v. City of Montreal et al.[15] and a more extensive review is to
be found in Holmsted, The Sunday Law in Canada (1912). I think it safe to say
that the origin of this sort of legislation in Christian countries is to be
found in Exodus c. 20 verses 8 to 11, where the words of prohibition are
“in it thou shalt not do any work”.

[Page 605]

I agree with the submission of Mr. Ferriss
that to come within the words “carry on business” in s. 4 of the Lord’s Day
Act there must be some act of a positive nature, the doing of something.

In the case at bar the evidence is that on the
Sunday in question neither the accused nor any employee of his did anything at
all in connection with the laundry business. There is no evidence that either
of the telephone numbers listed on the notice in the shops to be called in case
of emergency was that of the accused or of any employee of his; but that is of
little importance for we do not have to consider what would have been the
result if either the accused or an employee had been called and had responded;
that did not happen.

I am in agreement with the judgment of the High
Court of Australia in Spence v. Ravenscroft[16]. Griffith C.J. with the concurrence
of Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ. says at page 352:

Prima facie a
law creating an offence imports a personal act or omission on the part of a
human actor. If the day on which the act is done, or omission is made is
material, it imports a personal act or omission on that day. A person may, of
course, be responsible for the conduct of his agents. The subject-matter of the
law or context of the enactment may require a larger construction. In this case
there is no such context. As to subject‑matter the history of the
legislation as to Sunday observance shows that it is all directed to personal
conduct on that day. The provision now in question is one dealing with that
subject, and not with trade in general.

The reasoning in this passage and particularly
the sentence I have italicized appears to me to be applicable to the question
now before us. It is hardly necessary to observe that the Lord’s Day Act forbids
actions, it does not forbid omissions.

In the course of the argument reference was made
to a number of cases decided in the courts of the State of New York dealing
with the question whether the operation of a self-service automatic
coin-operated laundry on Sunday was a breach of s. 2146 of the Penal Law, which
provides that all trades, manufactures, agricultural or mechanical employments
on the first day of the week are prohibited “except that when the same are
works of necessity they may be

[Page 606]

performed on that day in their usual and orderly
manner, so as not to interfere with the repose and religious liberty of the
comunity”. These decisions disclose a conflict of opinion as to whether a
breach of the section is committed when the place in which the
coin-operated laundry is located is left open to and used by members of the
public on Sunday but neither the owner of the business nor any employee of his
is present on that day.

That conflict appears to have been finally
resolved in the State of New York by the judgment of the Court of Appeals in People
v. Welt[17], delivered
on July 8, 1960, in which the Court unanimously affirmed a judgment of the
County Court of Nassau County reversing a conviction and dismissing the charge.
The report is brief but the judgment is discussed by McCullough J. in the case
of People v. Andob Corporation[18]. It
appears from the last mentioned judgment that in People v. Welt, supra, the
Court of Appeals had before it the judgment of the First Appellate Division in People
v. Kaplan[19] and
that the judgment of the majority in that case must be regarded as over-ruled.
In People v. Andob Corporation, supra, the present state of the law in
the State of New York is summed up as follows at page 93:

It is, therefore, now the law in New York
that it is not a violation of s. 2146 of the Penal Law to operate an automatic
coin operated laundromat on Sunday where the owner or any employee is not
present on such day.

It follows from my agreement with Mr. Ferriss’
submission that on its true construction s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act makes
the doing of some act on Sunday an essential ingredient of an offence against
the section that I would allow the appeal and it becomes unnecessary to
deal with other matters mentioned during the argument; but I do not wish to be
understood as agreeing either (i) that it was within the power of the Court of
Appeal to make the finding of fact, which the learned County Court Judge did
not make, that “the operation of a coin‑operated automatic laundromat and
dryers is the business of his ordinary calling carried on by the accused”, or
(ii) that it was open to the Court of Appeal to substitute a verdict of guilty
for that of acquittal without

[Page 607]

having reached a conclusion as to the
applicability of s. 11 of the Lord’s Day Act to the facts found by the
learned County Court Judge. Assuming, contrary to the view which I have
expressed, that the appellant did on the Sunday in question, within the meaning
of section 4, “carry on the business of his ordinary calling, to wit,
washing clothes (Automatic Laundry)”, the question whether he was thereby doing
a work of necessity or mercy within the meaning of s. 11 was put in issue by
the plea of “not guilty”. If on the facts as found by the learned County Court
Judge it became a question of law whether the conduct which the Court of Appeal
regarded as a breach of s. 4 fell within s. 11, the Court of Appeal should have
dealt with that question; if on the other hand it was, as the Court of Appeal
indicated, a mixed question of fact and law, that Court could not deal with it
and should have remitted the cases to the learned County Court Judge. In making
this observation I have not overlooked the provisions of s. 702  of the Criminal
Code , placing upon the accused the burden of proving that an exception
prescribed by law operates in his favour; in the case at bar, the evidence
given on behalf of the prosecution proved everything necessary to be known as
to the nature of what was done by the accused to enable the appropriate
tribunal to determine whether or not it fell within s. 11. Until a finding on
that point adverse to the accused has been made by a tribunal having
jurisdiction to make it I am unable to see how a verdict of guilty can validly be
entered against him. However, I do not pursue these questions further.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgments of the learned County Court
Judge.

Present: Judson J. in Chambers.

Criminal law—Habeas corpus—Counselling to commit perjury
before Registrar of Saskatchewan Securities Commission—Whether examination by
Registrar a judicial proceeding—Registrar's power to examine on oath— Solemn
declaration—Perjury—Powers of Court on habeas corpus—The Securities Act, 1954
(Sask.), c. 89, s. 13—The Saskatchewan Evidence Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 73, s.
41—Criminal Code , 1953–54 (Can.), c. 61, ss. 22, 112, 114.

The petitioner, a barrister and solicitor, was committed for
trial in Saskatchewan on an indictment of ten charges. Seven charges were that
the petitioner counselled seven named individuals to commit perjury in their
examination before the Registrar of the Saskatchewan Securities Commission held
pursuant to s. 13 of The Securities Act, 1954 (Sask.), and thereby
became a party to the said perjury by reason of s. 22(1)  of the Criminal
Code . The other charges were that he counselled and procured one L to make
a false declaration on oath before an authorized person and thereby became a
party to an offence under s. 114  of the Criminal Code . The plaintiff
applied to the Supreme Court of Canada for a writ of habeas corpus on
two grounds: (1) that there was no offence at law shown in the first seven
charges because the examination of the individuals before the Registrar was not
a judicial proceeding within the meaning of s. 112  of the Criminal Code ; and
(2) that L was not a person permitted, authorized or required by law to make
the said declaration within the meaning of s. 114  of the Criminal Code , and
that there existed no authorization at law for the taking or receiving of these
solemn declarations.

Held: The application was dismissed.

Under s. 13 of The Securities Act, 1954, the Registrar
had by law authority to examine under oath. He also had the power to administer
the oath if not under that section then under s. 41 of The Saskatchewan
Evidence Act. Consequently, counts one to seven disclosed offences known to
the law and for which the accused was properly committed for trial.

The jurisdiction of this Court in a writ of habeas corpus was
limited to a consideration of the warrant of committal and other germane order,
and if they were regular on their face, that was the end of the matter. The
Court in such a writ has no more power to look at the solemn declarations
alleged to have been made than it has to look at the evidence given on a
preliminary hearing. No distinction can be drawn between a warrant of committal
before and one after conviction.

APPLICATION before Judson J. in chambers for a writ of habeas
corpus. Application dismissed.

A. W. Embury, Q.C., and P. H. Gordon, Q.C.,
for the petitioner.

N. L. Mathews, Q.C., and J. P.
Nelligan, contra.

[Page 39]

The following judgment was delivered

Judson J.
(orally):—This is an application for habeas corpus. Before I can deal
intelligibly with the issues raised on the application, I think I should set
out in chronological order the steps that have been taken in this prosecution
before the application was launched.

The accused came before the magistrate on a summons
containing eleven charges on which the magistrate conducted a preliminary
hearing lasting seven days. He committed the accused for trial on all charges
except number nine, in which he made an amendment to reduce it to
""counselling, procuring or inciting the commission of an offence""
which was not committed, under s. 407 (a) of the Criminal Code .

I should say at this point that the magistrate on that date,
that is, the 30th November 1960, signed no warrant of committal. He admitted
the accused to bail immediately on his own recognizance.

On January 23, 1961, an indictment containing eleven counts
was preferred against the accused in the Court of Queen's Bench presided over
by Mr. Justice Disbery. Without analyzing the counts in the indictment in
detail, it is accurate, I think, to say that they are substantially in the same
form as the charges contained in the summons before the magistrate, as amended.

I can make this rough classification at this point, that the
first seven counts in the indictment have to do with counselling seven named
individuals to commit perjury before the Registrar under The Securities Act of
 Saskatchewan and an allegation that that offence of perjury was afterwards
committed. The charge, therefore, on the first seven counts was that of
perjury.

Count number eight charged an attempt to obstruct and defeat
the course of justice by attempting to induce the seven named individuals in
the first seven counts to give false evidence in a judicial proceeding, namely,
an examination before the Registrar under The Securities Act.

Counts nine, ten and eleven have to do with procuring or
inciting two named individuals to make a solemn declaration.

I will deal with all these counts in more detail later.

[Page 40]

Counsel for the accused moved to quash all counts in the
indictment. The application was dismissed by the trial judge, with the
exception of count number eight on which the accused had elected a non-jury
trial and on which the Crown had no right of election before a judge and jury.
Count number eight, therefore, requires no further consideration here.

The remaining counts were then severed and the accused was
arraigned on counts nine, ten and eleven. He pleaded not guilty.

At the conclusion of the evidence there was a motion for a
directed verdict, which was rejected by the trial judge. The jury found the
accused not guilty on count eleven and disagreed on counts nine and ten.

The trial judge then adjourned the trial on counts nine and
ten and the remaining seven counts, counts one to seven, to the next sittings
of the Court to be held in May 1961; and continued the bail.

The next step was a motion by the accused before the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the committal
for trial on counts one to seven and counts nine and ten and to quash the
indictments corresponding to those counts. Judgment was given dismissing this
application on August 16, 1961, and on September 15, 1961, the accused launched
this application for habeas corpus.

On September 15, 1961, the accused was still at liberty on
bail, but on Monday, September 18, he appeared before Judge Hogarth and,
according to the order made by Judge Hogarth on that day, surrendered himself
into the custody of the judge for the purpose of satisfying the conditions of
the recognizance; and applied to be relieved of his obligations under the terms
of the recognizance and no longer acknowledged himself to be bound by its
terms.

The order recites that the accused was so relieved of his
obligations and then commands W. H. Williams, Sheriff of the Judicial Centre of
Regina, to take the accused into custody and convey him to
Regina Gaol.

On the same day, an order was made by a Judge of this Court
directing the issue of a Writ of Habeas Corpus to W. H. Williams, the Sheriff,
and to the Keeper of the Regina

[Page 41]

Gaol, to have the body of the accused before the judge
making the order on September 25, 1961. At that time the accused was admitted
to bail. The writ was served but no formal return to the writ has been made.

I have before me, first of all, the recognizance entered into
by the accused on November 30, 1960; a copy of the order of Judge Hogarth; and
a certified copy of a warrant of committal dated November 30, 1960.I have
already mentioned that this warrant was not signed on that day because the
accused was immediately admitted to bail.

There is evidence before me that this warrant was not signed
until September 21, or possibly September 22. In any event, I am not in any
doubt how the accused came to be in custody and I assume that if any formal
return had been made it would recite the facts that I have recited.

The application for habeas corpus is made on two grounds—the
first ground having reference to the first seven counts and the second ground
having reference to counts nine and ten. The first seven counts have been
referred to throughout these proceedings as the ""registrar charges""
and counts nine and then have been referred to as ""Leier charges"".

I will set out now count number one, the first of the
registrar charges. The others are in exactly the same terms but with a
different name. I am quoting not from the indictment but from the summons.

The first charge is that the accused, during the month of
January 1958, at the City of Regina, did counsel another
person, to wit, one Edward Joseph Leier to commit the
offence of perjury, which offence was afterwards committed by the said Edward
Joseph Leier at the examination before the Registrar of
the Saskatchewan Securities Commission held pursuant to s. 13 of The
Securities Act, 1954, on the 23rd day of January, A.D. 1958, by swearing
falsely to the following effect:

(a) that he did not make
certain representations to prospective purchasers of shares in Columbia Metals
Exploration Co. Ltd., including statements regarding the listing of the shares,
the resultant increase in the price of the shares, the financial position of
the said Company, and its association with other companies, including the Ford
Motor Company, and

[Page 42]

(b) that the information
contained in the said representations was not given to him by Walter Luboff,
and

(c) that he could not
remember certain facts which he did actually remember,

while knowing the same to be false and with intent to
mislead the said Registrar contrary to the Criminal Code , and did
thereby become a party to the said perjury by virtue of 22(1) of the Criminal
Code .

When the Registrar charges became the first seven counts in
the indictment the application to quash was based on the same argument that has
been addressed to me on this motion for habeas corpus. Its outlines are set out
in the Notice of the application.

The argument is that there is no offence at law shown in
these counts, because the examination before the Registrar of the Saskatchewan
Securities Commission which he is said to have held under s. 13 of The
Securities Act, 1954, is not a judicial proceeding within s. 112  of the Criminal
Code . Section 112  of the Criminal Code  reads:

Every one commits perjury who, being a witness in a judicial
proceeding, with intent to mislead gives false evidence, knowing that the
evidence is false.

""Judicial proceeding"" is defined in s. 99 of the
Code. I think the only subsection that I am concerned with is para. (iv) of
subs. (c), which reads:

(c) ""judicial
proceeding"" means a proceeding

* * *

(iv) before an arbitrator or
umpire, or a person or body of persons authorized by law to make an inquiry and
take evidence therein under oath,

* * *

I next set out s. 13 of The Saskatchewan Securities Act, which
reads:

13. The registrar may and shall when so directed by the
commission require any further information or material to be submitted by any
applicant or any registered person or company within a specified time and may
require verification by affidavit or otherwise of any information or material
then or previously submitted or may require the applicant or the registered
person or any partner, officer, director or employee of the registered person
or company to submit to examination under oath.

[Page 43]

Counsel for the applicant submits that this section does not
authorize the registrar to make an inquiry or examination. His argument is that
if it did so authorize the registrar the concluding words of the section would
be, not ""to submit to examination under oath"" but ""to submit to
examination under oath before him"".

That is reducing the argument to its simplest elements. The
answer that is made by the Crown to it is that the plain meaning of the section
is that the registrar has this power to require the named person, in this case,
to submit to examination under oath and that the section cannot mean anything
else but submit to examination under oath before him.

Two other parts of the Act are referred to in support of
that argument. The first is s. 2(5) (f), which defines
""fraud"", in part, as

the making of a material false statement in any application,
information, material or evidence submitted or given to the commission or the
registrar under the provisions of this Act or the regulations, or in any prospectus
or return filed with the commission;

The subsection that I have just read, it is argued,
contemplates the giving of information, material or evidence to the registrar.

Section 65(1) (c) is also relevant. It provides:

65. (1) Every person, including any officer, director,
official or employee of a company, who is knowingly responsible for

* * *

(c) the making of any
material false statement in any application, information, statement, material
or evidence submitted or given under this Act or the regulations to the
commission, its representative, the registrar or any person appointed to make
an investigation or audit under this Act;

I have no doubt, after listening to the two arguments
and the reading of the sections that I have already mentioned, that the
registrar has the power under s. 13 to take evidence and to take evidence under
oath.

That was Mr. Justice Disbery's opinion when he dismissed the
motion to quash, and it is also my opinion.

I think it is the plain meaning of s. 13 that the registrar
may require this particular person to give this information under oath, to
submit to examination under oath and before the registrar. To what other
possible place or person could he send the man for examination?

[Page 44]

If the person to conduct the examination is the registrar, I
think it is implicit in the terms of the section too that the registrar can
administer the oath. In any event, there is s. 41 of The Saskatchewan
Evidence Act which I had better set out in full:

41. Every court, judge, police magistrate, justice of the
peace, arbitrator or other person now or hereafter having by law or by consent
of parties authority to hear, receive and examine evidence may administer an
oath to any witness who is legally called before such court, judge, police
magistrate, justice of the peace, arbitrator or other person respectively.

In my opinion the registrar, under s. 13, has by law
authority to examine under oath. I think he has, by s. 13, also the power to
administer the oath, but if he has not got that power by s. 13 of The
Securities Act, I think he has it by s. 41 of the Evidence Act.

I am therefore holding that counts one to seven do disclose
offences known to the law and that the accused was properly committed for trial
on those charges and that to that extent the motion to quash the committal on
those charges fails.

I turn now to counts nine and ten, referred to as the Leier charges. I set out count nine in full:

9. And further, that you during the month of August A.D.
1958 at the said City of Regina unlawfully did counsel or
procure one Edward Joseph Leier who, not being a witness
in a judicial proceeding but being permitted or authorized by law to make a
statement by solemn declaration, to make in such statement before a person who
is authorized by law to permit it to be made before her, assertions with
respect to matters of fact, opinion, belief or knowledge knowing the said
assertions to be false, and thereby to be a party to an offence against the
Criminal Code  section 114 , which offence was afterwards committed by the said
Edward Joseph Leier by solemn declaration declared at the
said City of Regina on the 14th day of August A.D. 1958,
and you did thereby become a party to the said offence against section 114  of
the Criminal Code  by virtue of section 22(1)  of the Criminal Code .

Count number ten is in the same terms, with this exception,
that the solemn declaration referred to was simply dated ""in the month of
August 1958"". Section 114  of the Criminal Code  reads:

114. Every one who, not being a witness in a judicial
proceeding but being permitted, authorized or required by law to make a
statement by affidavit, by solemn declaration or orally under oath, makes in
such a statement, before a person who is authorized by law to permit it to be
made before him, an assertion with respect to a matter of fact, opinion, belief
or knowledge, knowing that the assertion is false, is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

[Page 45]

The attack on these two counts is made on these
grounds— that Leier was not a person permitted, authorized
or required by law to make the solemn declarations referred to in counts nine
and ten and that there exists no authorization at law for the taking or
receiving of these solemn declarations.

The argument is that the phrase ""permitted, authorized
or required by law"" to make a statement, means permitted, authorized or
required by some substantive law; that the Crown must point to some statute
which permits, authorizes or requires Leier to make these
solemn declarations, and that there is no such statutory authorization.

The Crown's submission in answer to that is that Leier is permitted by s. 37  of the Canada Evidence Act  to
make this declaration if Part I of the Canada Evidence Act  is applicable
and, if it is not so applicable, he is permitted under provincial law to make
the declaration; and that the purpose of the declaration may very well
determine which law is applicable and the determination of the purpose is a
matter of evidence for the jury.

All that I have before me is the declaration itself. The
declaration does refer to a statement of claim in an action brought by a
plaintiff, whose name I cannot read, against Columbia Metals Exploration Co.
Ltd., Western Bond and Share Corporation Limited, William Luboff, John J.
Abbott, Edward Leier and Laurence Tetrault.

This brings me to the question of what use may be made of
this material on a motion for habeas corpus before a judge of this Court.

The Crown's submission is that I am limited to looking at
the warrant of committal and that I cannot look at these declarations and the
statement of claim any more than I can look at the evidence—seven or eight
volumes of it— given on the preliminary hearing.

The basis for that submission is to be found in a number of
cases decided in this Court going back to In re Trepanier1. This
and the other cases to which I propose to refer in a moment have to do with
motions for habeas corpus after a conviction. The present application is
brought in a case

[Page 46]

where there has been no conviction but only a committal for
trial and a bill of indictment preferred. It is suggested that that makes a
difference and I will deal with that later.

In Re Trepanier an application was made to a judge of this Court on behalf of a
person arrested on a warrant issued on a conviction, for a writ of habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid. The application was dismissed. Chief Justice
Ritchie said, at p. 113:

The jurisdiction of the magistrate being unquestionable over
the subject-matter of complaint and the person of the prisoner, and there being
no ground for alleging that the magistrate acted irregularly or beyond his
jurisdiction, and the conviction and warrant being admitted to be regular, the
only objection being that the magistrate erred on the facts and that the
evidence did not justify the conclusion as to the guilt of the prisoner arrived
at by the magistrate, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that we
cannot go behind the conviction and inquire into the merits of the case by the
use of the writ of habeas corpus.

It was also pointed out that there is no jurisdiction
in this Court to issue a writ of certiorari in aid of habeas corpus. The
certiorari provisions in the Supreme Court Act have to do with appellate
jurisdiction and not with jurisdiction in matters of habeas corpus which is
concurrent with that of jurisdiction of the judges of the Superior Courts of
the provinces.

The next case I refer to is Ex parte Macdonald2. That was also an
application for habeas corpus after there had been a conviction. At p. 687, the
judgment reads:

I believe therefore that the jurisdiction of a judge of the
Supreme Court in matters of habeas corpus in any criminal case, is limited to
an inquiry into the cause of commitment, that is, as disclosed by the warrant
of commitment, under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.

Finally on that point, in the case of In re Goldhar3, the principle to be found
in the previous cases reported in the court is reaffirmed in the plainest
terms. For example, Chief Justice Kerwin, at p. 435, says:

The Calendar is a certificate regular on its face that the
appellant was convicted by a court of competent criminal jurisdiction and
therefore it is impossible to go behind it on an application for habeas corpus;
Re Trepanier (1885) 12 S.C.R. 111; Re
Sproule (1886) 12 S.C.R. 140; In re Henderson (1930) S.C.R. 45, 1
D.L.R. 420. 52 C.C.C. 95.

[Page 47]

And to the same effect in the judgment of Mr. Justice
Fauteux, at p. 439:

The question, which counsel for the appellant admittedly
sought to be determined by way of habeas corpus proceedings, is stated in the
reasons for judgment of other members of the Court. In my view, it is one which
would require the consideration of the evidence at trial and which, in this
particular case, extends beyond the scope of matters to be inquired under a
similar process. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to convert the writ of
habeas corpus into a writ of error or an appeal and to confer, upon every one
having authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus, an appellate jurisdiction
over the orders and judgments of even the highest Courts. It is well settled
that the functions of such a writ do not extend beyond an inquiry into the
jurisdiction of the Court by which process the subject is held in custody and
into the validity of the process upon its face.

In my opinion the jurisdiction of this Court is
similarly limited in an inquiry into a committal for trial. In the absence of
power to issue a writ of certiorari in aid of habeas corpus, a judge of this
Court has no power to look at the evidence at the preliminary hearing or to
receive affidavit evidence relating to it.

My jurisdiction is limited to a consideration of the warrant
of committal and the other material that I have referred to—the recognizances
and the order of Judge Hogarth. I cannot look at evidence, whether a transcript
of the evidence at the preliminary hearing or evidence sought to be introduced
by way of affidavit identifying a portion of such evidence.

I am founding my reasons on this branch of the case entirely
on that principle and I am expressing no opinion on the point on which I heard
full argument—whether there does exist, by virtue of provincial legislation,
permission to take a declaration of this kind.

It was suggested that that power is to be found in 1835
legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and that that legislation is still in
force in some way in the Province of Saskatchewan. The applicant, on the other
hand, says that that legislation cannot have been in force after the year 1907
when The Saskatchewan Evidence Act was enacted. If that is so, any
statutory declaration made in Saskatchewan before the 1959 amendment to the Evidence
Act is invalid unless it comes within Part I of the Canada
Evidence Act . I am expressing no opinion on that point, but founding my
judgment on the lack of jurisdiction in this Court to do more

[Page 48]

than examine the warrant of committal, and to find that, if
it is regular on its face, that is the end of the matter. I am drawing no
distinction between a warrant of committal after conviction. I see no
distinction in principle between the two.

The application will therefore be dismissed.

The judgment will issue on the 10th October, 1961, to afford
the applicant an opportunity to apply to the full Court on that date for bail
and, in the meantime, I continue the bail.

Application dismissed.

1960: March 8; 1960: April 11.

Present: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright,
Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.

Criminal law—Habeas corpus—Conspiracy to traffic in
drugs—Accused held in penitentiary under certificate of sentence issued by
convicting Court—Whether sufficient authority for detention of accused—New
Criminal Code coming into force during alleged period of offence— Whether
sentence should be under new Code—The Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1962, c. 259, s. 67—The
Penitentiaries Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 206, ss. 49(1), 51—The General Sessions
Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 158, s. 2 —The Criminal Code , 1958-54 (Can.) c. 51, ss.
2(10), 408(l)(d), 413.

The accused was convicted in the Court of General Session of
the Peace for the County of York of conspiracy to traffic in drugs and was
sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, pursuant to s. 408(1) (d) of the new
Criminal Code , which came into force during the period of time within
which the offence was alleged to have been committed. He has been detained in a
penitentiary by the authority of a Calendar of Sentences under the seal of the
Court of General Sessions of the Peace. His appeal from the conviction was
dismissed and leave to appeal to this Court was refused. He then moved for a
writ of habeas corpus which was refused by a judge of this Court. His
appeal from the sentence having been dismissed by the Court of Appeal and leave
refused by this Court, he now appeals from the refusal of the writ.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed; the application
for a writ of habeas corpus was rightly dismissed.

Per Kerwin C.J.: The Calendar was a certificate regular
on its face that the accused had been convicted by a Court of competent
criminal jurisdiction and, therefore, it was impossible to go behind it on an
application for habeas corpus. There was no substance in the objection
that the description of the offence was insufficient; nor did it make any
difference that the Court of General Sessions of the Peace was not a superior
court of criminal jurisdiction.

As to the argument that the sentencing provisions of the
former Code should have been applied, there was nothing to indicate that the
evidence before the jury did not disclose that the conspiracy commenced after
April 1, 1955. The Court of Appeal having heard and dismissed an appeal as to
sentence, any judge in Ontario would be bound by that decision and, therefore,
any judge of this Court, having by virtue of s. 57 of the Supreme Court Act concurrent
jurisdiction with the Court or judges of Ontario, would be similarly bound.
There was now no justification for the idea that, if a person is refused a writ
of habeas corpus by one judge, he may go to each judge in succession to
renew his application.

Per Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.: The
question sought to be determined by the accused—the maximum penalty for the
offence of which he was convicted—would require consideration of the evidence
at trial, and would be tantamount to converting the

[Page 432]

writ into a writ of error or an appeal. The functions of such
a writ do not extend beyond an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the Court by
which process the subject is held in custody and into the validity of the
process upon its face.

The accused was convicted and sentenced by a Court of
competent jurisdiction, the Calendar was a certificate regular on its face, and
the application for the writ was rightly dismissed.

Per Locke and Cartwright JJ.: What was sought by the
accused was an adjudication on the question as to what was the maximum penalty
for the offence of which he was convicted. That was a point which the trial
judge had jurisdiction to decide, and which could be further pursued on appeal.
The writ of habeas corpus is not a writ of course and may be refused
where an alternative remedy by which the validity of the detention can be
determined is available. So long as the sentence of a competent Court stands
unreversed, it is a legal justification for the imprisonment. On the facts of
this case, the writ was rightly refused, and a fortiori it should be
refused now as the very question which the accused seeks to have decided was res
judicata between the parties.

APPEAL from a judgment of Martland J. of the Supreme
Court of Canada1, refusing a writ of habeas corpus. Appeal
dismissed.

G. B. Langille, for the appellant.

D.H.W. Henry, Q.C., and L. E. Levy, for
the respondent.

The Chief Justice:—Jack
Goldhar applied to Martland J. under s. 57 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C
1952, c. 259, for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. That section
reads as follows:

57.(1) Every judge of the Court, except in matters arising
out of any claim for extradition under any treaty, has concurrent jurisdiction
with the courts or judges of the several provinces, to issue the writ of habeas
corpus ad subjiciendum, for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of
commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.

(2) If the judge refuses the writ or remands the prisoner,
an appeal lies to the Court.

The writ was refused2 and under the authority
conferred by subs. (2) Goldhar appealed to the Court.

On April 27, 1956, Goldhar had been found guilty in the
Court of General Sessions of the Peace for the County of York in the Province
of Ontario under the first count of an indictment charging that he and others
at the City of

[Page 433]

Toronto, in the County of York and elsewhere in the Province
of Ontario, between the fifteenth day of March and the sixth day of August in
the year 1955, unlawfully did conspire together, the one with the other or
others of them and persons unknown, to commit the indictable offence of having
in their possession a drug, to wit., diacetyl-morphine, for the purpose of
trafficking, an indictable offence under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, contrary
to the Criminal Code . On May 4, 1956, he was sentenced by the judge
presiding in the General Sessions of the Peace, His Honour Judge Macdonell, to
twelve years imprisonment in the Kingston Penitentiary. Presumably shortly
thereafter he was taken to the institution where he is now incarcerated.

A search was made by a solicitor on behalf of the appellant
in the Records Office of the Kingston Penitentiary and there was produced to
him a Calendar of Sentences,—Sessions—as being the authority under which the
appellant was detained. That calendar was a certificate, dated May 4, 1956,
signed by the Deputy Clerk of the Peace, York, and under the seal of the Court
of General Sessions of the Peace in and for the County of York, certifying that
the name of the prisoner was ""Goldhar, Jack"", that the offence was
""conspiracy (to have in possession a drug for the purpose of
trafficking)"", that the date of sentence was ""4th May, 1956"" and
that the sentence was ""Twelve years in the Kingston Penitentiary"".
Attached to the solicitor's affidavit was a copy of the Calendar of Sentences
and a copy of the indictment with the endorsement of the conviction and
sentence on the back. The affidavit stated that the deponent had been advised
by a stenographer in the Records Office of the penitentiary that the Calendar
is the only document received at such office ""when a person is convicted
by a Judge at a Court of General Sessions of the Peace or by a Judge at a
County Court""; and that, ""it is only in the situation where a
conviction is registered by a magistrate or the Supreme Court that Form 18 of
the forms set out in the Criminal Code  is used as the Warrant of
Committal to Kingston Penitentiary"". Furthermore, he was advised that the
Calendar of Sentences,—Sessions was the only authority by which Goldhar was
detained in custody.

[Page 434]

An appeal by Goldhar to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from
his conviction was dismissed and an application for leave to appeal from that
dismissal to this Court was refused. He thereupon launched the motion for a
writ of habeas corpus, which was heard in October and November 1958, and
his appeal from the order of Martland J. came on for hearing in June 1959. It
then appearing that he had not applied to the Court of Appeal for Ontario for
leave to appeal from his sentence, the appeal before us was adjourned in order
to permit him to seek such leave, with permission to renew his appeal to this
Court after the disposition of his application to the Court of Appeal. That
Court granted him leave to appeal from his conviction restricted to the ground:

Whether Section 408(l)(d) of Criminal Code , 1953-54, Ch. 51
is applicable to the conspiracy committed since, if it is not, the maximum
sentence for a conspiracy not specifically named in Criminal Code . R.S.C. 1927,
Ch. 36 is found under Section 573 of said statute, namely seven years.

When, pursuant to such leave, his appeal from sentence
was heard by the Court of Appeal, it was dismissed. An application by him to
appeal to this Court3 from that dismissal was refused.
Thereupon, pursuant to the leave reserved to him, he renewed his appeal before
us from the order of Martland J. and that appeal was heard on March 7 and 8 of this
year.

Sections 49(1) and 51 of the Penitentiaries Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 206 enact:

49. (1) The sheriff or deputy sheriff of any county or
district, or any bailiff, constable, or other officer, or other person, by his
direction or by the direction of a court, or any officer appointed by the
Governor in Council and attached to the staff of a penitentiary for that
purpose, may convey to the penitentiary named in the sentence, any convict
sentenced or liable to be imprisoned therein, and shall deliver him to the
warden thereof, without any further warrant than a copy of the sentence taken
from the minutes of the court before which the convict was tried, and certified
by a judge or by the clerk or acting clerk of such court.

51. The warden shall receive into the penitentiary every
convict legally certified to him as sentenced to imprisonment therein, unless
certified by the surgeon of the penitentiary to be suffering from a dangerously
infectious or contagious disease, and shall there detain him, subject to the
rules, regulations and discipline thereof, until the term for which he has been
sentenced is completed, or until he is otherwise legally discharged, but a
convict, if certified by the surgeon to be suffering in

[Page 435]

manner aforesaid, may remain and be kept in his former
custody until his condition in the opinion of the surgeon justifies withdrawal
of the certificate.

By s. 2 of The General Sessions Act, R.S.O.
1950, c. 158, it is provided:

2. The courts of general sessions of the peace shall have jurisdiction
to try all criminal offences except homicide, and the offences mentioned in
section 583  of the Criminal Code  (Canada).

Section 583  referred to was in the old Criminal
Code . By s. 2(10) of the new Criminal Code , 1953-54, c. 51, which
came into force April 1, 1955,

""court of criminal jurisdiction"" means

(a) a court of general or
quarter sessions of the peace, when presided over by a superior court judge or
a county or district court judge,
............................................................................................

and by s. 413 of the new Code

413. (1) Every superior court of criminal jurisdiction has
jurisdiction to try any indictable offence.

(2) Every court of criminal jurisdiction has jurisdiction to
try an indictable offence other than
...........................................................................................
(Certain offences which do not include that of which the accused was
convicted.)

The Calendar is a certificate regular on its face that
the appellant was convicted by a court of competent criminal jurisdiction and
therefore it is impossible to go behind it on an application for habeas
corpus; Re Trepanier4; Re Sproule5; In
re Henderson6.

There is no substance in the appellant's objection that the
description of the offence in the Calendar as ""conspiracy (to have in
possession a drug for the purpose of trafficking)"" is insufficient; nor
does it make any difference that the Court of General Sessions of the Peace is
not a superior court of criminal jurisdiction; Rex v. Martin7.

While what has been said is sufficient to dispose of the
appeal, reference might be made to the argument on behalf of the appellant that
as he was found guilty of a charge of having conspired between March 15 and
August 6, 1955, and the new Criminal Code  came into force on April 1,
1955,

[Page 436]

the provisions of the old Code applied and he could not be
sentenced to more than seven years imprisonment, which was the maximum provided
for under the old Code for conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. Under s.
573 of the old Criminal Code  the maximum penalty for conspiracy to
commit an indictable offence was seven years. Under s. 408(1) (d) of
the new Criminal Code  the maximum penalty for conspiracy to commit an
indictable offence (other than conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to bring a
false accusation or conspiracy to defile) is the same as the penalty imposed in
respect of the particular indictable offence regarding the commission of which
there has been a conspiracy. In the case of having in possession a drug for the
purpose of trafficking, the maximum penalty, under s. 4(3) (b) of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, is fourteen years. There is nothing to indicate that
the evidence before the jury did not disclose that the conspiracy commenced
after April 1, 1955, and that therefore the new Code would apply. The Court of
Appeal having heard and dismissed an appeal as to sentence any judge in Ontario
would be bound by that decision and I agree with what was held by Gwynne J. in In
re Boucher8, by Sedgewick J. in In re
Patrick White9 and by Girouard J. in In re
Charles Seeley10 that, therefore, any judge of
this Court, having concurrent jurisdiction with the court or judges of the
Province of Ontario under what is now s. 57 of the Supreme Court Act, would
be similarly bound.

In the Seeley case the order of Girouard J. was
confirmed on appeal on other grounds and Chief Justice Fitzpatrick, speaking
for the Court, referred to the remarks of Lord Herschell in Cox v. Hakes11,
where Lord Herschell stated that it was always open to an applicant for a writ
of habeas corpus, if defeated in one court, at once to renew his
application to another, and that a person detained in custody might thus
proceed from court to court until he obtained his liberty. In Smith v. The
King12, Chief Justice Anglin stated that had
it been competent for the Court to deal with that

[Page 437]

aspect of the case before him, he would have been disposed
to think Mr. Justice Newcombe right as the latter had decided in the same sense
as in the three earlier cases mentioned above. The dissenting opinion of Lament
J. in Smith v. The King refers to Lord Halsbury's statement, at p. 514
of Cox v. Hakes:—""If release was refused a person detained
might—see Ex parte Partington—make a fresh application to every judge or
every court in turn"". Lamont J. also referred to what Lord Herschell had
stated at p. 527 in Cox v. Hakes. Lamont J. also referred to the
decision of the Privy Council in Eshugbayi Eleko v. Government of Nigeria13.
However, the judgments in connection with various applications by Edward
Thomas Hastings show that whatever may have been the position at one time,
there is now no justification for the idea that, if a person is refused a writ
of habeas corpus by one judge, he may go to each judge in succession to
renew his application.

From the report in In re Hastings14, it
appears that Hastings had been convicted on each count of an indictment
containing five counts. The warrant of commitment sent to the Governor of
Walton Prison, Liverpool, where the applicant was detained, stated:

Whereas ............................................. Edward
Thomas Hastings is and stands covicted of larceny, false pretences and
fraudulent conversion. It is therefore ordered and adjudged by this court that
(he) be sent for corrective training of four years.

The applicant applied for leave to appeal against the
convictions and leave was given in respect of the first and two of the other
counts. The Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the conviction on the first count
and the appeal in relation to the two other counts was dismissed. Pearson J. in
giving the judgment of the Court stated that the applicant had been
""sentenced on each count concurrently"", that although leave to appeal
against sentence had not been asked for, the sentence was, in the view of the
Court, reasonable and ""the conviction on the first ground is quashed ……
and there will be no alteration of sentence"". The report in (1958) 1
W.L.R. is the report of an application for a writ of habeas corpus to
the Queen's Bench Division on the

[Page 438]

ground that his detention was illegal, the main
argument being that no sentence of the Court was ever passed upon him. That
application was denied. Hastings thereupon appealed to the Court of Appeal who refused
to entertain the application on the ground that being a criminal cause or
matter that Court had no jurisdiction; (The Times, July 29, 1958.).

The next step was an application for a writ of habeas
corpus to the Queen's Bench Division differently constituted in In re
Hastings (No. 2)15. Lord Parker, speaking for himself and
Hilbery and Diplock JJ., referred to the statement of Lord Esher when Cox v.
Hakes was before the Court of Appeal under the title Ex parte Cox16,
that ""it is not correct to say that under the old system there could
be an application to all the judges in succession"". He then remarked that
none of Their Lordships in the House of Lords dissented from Lord Esher's
statement, unless it be Lord Halsbury in the passage quoted. It was pointed out
that the decision in the Eleko case had remained unquestioned except in
an Irish case, but it was held that the applicant, having already once been
heard by a Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division, is not entitled to
be heard again by another Divisional Court of the same Division.

The next step appears in In re Hastings (No. 3)17,
where a Divisional Court of the Chancery Division held that an applicant for a
writ of habeas corpus in a criminal cause or matter, who had once been
heard by a Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division, cannot be heard
again by a Divisional Court of the Chancery Division. Finally, to complete the
picture, an appeal from this decision to the Court of Appeal in In re
Hastings (No. 3)18 was dismissed on the ground that no
appeal lay to the Court of Appeal.

In fact, all reason is consonant with the opposite rule and
it is unthinkable that after the Court of Appeal for Ontario has decided a
point against the accused on the latter's appeal as to sentence, any judge in
that province would decide differently on an application for a writ of habeas
corpus. Under s. 57 of the Supreme Court Act every

[Page 439]

judge of this Court has merely concurrent jurisdiction with
the courts or judges of Ontario to issue a writ of habeas corpus and
upon an appeal to the Court the latter may make only that order which the
single judge would have had power to make.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.
was delivered by

Fauteux J.:—The
appellant appeals from an order of Martland J. refusing his application for a
writ of habeas corpus ad subjudiciendum.

The question, which counsel for the appellant admittedly
sought to be determined by way of habeas corpus proceedings, is stated
in the reasons for judgment of other members of the Court. In my view, it is
one which would require the consideration of the evidence at trial and which,
in this particular case, extends beyond the scope of matters to be inquired
under a similar process. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to convert the
writ of habeas corpus into a writ of error or an appeal and to confer,
upon every one having authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus, an
appellate jurisdiction over the orders and judgments of even the highest
Courts. It is well settled that the functions of such a writ do not extend
beyond an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the Court by which process the
subject is held in custody and into the validity of the process upon its face.

I agree with the view that the appellant has been convicted
and sentenced by a Court of competent jurisdiction, that the Calendar is a
certificate regular on its face that the appellant has been so convicted and
sentenced and that, with the material before him, Martland J. rightly dismissed
the application for a writ of habeas corpus.

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by

Cartwright J.:—This
is an appeal from an order of Martland J. made on November 20, 1958, refusing
the appellant's application for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum19.

[Page 440]

The relevant facts and the history of the proceedings are
set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.

I do not find it necessary to deal with all the points which
were so fully and ably argued before us. Assuming, contrary to the argument of
counsel for the respondent, that Martland J. had jurisdiction to entertain the
application I am of opinion that he was right to refuse the writ.

Before Martland J. and on the argument of this appeal
counsel agreed that, if any objection could have been made successfully to the
adequacy of the document held by the warden of the Penitentiary as authority
for detaining the appellant, it would have been in order for the warden to
obtain a proper minute or warrant of committal setting out the offence of which
the appellant was convicted in the terms of the indictment. Counsel for the
appellant made it plain that what he sought before Martland J. and before us
was an adjudication on the question whether the maximum penalty for the offence
of which the appellant was convicted was seven years or fourteen years in view
of the circumstance that the indictment alleged a conspiracy between March 15
and August 6 in the year 1955, and if the offence were committed before April
1, 1955, the maximum penalty was seven years while if it were committed after
that date the maximum was fourteen years. In my opinion this is a difficult
question of law; and my brother Fauteux, in giving the judgment of the majority
of the Court in Goldhar v. The Queen20, delivered on
November 30, 1959, described it as ""undoubtedly one of substance"".

It was, however, a point which the learned Judge who
presided at the trial of the appellant in the Court of General Sessions of the
Peace had jurisdiction to decide, and if in the view of the appellant he erred
in law in reaching his decision the proper course for the appellant to pursue
was to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

The writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum is a writ
of right and is issued ex debito justitiae, upon it being shown that
there is ground for believing that the applicant is unlawfully held in custody,
so that the Court may inquire into the cause of his imprisonment and in a
proper case order his immediate release; but it is not a writ of course

[Page 441]

and may be refused where an alternative remedy by which the
validity of the detention can be determined is available to the applicant. In Ex
part Corke21, Lord Goddard, delivering the
judgment of the Queen's Bench Division in which Slade J. concurred, said that habeas
corpus is not a means of appeal where an accused has been convicted and
sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction. The remedy in such a case is by
way of appeal; for so long as it stands unreversed the sentence of a competent
court is a legal justification for imprisoning the applicant.

I wish to reserve my opinion as to whether the writ is
available if the warrant of committal shows on its face that the sentence was
one not permitted by law.

When the matter came before Martland J. it appeared from the
material that the appellant had been convicted and sentenced by a court of
criminal jurisdiction having jurisdiction to try the appellant on the charge of
which he was convicted, that an appeal against the conviction had been taken
and dismissed and that no appeal had been taken against the sentence imposed.
On this state of the record, in my view, Martland J. was right in refusing the
writ, for the judgment of His Honour Judge Macdonell unless set aside by the
Court of Appeal furnished a sufficient ground for holding the applicant in
custody.

A fortiori, we should refuse the writ now that the
sentence imposed by His Honour has been affirmed by a judgment of the Court of
Appeal and an application for leave to appeal to this Court from that judgment
has been refused by this Court. The very question which the applicant seeks to
have decided on this application is res judicata between the parties. In
giving the judgment of the Privy Council in Sambasivam v. Public Prosecutor
Federation of Malaya22, Lord MacDermott said:

The maxim ""Res judicata pro veritate accipitur""
is no less applicable to
criminal than to civil proceedings.

The question of the legality of the sentence imposed on the
applicant has been conclusively determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
and cannot be re-opened; this

[Page 442]

results not from the application of the principle of stare
decisis but from the operation of the rule stated in the maxim quoted
above, ""Res judicata pro veritate accipitur"".

Since the question of the legality of the sentence imposed
on the appellant has become res judicata nothing would be gained by
endeavouring to form an opinion as to how it should have been answered had it
remained open; I have already said that it appears to me to be one of
difficulty and I venture to express my regret that we have not the benefit of
knowing the reasons which brought the Court of Appeal to the conclusion at
which it arrived.

I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by the Chief
Justice.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION

Criminal law—Lotteries—Scheme whereby ticket purchaser
most closely estimating value of house would receive same as prize—Retention of
trust company to assist in conduct of scheme-operators deposited

[Page 415]

sufficient sum to guarantee prize awarded even if only
one ticket sold—whether illegal lottery under s. 179(1)  (e) of the Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51.

The appellants conducted a scheme whereby any person buying a
ticket for $1 would be entitled to submit an estimation of the value of a house
and its contents, and the closest estimator would receive the house with its
contents and the land on which the house would be transported. A trust company,
engaged to assist in the conduct of the scheme, required, as a condition for
providing its services, that the operators deposit a sum sufficient to assure
payment for the house and to guarantee that the house would be awarded to the
winner of the contest. The accused were convicted of conducting a scheme under
s. 179(1)  (e) of the Criminal Code . The conviction was affirmed
by a majority in the Court of Appeal.

Held: The appeals should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: Under s. 179(1) (e)
of the Code, the element of chance is not essential. Consequently, following
the decision of Roe. v. The King [1949] S.C.R. 652, the offence was
committed even if skill had been the only factor that allowed the winner to
determine the value of the house, since it was clear that the purchasers of
tickets became entitled under the scheme to receive from the operators a larger
sum than the amount paid because others had also paid money under the same
scheme. The fact that the winner was to receive a house and not a ""larger
sum of money"" or ""amount of valuable security"" did not prevent
the application of the section, since the words ""valuable security""
are defined in s. 2(42) of the Code as including ""a document of title to
lands or goods wheresoever situate"".

The argument that the house was to be conveyed, not by the
promoters, but by the trust company, could not be accepted. Everything done by
the trust company was done on behalf of the promoters.

Per Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The
submission that by depositing a sufficient sum of money with the trust company,
the prize would be awarded irrespective of whether or not any other tickets had
been sold, could not be entertained. What constitutes the offence under s.
179(1)  (e) is the conducting of a scheme by which a participant will
receive, as in this case, a larger amount of valuable security than he paid
because other persons have contributed to the scheme. The deposit with the
trust company was only made by reasons of the fact that it was part of a scheme
by which contestants would pay money to enter the contest. This brought the
case squarely under the prohibition of the section.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1,
affirming the appellants' convictions under s. 179(1)  (e) of the Criminal
Code . Appeals dismissed.

J. W. McClung, for the appellants.

H. J. Wilson, Q.C., and J. W.
Anderson, for the respondent.

[Page 416]

The judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau J.:—Both
appellants were charged under ss. 179(1)  (a) and 179(1)  (e) of
the Criminal Code  of Canada.

Under s. 179(1) (a) the charges read as follows:

THE INFORMANT SAYS THAT he has reasonable and probable
grounds to believe and does believe that

1959, and the 27th day of June A.D. 1959, at the City of Edmonton, Province of
Alberta, did unlawfully advertise a scheme, to wit: the Dream Home Contest, for
the purpose of disposing of property, to wit: the Fekete Dream Home, to be
disposed of by a mode of chance, contrary to the provisions of Section 179(1)  (a)
of the Criminal Code .

disposing of property, to wit: The Fekete Dream Home, to be disposed of by a
mode of chance. Contrary to the provisions of Section 179(1)  (a) of the

Alberta, did unlawfully conduct a scheme by which a person upon payment of a sum
of money shall become entitled under the scheme to receive from the said
Company a larger amount of valuable security than the amount paid by reason of
the fact that other persons have paid a sum of money under the scheme. Contrary
to the provisions of Section

179(1) (e) of the Criminal Code .

THE

between the 1st day of April A.D. 1959, and the 27th day of

conduct a scheme by which any person upon payment of a sum of money shall
become entitled under the scheme to receive from the person conducting the
scheme, or any other person, a larger amount of valuable security than the
amount paid by reason of the fact that other persons have paid a sum of money
under the scheme. Contrary to the provisions of Section 179(1)  (e) of
the Criminal Code .

[Page 417]

The learned magistrate dismissed both charges under 179(1) (a)
but convicted both defendants under 179(1) (e).

His reasons for dismissing the charges under 179(1) (a)
were that under that section, a mixed element of chance and skill entered
into the estimates made by those who purchased tickets, while the statutes in
order to apply required exclusively a chance element. The magistrate
based his opinion on the unanimous judgment rendered by this Court in, Roe
v. The King2
where that precise point was definitively settled.

The Crown did not appeal this part of the judgment to the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and it is therefore
unnecessary to deal with it. But. the magistrate convicted both accused on the
charge of violating section 179(1)  (e), and the Appellate Division3 confirmed his finding, Mr.
Justice Johnson dissenting.

We have now to deal only with the appeals of Dream Home
Contests (Edmonton) Limited and Ronald A. Hodges, both convicted under s. 179(1) 
(e).

Section 179(1)  (e) reads:

179. (1) Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years who

(e) conducts, manages or
is a party to any. scheme, contrivance or operation of any kind by which any
person, upon payment of any sum of money, or the giving of any valuable
security, or by obligating himself to pay any sum of money or give any valuable
security, shall become entitled under the scheme, contrivance or operation, to
receive from the person conducting or managing the scheme, contrivance or
operation, or any other person, a larger sum of money or amount of valuable
security than the sum or amount paid or given, or to be paid or given, by
reason of the fact that other persons have paid or given, or obligated
themselves to pay or give any sum of money or valuable security under the
scheme, contrivance or operation.

The scheme as engineered was as follows:—The appellants
built a house called a ""Dream Home"" that was on display to the public
on a lot situate at 117th Street and Jasper Avenue in Edmonton, Alberta. The
accused issued a brochure showing who built the Home and giving the names of
the 17 suppliers of materials and subcontractors. The contestants eligible to
participate in the contest had to purchase a one dollar ticket, and were
required to esti-

[Page 418]

mate the total retail value of this Dream Home with attached
garage, including its furnishings, appliances, fixtures and appointments
therein contained.

It was a condition of the contest that the contestant who
most closely estimated the total retail value of the Dream Home, would be
awarded the Home, and that it would be conveyed by the company to a permanent
lot, in the subdivision of Lynnwood in the Townsite of Jasper Place. The retail
value of the Dream Home was to be determined by the persons, firms or
corporations supplying products and services in connection with the
construction, furnishing, equipping and completing the Home as displayed.

The sealed estimates of retail value by those who had
purchased tickets, were held ""In Trust"" by the Northwest Trust
Company Limited until the close of the contest, which was December 30, 1959, at
which time a committee appointed by the Trust company was to open the sealed
estimates, and the contestant who most closely estimated the retail value of
the Home would be the contest winner. Some 400,000 tickets were printed of
which a substantial number were sold, and Home Contests (Edmonton) Limited and
the other defendant Hodges, who is the main shareholder and manager of the said
company, deposited with the Trust company $31,000 to be drawn against, as the
building of the Home progressed.

I am quite satisfied that in order to determine the retail
value of this Dream Home, much more than a mere element of chance was
necessary. It was essential for the winner to have at least a fair knowledge of
construction, of cost of materials, etc. etc., and skill was obviously a
much more important factor than chance in determining the retail value
of the Home.

But the law as it exists today is the same as that
considered in Roe v. The King, supra. In that case, Roe had been
prosecuted under the first part of s. 236(c) as it then existed, and
secondly, under the second part of the same section added to the Criminal
Code  in 1935 (25-26 Geo. V, ch. 56, s. 3). Under the new Code of 1955, the
corresponding sections are 179(1) (d) and 179(1) (e).

[Page 419]

In the Roe case it was held that the charge under the
first part of the old s. 236(c) ought to be dismissed. It was found that
there was a mixed element of skill and chance and that, therefore, there could
be no offence.

But the Court held that under the second part of the former
s. 236(c), now 179(1) (e), there is no reference to chance or to
a mixed element of chance and skill, and that the receiving of money was not
subordinated to either of these elements. Roe was found guilty because a larger
sum of money was paid to the winner, by reason of the fact that other persons
had paid money under the scheme.

In the present case, it seems clear to me that the
purchasers of tickets who pay money, may become entitled under the scheme as
they do, to receive from the person managing the operation, a larger sum than
the amount paid, because others have also paid money under the same scheme. A
ticket purchaser who happens to be the winner, as a result of his skilful
guessing, even if the element of chance is entirely absent, receives a larger
sum of money than the amount he has paid, because some others who have
purchased tickets have also paid money under the same scheme. This is the gist
of the offence. It may not be immoral but it is illegal.

In s. 179(1) (a) the element of chance is essential,
but it is not in 179(1) (e). In Roe v. The King this Court has
said:

This part of s. 236(c) now 179(1) (e) which
stands alone, does not refer to chance, or to mixed chance and skill. The
receiving of money is not subordinated to any of these elements. The larger sum
of money is paid to the winner by reason of the fact that other persons have
paid money under this scheme.

I think that this Court is bound by its own decision in the Roe
case cited supra, and that the offence is committed, even if skill
has been the only factor that allowed the winner to determine the retail value
of the Dream Home.

It has been suggested that s. 179(1) (e) does not
apply, because the winner here does not receive as contemplated by the Act a
""larger sum of money"" or ""amount of valuable security"" than
the sum or amount paid or given. In the present case, the winner was to receive
a house.

[Page 420]

This argument cannot stand in view of the fact that the
words ""valuable security"" are defined in s. 2, subs. 42 of the Criminal
Code , and include ""a document of title to lands or goods wheresoever
situate.""

It has also been argued that the house was to be conveyed to
the winner, not by the promoters of the scheme, but by the Trust company. I am
satisfied that everything done by the Trust company was done on behalf of the
promoters and that this argument cannot be accepted. As to the appellants'
submission that by paying $31,000 to the Trust company, they assured the award
of the prize to the successful estimator, irrespective of whether or not any
tickets had been sold, I agree with what has been said by my brother Martland.

Both appeals should be dismissed.

The judgment of Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was
delivered by

Martland J.:—The
appellant company is incorporated under the laws of the Province of Alberta.
The appellant, Hodges, was a signatory of its Memorandum of Association and is
its majority shareholder. In mid 1959, the appellant company caused to be
erected a house, which was fully furnished, and which was on display at 117th
Street and Jasper Avenue, in the City of Edmonton.

The appellant company advertised extensively a contest,
which was to continue until the end of the year 1959, under the terms of which
the house and its contents would be awarded to the contestant who submitted the
closest estimate of the actual retail value of the house, including furnishings
and fixtures. Entry into the contest could be effected by the purchase of
tickets sold at $1 each. These tickets contained an estimate form and an entry
blank. The appellant company had 400,000 tickets printed. At the time of the
trial, some 1,400 had been sold. The winner of the contest would be entitled to
receive, in addition to the house and its contents, a lot in the subdivision of
Lynwood, in the townsite of Jasper Place, to which the house and its contents
would be moved by the appellant company after completion of the contest.

[Page 421]

Arrangements were made by the appellant
company to have the tickets widely distributed for sale in Edmonton and in
Northern Alberta, by having sales effected through various community leagues
and branches of the Canadian Legion.

The appellants approached Northwest Trust Company which
agreed to receive sealed tenders from the contractors and suppliers in
connection with the house which, taken together, would establish its total
retail value. The trust company also agreed to receive, record, and dispose of
the tickets to the ticket vendors upon the instructions of the appellant
company. It also received the moneys derived from the sale of tickets, part of
which was to be held by it in trust for the vendors of the tickets, and the
balance in trust for the appellant company.

As a condition of providing these services, the trust
company required the deposit by the appellant company of $31,000 to assure
payment of certain expenditures, including the payment for the house. This was
to ensure that the house would be awarded to the winner of the contest. Title
to the house, to its contents, and to the lot, was taken in trust by the trust
company.

The arrangements for the printing and distribution of the
tickets, the arrangements with the trust company, and, generally, most of the arrangements
in respect of the con- test, were effected for the appellant company by the
appellant Hodges.

Both the appellants were charged under paras. (a) and
(e) of subs. (1) of s. 179  of the Criminal Code . The charges
under para. (a) were dismissed, but both appellants were
convicted by the learned magistrate under para. (e). From these
convictions, both appellants appealed, unsuccessfully, to the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta,4
Mr. Justice Johnson dissenting. The present appeal relates solely to the
convictions under para. (e), which provides as follows:

179. (1) Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years who

* * *

(e) conducts, manages or is a party to any scheme,
contrivance or operation of any kind by which any person, upon payment of any
sum of money, or the giving of any valuable security, or by

[Page 422]

obligating himself to pay any sum of money or give any
valuable security, shall become entitled under the scheme, contrivance or
operation, to receive from the person conducting or managing the scheme,
contrivance or operation, or any other person, a larger sum of money or amount
of valuable security than the sum or amount paid or given, or to be paid or
given, by reason of the fact that other persons have paid or given, or
obligated themselves to pay or give any sum of money or valuable security under
the scheme, contrivance or operation;

The sole contention of each of the appellants is that no
offence was shown because the winning estimator would not become entitled to a
larger amount of valuable security because other persons had paid or obliged
themselves to pay any sum of money. It was argued that the awarding of the
prize was wholly exclusive of the participation in the contest of other
unsuccessful estimators. The appellant's submission was that, by paying the
$31,000 to the trust company, the appellant company had assured the award of
the prize to the successful estimator, who would receive such prize
irrespective of whether or not any other tickets had been sold.

The appellants seek to distinguish the decision of this
Court in Roe v. The King,5 because
of the fact that, in that case, which involved a contest to estimate the time
for a barrel to float down the Red River from the international boundary to
Winnipeg, the appellant had signed an admission that the winning estimators
would receive a larger sum of money that that paid for their tickets because
other non-winning estimators had contributed to the scheme. In the present case
it is contended that the situation is different because the winning of the
prize did not depend upon the sale of tickets to non-winning estimators.

A similar argument was made on behalf of the appellant in Rex
v. Blain,6 a
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan. In that case the contest
involved the estimating of the actual time when the ice in the Saskatchewan
River at Prince Albert would break up. Tickets were sold at fifty cents per
ticket but the prize of $1,000 was donated by the Kinsmen Club of Prince
Albert, who also paid the cost of operating the scheme, thus leaving the proceeds
from the sale of the tickets available for charitable purposes.

[Page 423]

The accused, Blain, was the individual who had managed the
scheme.

The conviction of the appellant was sustained by the Court
of Appeal. In his judgment, at p. 151, Chief Justice Martin referred to the
admission made by the appellant in the Roe case, and to the statement by
Taschereau J. at p. 657 in that case, that the admission ""brings the case
within the prohibition of the statute"".

Chief Justice Martin then goes on to say, and, I think,
correctly:

This statement was not intended to mean that the only scheme
which falls within the second part of sec. 236(1) (c) (the equivalent of
sec. 179(1) (e) of the present Criminal Code ) is one in which the larger
sum comes from the proceeds of the sale of tickets to non-winning estimators.
Moreover, the language of the section indicates that the prize need not come
from moneys contributed by a limited class of persons. The larger sum of money
may come from the person managing the scheme ""or any other person"" by
reason of the fact that ""other persons have paid or given … any sum of
money … under such scheme"".

It seems to me that what constitutes the offence defined in
s. 179(1) (e) is the conducting of a scheme and the question to be determined,
in this case, is whether, under the scheme, a participant will receive a larger
amount of valuable security than he paid because other persons have contributed
to the scheme. The deposit of the $31,000 with the trust company was a part of
an overall scheme conducted by the appellants. That scheme, when examined as a
whole, in my view, clearly contemplated, at its inception and throughout, that
the award by the appellant company of the prize to the winning estimator would
be made at the conclusion of the contest by reason of the payments for tickets
of all the other non-winning contestants. The deposit of the funds with the
trust company was only made by the appellant company by reason of the fact that
it was a part of a scheme by which contestants would pay money to enter the
contest. As Macdonald J. A. said, in his judgment in the Appellate Division:

The property to be won would be paid for initially by money
which came from the appellants, according to the arrangement made with the
trust company. But it seems to me there can be no doubt that under the scheme
in question, the appellants sought not only to recoup themselves for their
initial outlay but also to make a substantial margin of profit, depending upon
the number of tickets sold. The number of tickets seized by the police
demonstrates that many tickets had been sold to the public, so at the time of
such seizure the scheme was well under way. It seems

[Page 424]

to me that it has been proved beyond any reasonable doubt
that the winner would be entitled to receive from the appellant company ""a
larger … amount of valuable security than the sum paid"" by him ""by reason
of the fact that other persons have paid … any sum of money under the
scheme"", namely, by the purchase of tickets. The facts proved in evidence
beyond any reasonable doubt, in my view, bring the case squarely under the
prohibition of the statute.

In my opinion, therefore, the appeals of both the appellants
should be dismissed.

Appeals dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Rape—Evidence of complaint—Whether
admissible—Person to whom complaint made not called as witness—Whether only
bare fact of complaint admissible and not particulars of it.

The accused were convicted by a jury on a
charge of rape. The only evidence at the trial of any complaint having been
made was given by the victim. The person to whom she allegedly complained could
not be traced and consequently was not called as a witness in corroboration.
The verdict was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The accused
appealed to this Court on two grounds of law: (1) that the victim’s evidence of
the details of the complaint allegedly made by her should not have been
admitted at trial, and (2) that the jury should not have been charged that they
might conclude from her evidence that her conduct had been consistent
throughout. It was conceded by counsel for the accused that the validity of the
second ground depended upon the validity of the first.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The submission that in the absence of any
evidence from the person to whom the complaint was allegedly made, the evidence
of the victim as to the fact of the complaint was inadmissible, was
ill-founded. The principle upon which such a complaint, not made on oath, nor
in the presence of the accused, nor, as in this case, forming part of the res
gestae, is admissible in a case of this nature, is one of necessity. It is
presumed that the victim will complain at the first reasonable opportunity and,
consequently, that her silence might naturally be taken as a virtual
self-contradiction of her story. The victim should therefore be entitled to
rebut, by her own evidence of complaint, the presumption which would attach to
her silence, and that right should not be denied for the sole reason that the
person to whom the alleged complaint was made was untraceable. There was no
rule, either statutory or of other kind, that such evidence must itself be
confirmed or corroborated.

The submission that the evidence of complaint
should be limited to the fact that a complaint was made without giving any of
the particulars of it, could not be entertained. Furthermore, the victim did
not give particulars in this case.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], affirming, by a
majority decision, a jury’s verdict on a charge of rape. Appeal dismissed.

[Page 401]

C. Dubin, Q.C., for the appellants.

E. Pepper, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—The appellants were convicted by a
jury, in the Supreme Court of Ontario, on a charge of rape. The verdict was
appealed to the Court of Appeal[2] for the
province, and affirmed by a majority decision, Morden J.A. dissenting on two
questions of law which now and pursuant to s. 597(1)  (a) of the Criminal
Code  form the basis of this appeal. As stated in appellants’ factum, these
two grounds are:

1. The learned trial Judge erred in
admitting the prosecutrix’ evidence of the details of the complaint allegedly
made by her.

2. The learned trial Judge erred in
charging the jury that they might conclude from her evidence that her conduct
had been consistent throughout.

For the appreciation and the consideration of
the first ground, it is only necessary, but sufficient, to advert to that phase
of the evidence of the prosecutrix, which is related to the complaint itself
and to the circumstances immediately contemporaneous with it. Having testified
how she had been forcibly conveyed in an automobile to a secluded place and
there become the victim of the appellants, she said that she then crossed
certain fields to reach the highway where she hailed an approaching truck. She
boarded the truck, started to cry and upon the driver’s inquiry as to the cause
of her grief, she then made a complaint. Her evidence, the admissibility of
which is challenged, proceeds as follows:

Q. Now, we will go back to the truck again.
You were in the truck, you said, going towards Toronto?

A. Yes.

Q. Yes. And, having got into the truck, the
truck driver asked you a question?

A. Yes.

Q. What was the question?

A. I was crying, and he asked me what was
wrong.

Q. Yes, and did you tell him?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you say, please?

[Page 402]

A. I told him I was attacked by four boys
and that my girl friend had got away, and that I didn’t know where she was.

Q. Yes. Anything else?

A. He asked me where they were, and I
pointed over to the car. You could see it from the truck.

Q. Yes. You could still see the car?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, was there any more conversation?

A. Yes.

Q. Go ahead.

A. He said that he would drive me back to
London, but first of all I had to give him a kiss before he would.

Q. And did you?

A. No, I never. I got out of the truck.

Q. You got out of the truck?

A. Yes.

While she did give a certain description of the
truck and of its driver, she did not take the license number of the vehicle nor
did she know the driver thereof. In the result, the latter being untraceable,
could not be called as a witness and there was consequently no evidence to
confirm the fact of her complaint to him.

As presented, in the course of the hearing in
this Court, the submission made on behalf of the appellants in support of the
first ground of appeal is twofold. First, it is said that in the absence of any
evidence from the truck driver, the evidence of the prosecutrix as to the fact
of the complaint is inadmissible. It is then submitted that even if such
evidence is admissible, the particulars of the fact complained of cannot be
given in evidence by the prosecutrix as, it is contended, it was in this case.

These two points are really the only ones to be
considered in this appeal; for, as conceded by counsel for the appellants, the
validity of the second ground of appeal, which is related to the address of the
trial Judge to the jury on the effect of the evidence of complaint, is
conditioned upon the validity of the first for either one of the two points
submitted in support of the latter ground.

No case in point could be found by counsel for
the appellants to support the proposition that evidence of fresh complaint by
the prosecutrix is inadmissible in the absence of any evidence from the
recipient of such com-

[Page 403]

plaint. From the following authorities, we were
asked to draw, as did the learned dissenting Judge, inferences in affirmance of
the validity of this submission.

The first is the Lillyman case[3] where both the prosecutrix and the
recipient of her complaint testified as to the fact of the complaint. Our
attention was called particularly to the following excerpt, at page 170 of the
judgment of the Court, delivered by Hawkins J.:

It is necessary, in the first place, to
have a clear understanding as to the principles upon which evidence of such a
complaint, not on oath, nor made in the presence of the prisoner, nor forming
part of the res gestae, can be admitted. It clearly is not admissible as
evidence of the facts complained of: those facts must therefore be established,
if at all, upon oath by the prosecutrix or other credible witness, and,
strictly speaking, evidence of them ought to be given before evidence of the
complaint is admitted. The complaint can only be used as evidence of the
consistency of the conduct of the prosecutrix with the story told by her in the
witness-box, and as being inconsistent with her consent to that of which she
complains.

It was suggested that when speaking of the
evidence of complaint, Hawkins J. was referring, not to the prosecutrix’
evidence, but to the evidence of the person to whom she complained. With
deference to the dissenting Judge, I am unable to agree with this
interpretation. In the consideration of this and the other cases referred to,
one is reminded of the two observations made by the Earl of Halsbury L.C. in Quinn
v. Leathern[4]:

…one is…that every judgment must be read as
applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the
generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be
expositions of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular
facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. The other is that
a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that
it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it.

We were then referred to a group of decisions: Rex
v. Walker[5]; R.
v. Megson[6]; R.
v. Guttridge et al.[7]; R.
v. Nicholas[8] and R.
v. Wallwork[9]. In all
of these cases, the prosecutrix did not give evidence, and because of this
fact, evidence of the recipient of the complaint as to the fact

[Page 404]

or the particulars of the outrage complained of
was rejected. Reference was also made to Rex v. Osborne[10]; Rex. v. Lovell[11]; Thomas v. The Queen[12]; Rex v. Washington[13] and Rex v. Lebrun[14], where comments are made with respect to
the confirmatory or corroborative nature of the evidence of the recipient of
the complaint. While the testimony of the recipient of a complaint may be
confirmatory or corroborative of the testimony of the prosecutrix as to the fact
and the particulars of the complaint made by her, it does not follow that the
admissibility of the evidence of the prosecutrix, as to these matters, is
conditioned upon the corroboration or confirmation by the recipient. The
comments made in these cases are of no assistance and, in my view, beyond the
point here to be decided.

Finally, we were referred to Phipson On
Evidence, 9th ed., at page 133, where it is said that:

The complaint should be proved by calling
both the prosecutrix herself and the person to whom it was made.

The authorities relied on by Phipson for this
statement do not, as it was ultimately conceded at the hearing, on behalf of
the appellants, support the same.

Counsel for the appellants properly called our
attention to two cases where the validity of his first submission is negatived.
One is R. v. Eyre[15]. The
other is R. v. Ball[16], where
Coady J.A. delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, said:

The evidence of the complainant as to the
complaint made by her would be admissible in evidence, it seems to me, even if
the party to whom the complaint was made was not called as a witness. The
failure to call the party as a witness, or if called, to confirm what was said
by the complainant, goes to the weight to be attached to the complainant’s
evidence.

With this statement of the law and for the
reasons hereafter given, I am in complete agreement.

The argument underlying appellants’ proposition
is that by adding to her recital of the outrage, the fact that she complained
about it, the prosecutrix confirms her own

[Page 405]

story and enhances her credibility. This, it is
said, can only properly be done, not by her own, but by independent evidence.
The true question, in my view, is not what is the effect of evidence of fresh
complaint, but what is the principle upon which such complaint, not made on
oath, nor in the presence of the accused, nor, as in this case, forming part of
the res gestae, is admissible in a case of the nature of the one here
considered.

The principle is one of necessity. It is founded
on factual presumptions which, in the normal course of events, naturally attach
to the subsequent conduct of the prosecutrix shortly after the occurrence of
the alleged acts of violence. One of these presumptions is that she is expected
to complain upon the first reasonable opportunity, and the other, consequential
thereto, is that if she fails to do so, her silence may naturally be taken as a
virtual self‑contradiction of her story. In Hawkins’ Pleas of the Crown,
quoted by Hawkins J. in the Lillyman case, supra, at page 170, it
is said:

It is a strong, but not a conclusive,
presumption against a woman that she made no complaint in a reasonable time
after the fact.

In Wigmore On Evidence, vol. 4, 3rd ed., p. 218,
reference is made to the history of the evidence of complaint in the case of
rape and, at page 220, it is said:

(b) So, where nothing appears on the
trial as to the making of such a complaint, the jury might naturally assume
that none was made, and counsel for the accused might be entitled to argue upon
that assumption. As a peculiarity, therefore, of this kind of evidence, it is
only just that the prosecution should be allowed to forestall this natural
assumption by showing that the woman was not silent, i.e. that a complaint
was in fact made.

This apparently irregular process of
negativing evidence not yet formally introduced by the opponent is regular
enough in reality, because the impression upon the tribunal would otherwise be
there as if the opponent had really offered evidence of the woman’s silence.
Thus the essence of the process consists in the showing that the woman did not
in fact behave with a silence inconsistent with her present story. The
Courts have fully sanctioned this analysis of the situation.

Thus it appears that by giving evidence of her
conduct shortly after the alleged occurrence, the prosecutrix does not, in a
sense, enhance or confirm her story any more than she does in reciting all that
she did in resistance to the assault, but she rebuts a presumption and, in
doing so,

[Page 406]

adds, for all practical purposes, a virtually
essential complement to her story. In the Lovell case, supra, Lord
Chief Justice Hewart, in reference to that type of evidence, said this, at page
169:

There is a clear distinction between
matters which affect the intrinsic credibility of the witness’s own story when
that story is considered by itself, and, on the other hand, corroborative
evidence in the sense of independent testimony proceeding from a source other
than the prosecutrix and implicating the accused; and it may be that sometimes
the distinction between those two things has not been kept clearly in view.
Historically, as Sir Richard Muir has pointed out in the cases he has cited and
in the passages he has read from Hale’s Pleas of the Crown, in sexual cases the
fact of complaint by the prosecutrix was admitted, not so much as new matter
tending to support a story sufficient in itself, but rather as an indispensable
ingredient in the story of the prosecutrix, without which the story of the
prosecutrix would be open to grave suspicion. Historically, that appears to be
the origin of the admissibility of evidence of this kind, and in the opinion of
the Court the right direction is that which is given in the case of Lillyman
in the passage already referred to.

Where an accused is charged with rape, the Judge
shall, if the only evidence that implicates the accused is the evidence, given
under oath, of the female person in respect of whom the offence is alleged to
have been committed and that evidence is not corroborated in a material
particular by evidence that implicates the accused, instruct the jury that it
is not safe to find the accused guilty in the absence of such corroboration,
but that they are entitled to find the accused guilty if they are satisfied,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that her evidence is true. (Criminal Code , s.
134 ). Furthermore and if evidence of fresh complaint has been adduced, it is
also the duty of the Judge to impress upon the jury that they are not entitled
to make use of the complaint as any evidence whatever of the facts complained
of but that evidence can only be legitimately used by them for the purpose of
enabling them to judge for themselves whether the conduct of the woman was
consistent with her testimony on oath, given in the witness box, negativing her
consent and affirming that the acts complained of were against her will, and in
accordance with the conduct they would expect in a truthful woman, under the
circumstances detailed by her. (The Queen v. Lillyman, supra, pp. 177
and 178).

[Page 407]

But there is no rule, either statutory or of
other kind, suggesting that the prosecutrix’ evidence as to fresh complaint
must itself be confirmed or corroborated. And there seems to be no valid reason
why, in cases such as the present, where the recipient of an alleged complaint
is untraceable, the prosecutrix should be denied the right to rebut, by her own
evidence of complaint, the factual presumption which would otherwise attach to
her silence as to the matter. If appellants’ contention were accepted, a
prosecutrix, complaining at the first opportunity to an untraceable witness,
might possibly be denied the right to testify that, immediately after this
first complaint, she complained to another person available as a witness, on
the basis that the former but not the latter complaint was really the one made
at the first opportunity.

For all these reasons, I agree with the majority
of the Court of Appeal that appellants’ first submission is ill-founded.

The second objection to the evidence, which is
that evidence of complaint should be limited to the fact that a complaint was
made without giving any of the particulars of it, was also considered in The
Queen v. Lillyman, supra, at page 171 et seq., and at page 177,
Hawkins J. said:

After very careful consideration we have
arrived at the conclusion that we are bound by no authority to support the
existing usage of limiting evidence of the complaint to the bare fact that a
complaint was made, and that reason and good sense are against our doing so.

It is true that in the Lillyman case, supra,
both the prosecutrix and the person to whom she complained were heard as
witnesses. However, the reasons given against limiting the evidence of the
complaint to the bare fact of that complaint are equally present in cases where
the evidence of complaint by the prosecutrix is the only evidence as to fresh
complaint.

I am also in respectful agreement with the Chief
Justice for Ontario that, in the present instance, the prosecutrix did not give
particulars.

[Page 408]

I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal. There
should be an order that the time spent in custody under the sentences, pending
the disposition of this appeal, be allowed as time served under the said sentences.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Summary convictions—Plea of
guilty—Whether right to appeal—Trial de novo—Whether right to withdraw plea—Discretion
of County Court Judge—Conviction for non-payment of sales taxes—Criminal Code ,
1958-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 720, 727—The Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100.

The accused, the registered owner of a
business, was summarily convicted and fined by a magistrate on her plea of
guilty to a charge of failing to pay sales tax. The County Court judge
dismissed her appeal and refused to strike out the plea of guilty on the
accused’s affidavit that she was only the nominal owner of the business which
was under the complete control and operation of her husband. The Court of Appeal
dismissed her further appeal and she appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

An accused who has pleaded guilty in a
summary conviction Court has the same right to apply for leave to change such
plea on his appeal by way of a trial de novo under s. 727 of the Code as
he would have had in the Court below before sentence. However, the decision as
to whether or not permission to withdraw the plea of guilty should be given is
a matter of discretion for the tribunal, and where, as here, such discretion
was exercised judicially, it should not be interfered with.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], affirming the
conviction of the Appellant. Appeal dismissed.

E.R. Murray, for the appellant.

G.W. Ford, Q.C., for the respondent.

[Page 303]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—Two informations were laid against
the appellant “carrying on business under the name and style of Majestic Lamp
Company” for failing to pay the sales tax imposed by Part VI of the Excise
Tax Act, R.S.C., 1952, c. 100, and upon these matters coming on for hearing
before S.A. Williamson, Esq., a Justice of the Peace in and for the County of
York, the appellant did not appear personally but was represented by duly
authorized counsel who pleaded “guilty” on her behalf whereupon she was duly
convicted of both offences and sentenced in respect of one information to a
fine of $466.93 or thirty days in jail and in respect of the other information
to a fine of $746.30 or alternatively to thirty days in jail.

In the proceedings before the magistrate and
after the pleas of “guilty” had been entered, the evidence of a collection
officer of the Department of National Revenue was called on behalf of the
Crown, in the course of which it was proved that the taxes referred to in the
two informations had not been paid to date and that the appellant was the sole
owner of the Majestic Lamp Company.

In due time the appellant filed and served one
notice of appeal in respect of both offences to the County Court of the County of York upon the grounds following:

1. The learned magistrate erred in his
finding that the information disclosed an offence;

2. The learned magistrate erred in failing
to apply correctly the law and the relevant provisions of the Excise Tax
Act , the Bankruptcy Act, and the Criminal Code  to the facts
of this case;

3. The learned magistrate erred in finding
that the accused had failed to comply with the said Act;

4. The learned magistrate lacked
jurisdiction to order the accused to pay the arrears of sales tax herein.

Upon the appeal coming on for hearing before His
Honour, Judge Shea, there was filed with the Court an affidavit of the
appellant setting forth that while she was the registered owner of Majestic
Lamp Company she had never at any time operated or exercised any control of the
said business nor drawn any salary or profits nor taken any interest in the
said business which was under the complete control and operation of her
husband. In this affidavit she also stated that she had never been aware of the
payment

[Page 304]

or non-payment of any sales tax until she
received the summonses and that a month or two before the date of the
informations her husband had informed her that the business was failing and
that she was bankrupt. She stated also that her husband had advised her that
the sales tax had not been paid and that she should plead “guilty”, and further
that she never realized that she would have to pay any money or be subject to a
jail sentence, believing that the money would have to be collected out of the
bankrupt estate. The affidavit concludes by stating that the appellant was at
all times up to and including the time of her conviction totally ignorant of
the whole procedure and completely under the influence of her husband and that
she had been advised that she had a good defence in law and on the merits and
that she was not guilty of the offences.

In the course of the hearing before the learned
County Court judge, there was a lengthy argument between counsel, and
conflicting decisions were cited as to whether an appeal lay in this case under
the provisions of ss. 720  to 727  of the Criminal Code , and in the course
of these submissions counsel on behalf of the appellant made the following
statement:

The facts they are not in dispute; the
evidence was put in by the crown at the magistrate’s court proceedings; we do
not quarrel with that, as far as the facts go, and I do not think they are in
dispute. The sole question is whether the conviction itself is bad in law.

The learned County Court judge, having the
aforesaid affidavit before him and having heard what was said by the
appellant’s counsel, made the following statement:

…I do not think it will be necessary to
have this plea of guilty renewed; there is no exceptional circumstance here.
This woman has pleaded guilty, and then she found out that she might be called
on to pay money and that is something else.

That is the whole point; and not only was
she represented by counsel at the trial,—anyway, she pleaded guilty…

I decline to strike out the plea of guilty.

The learned County Court judge saw no merit in
the other grounds of appeal and the appeal was accordingly dismissed. The
appellant appealed from this decision to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] upon the following grounds:

1. The learned County Court Judge erred in
holding that the Appellant was precluded from her right to appeal by reason of
her having pleaded guilty before the Magistrate.

[Page 305]

2. The learned County Court Judge erred in
refusing to hear evidence on the ground that the Appellant was precluded from
adducing evidence by reason of her having pleaded guilty before the Magistrate.

3. The learned County Court Judge
misdirected himself with respect to the right of the Appellant to change her
plea on a trial de novo.

4. The learned County Court Judge erred in
holding in effect that the plea of guilty was not only an admission as to fact
but as to law.

5. The learned County Court Judge erred in
refusing the Appellant the right to argue that the Crown had no right to
proceed against the Appellant notwithstanding her plea of guilty.

On this appeal two identical notices of appeal
were prepared respecting the two offences of which the appellant had been
convicted, and the appeals having been heard together Roach J.A. rendered the
decision of the Court dismissing both appeals. It is from this decision and the
order made pursuant thereto that the appellant now appeals to this Court upon
the following grounds:

(a) That the proceedings in
the County Court of the County of York were a nullity because the accused was
not arraigned on the charges or asked to plead to same;

(b) That the learned County
Court judge erred in refusing to hear evidence on the ground that the appellant
was precluded from adducing evidence by reason of her having pleaded guilty
before the Magistrate;

(c) That the learned County Court
judge misdirected himself with respect to the right of the appellant to change
her plea on a trial de novo;

(d) Such further and other
grounds as counsel may advise and which this Honourable Court may deem
sufficient grounds for appeal.

After reading the transcript of the proceedings
before the County Court judge which are included in the appeal book in the
present case, I am satisfied that the second and third of the above grounds
disclose a misunderstanding of what took place in the County Court.

As to the first ground, it will appear from what
has been said in the cases of Regina v. Dennis[3] and Regina v. Bamsey[4] that I am of opinion that the
arraignment and plea form no essential part of the trial de novo contemplated
by s. 727  of the Criminal Code , but that an accused who has pleaded

[Page 306]

guilty in the summary conviction Court has the
same right to apply for leave to change his plea before the Appeal Court as he
would have had in the Court below before sentence.

As to the second and third of the above grounds,
it is enough to say that the record of the proceedings in the County Court does
not disclose that the learned County Court judge either precluded the
appellant from adducing evidence or misdirected himself respecting her right to
change her plea.

The learned County Court judge, having read the
appellant’s affidavit and heard the argument, exercised his discretion by
declining to strike out the plea of guilty. That he was entitled to follow this
course is made apparent by what was said by Cartwright J., speaking on behalf
of the majority of the Court, in Thibodeau v. The Queen[5]:

…it may first be observed that it is clear
that at any time before sentence the Court has power to permit a plea of guilty
to be withdrawn. As to this it is sufficient to refer to the following cases; R.
v. Plummer, (1902) 2 K.B. 339, The King v. Lamothe, 15 C.C.C. 61, R.
v. Guay, 23 C.C.C. 243 at 245-246, and R. v. Nelson, 32 C.C.C. 75.
These cases make it equally clear that the decision whether or not permission
to withdraw a plea of guilty should be given rests in the discretion of the
Judge to whom the application for such permission is made and that this
discretion, if exercised judicially, will not be lightly interfered with.

(The italics are mine.)

As I have indicated, I am of opinion that the
learned County Court judge in no way exceeded his jurisdiction and that his
reasons and decisions in refusing to allow the appellant to change her plea
disclose no error in law.

I can see no other grounds for allowing this
appeal and in fact none were seriously urged at the argument. The appeal must,
therefore, be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.
